          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday we had a number of questions, statements and the debate on a Labour Party motion in respect of the banking crisis and an investigation into that.  The Government has published its proposals.  Those proposals do not take into account the extent of public anger that is out there.  I agree with the words of the Minister for Finance this morning when he said that what the public want to see is the law of the land implemented in respect of malpractice in banks and financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Two investigations are ongoing in that regard, one by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and another by the fraud squad.  I had hoped those investigations would have been brought to a conclusion earlier, but they are proceeding.  When one considers the back-to-back loans, for instance, that were in evidence, which were electronic transactions, an investigation could have been completed in two hours and a file prepared for the DPP.  In any event, the position in so far as the Government is now concerned is that there will be no forensic analysis of regulatory and policy failures or internal and audit competency that the public will be able to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The public could see what happened with the committee of investigation into the Iraq war in Britain, or the financial inquiry commission in the United States.  The Government has made a strong defence of the commission of investigation facility by saying the Murphy inquiry worked well, as did a number of other inquiries, which they did, but the victims in those cases were children who were victims of sexual abuse and the inquiries had to be held in private.  The victims in these cases are the working taxpayers of this country who are now faced with pensions lost, negative equity, difficulty in paying mortgages and an understanding and perception that white collar crime does pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The way the Government published its proposals yesterday means there will be no forensic public analysis of what happened.  It effectively means the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, who has said he wants to co-operate fully in any way he can, will not be called before an Oireachtas committee to give evidence.  Why would that happen if what I assume is being talked about takes place, that the committee in question would be chaired by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and would be most unlikely to call the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, or the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy?  In effect, the Government proposals for the scoping facility, the terms of reference for the commission of investigation and an Oireachtas committee being sidelined to the role of commentator means that there will not be public scrutiny and members of the public will not be able to see what happens in respect of the regulatory and policy failures that are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">Does the Taoiseach accept that, in effect, following the proposals announced in a gushing fashion by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, after his green summit with Fianna Fáil, the Taoiseach will never have to give evidence in public to account for policy positions adopted by him and his colleagues in Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_12">——not what people think or assume are the causes, and to do so through the use of the best available expertise and in a timely and cost effective manner.  The framework which has been brought forward by Government seeks to learn from the lessons of the past where inquiries have gone on for too long and to ensure that answers are obtained as quickly as possible and within a timeframe in which they can inform what needs to be done.  Ireland's international reputation would not be assisted by an inefficient inquiry that is not focused.  Such an inquiry would not serve the public as it would inhibit, not assist, the steps necessary for recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Each of the three essential stages of the inquiry involves the Oireachtas or uses a process determined by it.  The first stage involves a preliminary consideration of the causes of the regulatory failures and banking crisis by independent experts.  The Oireachtas will be involved from the beginning because the Oireachtas committee will meet the Governor of the Central Bank and the independent expert or experts at the outset to brief them on the priorities of the Oireachtas for investigation.  Those experts will independently consider what happened, provide their preliminary view on the causes, decide what needs to be done and the further investigation that needs to be carried out.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_19">That method of inquiry has worked well in the past, most recently in the context of the Murphy report.  The commission of investigation has been provided by the Oireachtas with all the powers the Oireachtas believes are necessary to enable it to investigate a matter of significant public concern.  The tight timeline for the work will ensure the report of the commission is available to the Oireachtas for further consideration and action as quickly as possible thereafter.  That method of inquiry has been supported and a law passed by the Oireachtas which some Members now seem to claim constitutes a whitewash.  The third stage involves the consideration of the report by the Oireachtas and action by an appropriate Oireachtas committee.  The suggestion that the inquiry is a whitewash because hearings will be in private makes no sense.  It is the findings and recommendations that are of importance.  These will be published, considered and debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Those that make the allegation of a whitewash are really complaining that not every wild allegation can be published or proffered.  The public are interested in balanced findings that ascertain what went wrong and provide guidance as to how mistakes can be avoided in the future.  We have outlined a means by which an independent statutory inquiry can take place by assembling the facts through the reports that will be done by the governor and an independent expert, and to proceed thereafter as the Oireachtas sees fit.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_23">It may well be that the Governor of the Central Bank, a person to whom no fault can be imputed, wants an inquiry because the Central Bank was obviously centrally involved in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I want to ask the Taoiseach two further questions.  First, he said that when the commission of investigation completes its work, it will all be done in private.  The findings of the commission of investigation, as the Taoiseach said, will be published, considered and debated by the Oireachtas committee, presumably under the control of a Fianna Fáil chairman.  What is the function of that consideration if, for example, somebody produces evidence of a "deep throat" nature that was not considered by the commission of investigation?  Will the Oireachtas committee have the opportunity and responsibility for further investigation, if necessary?  Will it be in a position to change the published findings of the commission of investigation if such evidence were to come forward?</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Second, my contention is that, under the current structure, neither the Taoiseach, Mr. Charlie McCreevy or Deputy Bertie Ahern, as people involved in the Department of Finance and high political office, will be required to give evidence in public.  However, I take the Taoiseach at his word.  He has said on more than one occasion that he always accepts responsibility for his actions, he stands over them and he wants to co-operate in whatever way is possible in the public interest.  I accept that.  If that is the case, he will be aware that the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, section 11, clearly states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_26">A commission shall conduct its investigation in private unless—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_27">(<i>a</i>) a witness requests that all or part of his or her evidence be heard in public and the commission grants the request,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_28">or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_29">(<i>b</i>) the commission is satisfied that it is desirable in the interests of both the investigation and fair procedures to hear all or part of the evidence of a witness in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I would like the Taoiseach to confirm now to the Dáil that, because there are no constitutional or legal impediments to a forensic analysis of the policy decisions that the Taoiseach directed as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, those hearings of the commission of investigation will be held in public in accordance with section 11 of the 2004 Act.  That would go some small way to at least enabling the public to see some people answer for policy decisions that were taken when they were given that responsibility.  Will the Taoiseach direct, as is his right, that the terms of the reference for the commission of investigation stipulate that the policy analysis of himself and his fellow Ministers and predecessors will be heard in public?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_31">As the Deputy said, the commission of investigation is set up under the relevant Act and it can decide to meet in public in whatever way it wishes.  I have no problem dealing with these matters in any way that enables me to deal with my public duties and discharge them publicly.  I am accountable to this House on a daily basis for every decision I have made both now and in the past.  I have no problem in regard to any of these matters as to how the commission wishes to proceed and I will facilitate all of that without any difficulty in terms of how I deal with my responsibilities.  The commission of investigation is set up under the Act.  It determines how it proceeds and I will comply with any procedure that arises.  There is no problem on my part.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">The interaction between the Department, the Central Bank, the regulator and all the rest is a part of the scoping exercise that will be conducted by the Central Bank governor and the independent expert.  Arising out of and based on the conclusions that will come from those reports, terms of reference will be decided upon by the Oireachtas.  Whatever emerges and has to be investigated, the Government and every one of its members will facilitate, assist and co-operate in every way possible.  We are obliged to do that anyway.  I have no problem whatever with that.  The continuing political charge that the Deputy makes that in some way——</p>

          <p eId="para_34">——Deputy Brian Cowen has a problem with the tribunal is nonsense.  What I did say from the outset as Taoiseach, and have always said, is that these matters must have careful consideration.  We have seen in the past, in the aftermath of tribunals of inquiry held under other Acts, that every time one is held, someone says "We will never do it this way again" and they then jump straight in and we have another one that goes on for ten or 12 years at a cost of €200 million or €300 million to the taxpayer.</p>

That is the position.  There is no ambiguity about it.  There is no reluctance on my part whatsoever.  I have a responsibility to discharge and I will discharge it.  I hope the Deputy will do the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">The Taoiseach's response to the call for a public inquiry — I heard the Minister for Finance this morning making the same point — is to attack the idea of a tribunal.   Nobody is proposing the establishment of a tribunal.  What the Labour Party has proposed is that there should be a parliamentary inquiry similar to the DIRT inquiry.  The Government should stop knocking something that has not been proposed in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">There are two issues here, first, whether the inquiry will be public or private.  Fianna Fáil wants a private inquiry.  The rest of us want a public inquiry.  The decision on that will be made tonight when we vote on the Labour Party motion and every Member of the House, including the Green Party Ministers and Deputies who claim they want a public inquiry, will have the opportunity to vote for a private or public inquiry at 8.30 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">What I want to concentrate on is the content of the Government's proposed inquiry.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said that inquiry would not be permitted to examine decisions taken by the Government since the crisis erupted, such as the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank or the decision to introduce the bank guarantee scheme.  I heard him on radio this morning making a similar suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Suppose the British Government took that approach to the current inquiry on the Iraq war, which we see on television.  It would have an inquiry which would be questioning whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and what the United Nations discussed and decided, but the only thing into which it would not be able to inquire would be the British Government's decision to go to war, which of course would have the convenient consequence that Mr. Blair would not have to appear as a witness, as he is on Friday, and nor would Mr. Hoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">What the Government is doing here is setting up an inquiry into everything about banking, including the international context, except the Government's own decisions, such as the critical decision to introduce the guarantee scheme, which is what has locked the Irish taxpayer into paying for the banking crisis.  There were several issues involved in September 2008, particularly on 29 September 2008, which require to be investigated and require answers.  With whom did members of the Government meet on that date?  Why was a decision taken to give a guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_44">We can understand the systemic importance of the two big banks with branches in every town in Ireland but why did the Government decide to give a guarantee to what was a piggy bank for rogue developers in many cases, as we now know?  We have seen that within four months it had to be nationalised, with huge sums of the taxpayers' hard-earned money put in to keep it afloat.  These decisions should be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Why did the Government decide, for example, to include dated subordinated debt, which I asked about at the time but did not get an answer in the debate on the guarantee scheme?  With whom did the Government members meet on the day it was decided to bring in the guarantee scheme?  Was a Bill prepared, as we heard, on that occasion to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank prior to the introduction of the guarantee scheme?  Why did it not proceed?</p>
          <p eId="para_46">What the Government is proposing will exclude any investigation of these issues.  Will the Taoiseach agree, at a minimum, to include in this process of investigation of any kind concerning the banking system the decisions made by the Government in September 2008, the reasons for them and the discussions which were had leading to them?</p>

The Deputy will continue to come to this House for the next 18 months as he has for the past 18 months saying he did not agree with that decision.  That is fine as it is his position.  The consequences of going with his policy position at the time would have been a meltdown in the financial system.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">We can hear their opinions on whether Anglo Irish Bank should have been saved at that stage.  Some €11 billion of taxpayers' money has gone into these banks to date.  Within four months of the Government introducing a guarantee for Anglo Irish Bank, it had to be nationalised.  The cost is enormous.  We can leave aside the issue of whether the inquiry will be held in public or private for a moment as it will be decided by a vote tonight, and everybody can make up their own mind on it and answer for their vote to the electorate afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The critical element is that the Government is excluding — even from the private inquiry it is now conceding — the critical decision in respect of Anglo Irish Bank in particular.  This was a delinquent bank and rotten apple at the heart of the banking system which lent money recklessly.  We saw a recent "Prime Time" programme on what was happening in some of the institutions.  On 29 September 2008, the Government took the decision to give a State guarantee to that institution as it was to Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks on the grounds that it was of systemic importance.  That is the big conundrum and such a major question requires answers.  No answers have been provided for that here.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">This is one of the issues I want to see examined and investigated by whatever type of inquiry is established but it has been excluded from the Government's proposals.</p>

What he is now establishing is not an inquiry into what went wrong in the banking system so that we can learn from it.  He is establishing something to cover the tracks of bad decisions made by him and his Government for whatever reason, which is not acceptable to us and I do not believe it will be acceptable to the public.</p>

We came to this House in 2004 to learn from those lessons of the past under the various tribunals of another Act.  We said there would be a committee of investigation giving us the benefit of tribunal-like powers for the commission but not the costs associated with tribunals in the past and the time lags involved in proceeding with issues of public concern.  Under the Act they are supposed to be matters of urgent public importance but they are still being considered a dozen years on.</p>

We should make sure we deal with all aspects of the matter and then come to this House on the basis of assembling those facts and decide what it is we want to do at that stage.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide, but it is also clear from the Supreme Court and elsewhere that the question of using Oireachtas committees for the purpose of bringing forward facts, which are controverted, is not a means by which we can operate in a way that will have full constitutional protection.  What we are better off doing is getting on with what we have achieved and what has been proven to work.  We should make that happen and then the Oireachtas can deal with it.

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_148">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">The total allocation for my Department in the Estimates set out in the budget book for 2010 is €28.818 million.  This is an overall decrease of 11.8%, or €3.868 million, on the 2009 revised estimate allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">The estimate for 2010 contains a number of significant changes to the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Of the nine programme subheads in the estimate for 2009, six have been discontinued for 2010.  These are the McCracken tribunal, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, the National Forum on Europe, the Newfoundland and Labrador Business Partnerships, the MacEntee Commission of Investigation and the Active Citizenship Office.  In several cases, the activities funded under these subheads have come to a natural conclusion.  In other cases, the Government decided to cease the relevant activities or to continue to support them from within the existing resources of my Department.  Of the remaining programme subheads, there has been a reduction of 24% in the funding allocated to the National Economic and Social Development Office, and of 41% in the allocation for commemoration initiatives.  The allocation for the Moriarty tribunal, at €7.5 million, is unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">On the administrative budget, the overall reduction in the estimate for 2010 is 5%.  The administration subheads will be further adjusted in the revised estimate when the effect of the budget reductions in pay is applied.  The reductions in public service pay announced by the Minister for Finance in the 2010 budget will naturally apply to all staff in my Department and in the National Economic and Social Development Office.  As a result the overall payroll cost for my Department and the National Economic and Social Development Office will reduce by approximately €957,000, representing an average wage reduction of 6.5% for the total number of 233 staff involved.  The budget did not contain any provisions in regard to staff numbers for my Department or its agencies and I do not expect any changes in existing service levels to occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">I look forward to addressing specific issues relating to the Estimates provisions when they are considered in the usual way by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I also look forward to responding to questions which Deputies may wish to table separately on specific aspects of the work of my Department.  It is envisaged that the Revised Estimates for 2010 will be published in February 2010.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_157">Civil Service unions have announced their intention to undertake work to rule action.  Has this commenced and if so, how is it affecting the workings of the Taoiseach's Department?  Has his or other Departments received notice of intent to take industrial action to restore pay rates and if not, does he anticipate such notice?</p>
            <p eId="para_158">In the period since the announcement of the budget each of us in our respective constituencies have been exposed to the daily reality of many people on the lower income levels in the public service.  We are being asked what we can do and what answers have we got.  What answers would the Taoiseach give in the case of a typical public servant?  A clerical worker who earned approximately €21,000 per annum in 2009 lost almost €300 to the pension levy and €370 to the income levy.  Following the budget she will take a pay cut of 5% or €1050, and will also lose €32 in child benefit a month.  She cannot afford to make ends meet.  That is the daily reality for many people of which the Taoiseach and other Deputies must be aware.  That woman has two young children, a large mortgage and her husband has only part-time work and earns an income of only €245 per week.  How do I respond to that woman when she puts it to me that she cannot understand why the lower paid public servants should be hit with a second pay cut within a ten month period and why the higher paid are again being protected?</p>
            <p eId="para_159">We need some answers.  What response is the Taoiseach giving in such instances?  How has he addressed similar cases that must be reflected within his Department and others and some of the agencies working directly under his Department?  There is little or no comprehension by the Taoiseach and other Ministers of the daily reality that low to middle income public servants have to face as a consequence of the measures introduced by his Government during 2009, which seriously impact on their lives as we face into 2010.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_123">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_160">People must understand that if we are borrowing €400 million a week, that is an unsustainable position and we will put at risk jobs in all sectors of the economy, including the public service, unless we take remedial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">On the question of pay rates, savings of €1 billion have to be applied for 2010 arising from decisions we had to make in the budget on the pay issue.  I emphasise that the Government has applied the pay reductions in a progressive way, unlike what the Deputy said.  As with all the adjustments to the cost of public service pay, it has meant that lower paid public servants have suffered less of a net loss proportionately than those on the higher paid grades.  A Civil Service clerical officer on the mid-point of the scale will have suffered a net loss over the course of the three budgets since autumn 2008 of approximately 11.7% of pay.  The loss is still significant but should be compared to the net loss of those on higher paid grades.  In the same period an assistant secretary has suffered a net loss of more than 24% of pay and a deputy secretary a net loss of more than 27% of pay.  The highest paid civil servants — level 1 Secretaries General — who volunteered to take an additional pay reduction have seen their net pay reduce by more than one third.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that there has not been a progressive proportionate hit on pay, according as one goes up the scales of salaries and remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">It must also be pointed out with regard to assistant secretaries and equivalent grades that their pay was found by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector not to be out of line with comparable grades in the eurozone. Applying the full reduction recommended by the body would have meant an effective average reduction of 18% in the remuneration package of an assistant secretary and 22% in that of a deputy secretary, both of which are greater than the reductions applied to other public servants, including Secretaries General.  The Minister for Finance considered this to be inappropriate and decided that a different arrangement should apply to certain Civil Service and related grades in which the scheme of performance-related awards has been terminated.  In all, approximately 600 employees in the public service are affected.  The Minister therefore decided that the reduction for the grades of assistant and deputy secretary and related grades should comprise both the reduction in the salary scale and the termination of the award scheme, which is an effective reduction of 11.8% for assistant secretaries and 14% for deputy secretaries.  Those are the full facts.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">Given that most public servants earn around €50,000 or less, in order to achieve the necessary savings it was not possible to exclude any group from the pay cut.  However, the rates by which pay is being cut are progressive, with the lowest paid affected least.  Reductions in remuneration range from 5% for the lower paid to 8% in the case of salaries up to €125,000.  Salaries above that level are adjusted in line with the recommendations of the review body; in those cases the entire salary will be reduced by 8% for salaries of €125,000 to €165,000, 12% for salaries of €165,000 to €200,000, and 15% for salaries of €200,000 or more.  The salary of the Secretary General of my Department has been reduced by 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">This pay cut applies to all public servants in every area of the public service, including the Civil Service, local government, the health and education sectors, the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, non-commercial semi-State bodies and political office holders.  Exceptions are being considered in view of this.  Those are the full facts.  There is an idea that the cuts are not progressive, but when everything is taken into account they are progressive.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">With regard to the possibility of industrial relations problems, I do not believe industrial action will serve any purpose.  The response of the unions is a matter for the unions themselves.  I would like to see them come back to the issues that need to be considered sooner rather than later.  We need to consider non-pay issues as a means of ensuring that we are in a position, in due course, to maintain salary levels as they are at the moment.  The decisions we had to take in December are in place and are now part of the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">Do I understand that notice of a work-to-rule action or intent to give effect to industrial action has not been served on the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments by the representative trade unions?  Can the Taoiseach clarify the facts in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_167">With respect to the Taoiseach's claim that the cuts will affect people proportionately, he should make no mistake about it: a cut of €1,720 to an income of €21,000 is a devastating blow for a young woman with children whose husband is working part-time, with all the commitments they must face.  In terms of a paper presentation of comparative percentage drops——</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_169">That is what we are talking about — percentage this, percentage that across the different income levels.  It does not translate into reality or illustrate what people are facing on a daily basis.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that the impact on this woman's circumstances is much graver than is indicated by stating the percentage drop compared to the highest income earners within the public service?  It is an indisputable fact and if the Taoiseach does not accept it he is far removed from the reality of ordinary people's lives.  I can tell him it is a serious situation for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">How can the Taoiseach justify these cuts for people at the lowest income level while at the same time setting aside from his Department's budget some €400,000 annually to support no less than three advisers for the Minister for Health and Children?  He indicated that to us in response to parliamentary questions last year.  A total of €400,000 is paid to three people for taking an advisory role to the Minister in a different Department.  Does that cross-departmental arrangement apply in any other situation?  Why should it apply in the case of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney?  Why should the Taoiseach's Department be the bail-out Department, transferring funds to the Department of Health and Children?  The income earnings of those people far exceed those of ordinary low- to middle-income earners in the Taoiseach's Department, yet he is quite happy to make a transfer of more than €400,000 annually to the Minister in order to ensure her goodwill and allow her to act, as she has done over a number of years, as the apron for the attacks on the health system, saving the face of the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_171">I suppose Question Time gives the Deputy a chance to do what he is doing now.  However, the fact is that the health service costs €15 billion.  If the Deputy thinks the Minister should carry out her functions without independent advice, that is his opinion, but it is of no relevance to the pay cuts of more than €1 billion in the public service.  Those employees are subject to the same cuts in remuneration as people in the public service.  They are not being treated any differently.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_173">The Deputy is suggesting that if we did not have advisers we would not have to implement measures such as pay cuts.  That is nonsense.  We have a serious budgetary crisis that must be dealt with on both the pay side and the non-pay side.  It is unfortunate.  I would rather we did not have to consider such proposals, but we did.  Such measures had to be taken.  I am simply telling the Deputy that they are progressive and that those on lower wages are being asked to pay less.  Ideally, we would like to be in a position to exempt low-paid people, but it is not possible to obtain savings of that magnitude from the public service pay bill when so many public servants are on salaries of €50,000 or less.  The idea that we could find the money somewhere else and make up €1 billion from the public service pay bill in some other way is not feasible.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">The Deputy has had his day on that one.  The Government had to take decisions to implement cuts of between 5% and 8% across the board in the public service.  I have outlined the progressive nature of those decisions.  If the Deputy considers the decisions we have taken since the crisis began he will see the percentages confirm that the cuts are progressive.  They must be progressive in the interests of fairness all around.  There are many other people outside the public sector who have unfortunately lost their jobs.  The question of security of employment must also be taken into consideration.  We must try to implement reforms in the public service and proceed in the years ahead on the basis of what is affordable and what is coming into the Exchequer, and that will involve much effort on everyone's part.  The idea that there is a simple black-and-white solution is not correct.</p>

ICTU will meet again this week and it has indicated its position publicly.  Some unions have corresponded with management in these matters.  As Taoiseach, I do not believe industrial action will provide a solution to any of these problems.  In fact, it would affect services, which we need to avoid, particularly at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I have some questions for the Taoiseach about the cuts in pay to staff of his Department.  Have these pay cuts already commenced, and from what date did they commence?</p>
            <p eId="para_179">Second, I refer to the decision that was taken subsequent to the Act being passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas to vary the manner in which it was to be applied to the grades of assistant and deputy secretary.  Was that decision taken by the Government and was the Taoiseach personally involved in it?  Third, the Taoiseach will recall that before Christmas, I asked him about the issue of staff who are employed by bodies which are funded by the public purse.  I referred specifically to bodies such as charities and various non-governmental organisations and, in response, the Government introduced an amendment to the legislation to the effect that the pay cuts would apply only to those who enjoyed public sector pensions.  I understand that the Health Service Executive has issued a circular to the bodies it funds directing them to cut the pay of the staffs concerned, many of which staffs are lowly paid, including those of various charities.  What is the legal basis, if any, for such a circular and what is the position in this regard?  Finally, when does the Taoiseach expect the Moriarty tribunal to report?</p>

While it is a matter that will be dealt with by the Department of Finance, I will convey the detail to the Deputy.  I am not personally aware of the circular in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">As the Deputy is aware, the legislation was enacted for the purpose of being introduced during the course of 2010 and it now is in place.  People will see this in their salaries and monthly cheques when they come through this month.  People will see the changes that must be imposed, as I have stated, for reasons of financial necessity from the Government's point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">The other matter raised by the Deputy pertained to the Moriarty tribunal.  I received correspondence in this regard before Christmas and I believe a report is due next month.  I will convey to the Deputy the precise information that was conveyed to me by the chairman.  I believe it will be next month and certainly it will be soon.</p>

I wish to pursue the other two matters I raised a little further.  The Taoiseach did not respond to the question I asked about the decision that was taken to apply the cut to the salaries of assistant and deputy secretaries and similar grades on the basis of the consolidated pay plus bonus that had been removed previously.  I asked the Taoiseach whether this was a decision taken by the Government and whether he was involved in that decision and I seek an answer in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">I am unclear in respect of the application of the pay cuts.  I appreciate that the legislation was passed and that it was to have applied to 2010.  My question was whether the process of cutting pay has begun and from what date.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">Yes, I will come to that.  My recollection is that this issue was mentioned by the Minister for Finance at Cabinet.  Approximately one third of those covered by the review body have been affected by the termination of an applicable performance-related awards scheme.  The pay to one group, assistant secretaries, was found by the review body not to be out of line, having regard to its comparators in the eurozone.  On the other hand, applying the full reduction recommended by the body would have meant an effective reduction of an average of 18% and 22% in the remuneration packages of assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries, respectively, which would be higher than for other public servants, including Secretaries General.  The Minister for Finance considered that this was not appropriate and decided that a different arrangement should apply to certain Civil Service and related grades where a scheme of performance-related awards has been terminated. In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, I made the point that approximately 600 employees in the public service would be affected.  In those cases, the reduction comprises both the reduction in the salary scale and the termination of the awards scheme.  I already have given the other information in reply to the previous question from Deputy Ó Caoláin.  The Minister brought his obligation to consider the matter to the Government's attention and he subsequently made the decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_191">Does the Taoiseach accept that much of the resentment arising from the Estimates and the budget is focused on the perception within the public service, which I consider to be supported by the facts, that the top levels of the Civil Service were able to look after themselves whereas this was not the case down the line?  Does he accept that the reason cuts were avoided at the top level may have been because those involved have an influence in the final decisions that were made?  This resentment is not simply felt by civil servants but also by the public.  As for the top levels of the Civil Service, does he perceive a further problem regarding the position of Secretaries General?  I refer to a supposed policy whereby they are meant to retire after seven years.  However, this policy is not being adhered to and in many instances, they are staying on in the public service.  Moreover, they are staying on at the same level of salary and no matter what their position, their salaries continue to be paid at Secretary General level.</p>

            <p eId="para_193">I am talking about the Estimates, including one in particular which is the direct responsibility of the Taoiseach.  I refer to the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, where the office is renewed after the seven-year period at the same salary.  Moreover, the same principle applies even if those concerned are not renewed in the same office.  Those who get another position within the Civil Service receive the same Secretary General salary right through to the end.  Does the Taoiseach accept this hardly is an acceptable implementation of the policy that was introduced to put a term limit of seven years on the appointment of Secretaries General?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_145">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_194">I would argue that the term limit has seen a high turnover at senior management level within the Civil Service.  While I understand the thinking behind the reason it was introduced, people must consider whether it brings too great a turnover rate wherein people have been lost who one would have wished to stay on, if possible.  There are pluses and minuses in respect of some of these matters.  I accept that the position whereby a person who was appointed to such a position at a young age would remain there right up to retirement age, was not good either.  It constitutes the other extreme to the argument.  It is a question of trying to find the balance and reviewing how the policy has worked out in the light of experience.  While there still are many benefits to the system, it is like every other issue, in that were one to go over it again, one should consider how one might tweak certain aspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">The Deputy suggested that people looked after themselves.  There are independent processes.  The review group on higher remuneration dictated the outcomes in the context of the job given to it by the Minister for Finance to make comparisons with similar sized countries.  The comparisons at assistant secretary grade were in sync with other countries, whereas other higher grades were not in sync with these countries and, therefore, reductions were recommended.  If anomalies arise in respect of the grades the review body was asked to look at and other related grades, there is also provision for the Minister to deal with them and the review body report refers to that.  It is not correct to say it is a ready up for higher grades to look after themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_197">It is for us in public office to dispel that notion where it is not well grounded.  Pay is not determined by those who hold the grade.  Pay levels are recommended by an outside body.  If someone says to a Deputy it is done another way, it is our job to say that is not the case even though that person might not like the outcome and he or she might have views on this issue.  This is not an arbitrary system because that would not help morale in any way.  It is difficult enough for people to take pay cuts but the notion that it is a total ready up is not the situation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_198">One of the core objectives of the Taoiseach's Department is public service modernisation and he believes this is a key priority of the Department.  With regard to the staff numbers in the public modernisation section of the Department, even though the issue has moved up the scale in priority within the Department in the past three years, staffing levels have not increased.  Does the Taoiseach believe he can deliver on the objective of transforming the public service with the present staff complement?</p>
            <p eId="para_199">I refer to the delivery of the modernisation programme.  In the context of the changes that took place prior to Christmas regarding the pay cuts for senior management as a result of the order signed by the Minister for Finance, does the Taoiseach think it will be more difficult to deliver the programme?  Many pubic servants are extremely hurt by the way they feel they have been hung out to dry by the Government while senior officials, who should have taken decisions to streamline the public service and to save taxpayers' money, turned a blind eye to the need to change and to restructure and were given bonuses, which have been credited against pay cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">My understanding is a bonus is not calculated as part of one's salary and it is paid on top of one's salary.  Pay cuts should be applied to salaries and not bonuses.  The structure adopted in the public service gives officials a double payment as a result of the initial bonus payment and the recent credit they have been given against pay cuts that everyone else has to take.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_149">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_201">I do not agree with that argument because the introduction of the performance-related bonus system for these grades was taken into account in determining salary levels by review bodies in the past.  In other words, the existence of the system was taken into account when the review body was deciding the salary levels because the system was based on a discretionary decision by senior management, year on year, depending on performance and that is the part of the balance between performance and bonus systems always.  That the incentive exists for these grades and not for others was taken into account in determining salary levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">That is borne out by the fact that when the comparison was made between the assistant secretary grade and its equivalent in other countries in the exercise the Minister for Finance asked the review body to conduct, it was shown it was more in line with foreign salary levels than was the case with other grades.  That confirms that in determining salary levels in the past the existence of the performance-related bonus scheme was taken into account by the review body and, therefore, on the basis that we were terminating the scheme, had the proposed pay reductions been applied then to this grade, as recommended, these officials would have faced a higher reduction than officials in higher grades.  We had to make an adjustment to maintain the principle of progressivity.  One has to do what is fair in all circumstances but some people, perhaps representing lower grades, said these officials were taking a smaller pay cut than their members.  That is not the case and if the Deputy examines the measures we have had to take since the crisis emerged, the percentage reduction for this grade is rightly well over double that of lower grades, which is what one would expect.</p>

            <p eId="para_206">I refer again to the way in which the decision was made to vary the application of the pay cuts in the case of the higher grades because I am unclear.  As I understand it, the decision was made by the Minister for Finance and the Government was informed.  Had the Minister discretion in the way in which the pay cut was applied?  The Taoiseach explained the rationale for changing the way it was applied to assistant secretaries.  If, for example, low paid public servants demonstrated that the effect of the pay cut would leave them worse off than if they were on social welfare, would the Minister have discretion to similarly vary the way in which the pay cut is applied?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_154">

            <p eId="para_207">The Government obtained recommendations and it is a matter for the Government to implement them or not, as the case may be.  In the case of pay issues, one would look to do that.  If an objectively-based anomaly arose, which the review body acknowledges may have to be catered for because of the limited number of grades being examined for the purpose of the exercise in which it is engaged, the Minister for Finance would have to make technical adjustments to accommodate them.  There is a reference in the body of the report to this fact:</p>
            <p eId="para_208">This issue arose and it had to be considered by the Minister, who felt, taking into account all the facts, that he would proceed as he did and there was an objective reason for that.  It was not an attempt to show favouritism to one grade over another.  The issue arose and there were good grounds for the decision, which I have set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">Of course pay reductions impose a certain degree of hardship on people, who I understand have existing commitments, but if we had to make those reductions then last year was the year to do so because there were reductions in the cost of living of the order of 6.5%.  The purchasing power of the salaries that were being adjusted was maintained and that makes last year unique compared to other years which have an inflationary effect.  The overriding reason was that it was necessary to adjust the pay bill given its size in terms of overall Exchequer spend.  One could not make a €4 billion adjustment, which I think everyone in the House accepted was necessary given the fiscal situation, without seeking a contribution of the order we sought on the pay side.  Otherwise one would be asking the non-pay side and the delivery of services to take a hit that would greatly affect the level of service one could guarantee.  In a difficult situation this was the best outcome that could be formulated by the Government, looking at the facts of the situation as they faced us at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The Minister for Health and Children set out the position on the question of the private health insurance market and the policy options available.  It is also important to state that she is committed to developing during the session a comprehensive set of measures to bring stability to the private health insurance market.  This includes a regulatory status and the sustainable structure of capitalisation of the VHI.  Many issues are being examined and I cannot anticipate Government discussion or decisions.  It is being dealt with by the Minister and will be brought to the Government in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">On the devolution of policing and justice matters in Northern Ireland, talks are ongoing and these matters are being dealt with in direct discussions by the parties themselves.  We have to hope a successful outcome will come to those discussions.  It is important that this be the case.  I impressed the urgency of the situation on the Prime Minister when I met him recently.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">About 100 flights in and out of Ireland have been cancelled this afternoon as a result of industrial action taken by air traffic controllers.  Spokespersons for both the Irish Aviation Authority and the trade union concerned were on television last night and they effectively said that this was going to escalate.  One spokesperson stated that more air traffic controllers were likely to be suspended, while the other warned that there would be more industrial action as a consequence.  Whatever the issues in dispute, what is happening is disproportionate in terms of disruption to the travelling public and the country's reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">If this type of thing had happened at any time over the past 20 years, there would have been a mechanism for dealing with it under the social partnership process.  However, as a result of the Government ending the social partnership process before Christmas, there is no longer a mechanism for dealing with this kind of dispute and for the national implementation body to intervene and knock heads together.  What arrangements are being made for the Minister for Transport to report to the House on what is happening?  What efforts is the Taoiseach making to bring that dispute to an end and ensure that people are able to travel?</p>

When will the prescription charges Bill be published?  Would the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity, after careful reflection, not to proceed with this proposal?  Given that this Bill will fundamentally alter the medical card scheme, what is the position of the Government in respect of the eligibility for health and personal services Bill?  I have asked this question year after year, but the Government always claims not to be in a position to indicate when it will be published.  Does the Taoiseach accept that this is a very important Bill?  Given the other changes taking place, there is an increased urgency in bringing forward that Bill.  Is the Government refusing to publish the Bill, given our individual or collective eligibility for health and personal social services?</p>

Children are being deleteriously affected by this problem.  There have been admissions to psychiatric hospitals and at least one death has occurred.  We have also had cases of serious injury caused by people jumping off roofs and so forth.  This is a serious issue which must not remain unaddressed.  There are two angles to tackling it, namely, the control of substances through the Irish Medicines Board and Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the use of planning laws to put these shops out of business.  Head shops are not subject to any planning restrictions and may be established anywhere.  This issue should be addressed by our invisible Minister, wherever he is.</p>

There are 13 head shops in my constituency, two more than there were last week.  They are doing significant business by selling substances which mimic illegal drugs such as cannabis.  These shops are also mislabelling and misbranding.  The fronts of these shops feature images of cannabis and drugs in the form of heroin or other substances banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  Notwithstanding this, as the ingredients have not been defined in the Act, the Garda cannot use existing legislation to tackle the problem.  The Garda Síochána cannot use existing legislation to tackle this problem.  What we have missed in the past is an early response to a new development that took place with regard to drug abuse.</p>

In September and more recently on 10 December, I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the number of persons imprisoned arising from the provisions of various criminal justice Acts passed by this House in the past year.  No answer was provided, just a vague answer going around in circles in the usual way.  Deputy Joe Costello raised the question of increased criminal activity yesterday morning.  What are the other items of justice legislation, with particular reference to the curtailing of criminal activity, along the lines suggested when the legislation was introduced last summer?  The suggestion was that criminal gang leaders would be put behind bars and put out of action and that law and order would be restored to the country.</p>

Will those other items of legislation, particularly the nurses and midwives Bill on the priority list, be taken before the Bill that will charge medical card patients for their prescriptions?  It is outrageous that the Government can prioritise certain Bills that penalise the poorest and sickest members of our society, but cannot prioritise other Bills that have been on the list for years and are very important in terms of the operation of the health services.

          <p eId="para_382">I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 10 December and Friday, 11 December last.  While some weeks have passed since the meeting took place, it is worthwhile for me to report to the House on the business of the meeting.  It is important that we have this opportunity for statements on the matter.  It was the first meeting of the European Council since the Treaty of Lisbon came into force on 1 December 2009.  Inevitably, it had something of a transitional feel about it.  Nonetheless, it gave us an interesting glimpse into how the European Council will function into the future.  Under the Lisbon treaty, meetings of the European Council should be prepared by the General Affairs Council.  While that did not happen on this occasion, I understand that the General Affairs Council will meet on two occasions to prepare the spring meeting of the European Council, which is scheduled for 25 and 26 March next and will concentrate on economic issues.  The Lisbon treaty also provides that the members of the Council shall be the Heads of State or Government, together with its president and the President of the Commission.  Therefore, Foreign Ministers will not automatically attend, as has normally been the case up to now.  The December meeting followed this new format, with no Ministers present.  Having said that, Ministers may join future meetings depending on the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The Lisbon treaty created the new post of President of the European Council, to which we unanimously elected Mr. Herman Van Rompuy when we met in November.  I have expressed my congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Van Rompuy as he embarks on his new role.  Although he did not chair the December meeting as his full range of functions did not take effect until 1 January last, he joined us to outline his initial views on how he sees his role evolving.  The meeting was instead chaired by the Swedish Prime Minister, Mr. Fredrik Reinfeldt.  As he did throughout the Swedish Presidency, he brought a good mix of common sense and leadership to his role.  He again steered the meeting to a successful conclusion.  I wish to record my appreciation of Mr. Reinfeldt's stewardship of the Council's business during the course of the Swedish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Notwithstanding the changes introduced by the Lisbon treaty, the rotating Presidency of the European Union remains an important element of the Union's architecture.  In this regard, I extend my best wishes to the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Zapatero, as the incoming Spanish Presidency takes up the reins for the coming period.  The new post of President of the European Council logically and inevitably means that Heads of State and Government will no longer chair Council meetings.  It is worth taking a moment to reflect on this change, which has attracted relatively little attention to date.  Many former taoisigh have fulfilled the role of chair of the European Council with great distinction during past Irish Presidencies of the European Union, often at times of huge importance along Europe's journey to peace and economic success.  Their conduct and success as President of the European Council reflect the long and proud tradition of Ireland's membership of and contribution to the Union, since we joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973.  They epitomise in many ways the enthusiasm, support and conviction that Ireland has brought to its membership of the Union.  I will come back to this issue briefly in a few moments.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">A number of important topics were on the agenda at the December meeting of the European Council.  I refer, for example, to some implementation issues arising under the Lisbon treaty, the economic and employment situation, climate change, justice and home affairs issues and external relations.  Our discussion of Lisbon treaty implementation measures included the format of the European Council itself, issues relating to establishment of the European external action service and the need to address anomalies in European Parliament seat allocations arising from the most recent Parliament elections, which preceded the entry into force of the treaty.  I have often stressed the need for Europe to move beyond its long-running preoccupation with institutional issues.  It is time for us to put the spotlight firmly on real issues like jobs and climate change.  This view was unanimously shared at the December meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">While positions varied from country to country during the Council's discussion of economic issues, the general view was that the crisis is stabilising across Europe and we are at the preliminary, if fragile, stages of a recovery.  Nonetheless, many colleagues expressed concern about the growth of unemployment and the social effects that accompany it.  They emphasised the need to focus on maintaining and creating jobs, now that the scale of some of the macroeconomic threats has moderated to an extent.  The Council agreed that trade has an important role to play in stimulating a recovery in jobs and that further work is required to complete the Internal Market and to safeguard against protectionism externally.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">As an economy that is enormously dependent on trade and exports, Ireland shares and welcomes these sentiments.  We discussed the need for the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact to be respected.  During my conversations with my colleagues, there was much interest in the tough but necessary decisions we have taken here, including those announced in last month's budget.  My counterparts and the Commission made it clear that we are resolutely committed to implementing a sustainable and credible fiscal consolidation in very challenging times.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">With an eye to the longer term, the Council had a preliminary discussion on the nature of the successor to the Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth, which will be known as EU 2020.  The President of the Council has called an informal meeting of the European Council for 11 February to discuss economic matters, including an exchange of views on this new and important initiative.  The European Commission has been carrying out a parallel consultation process on EU 2020, prior to the new college of Commissioners presenting formal proposals over the coming weeks.  The Government has contributed to that consultation process.  Discussions and negotiations on this topic will build in the coming months.  The aim is that it will be discussed in detail at the spring meeting of the European Council, with a view to formal adoption by the Council in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Council stressed at the December meeting that fiscal exit strategies need to be implemented within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact.  We also agreed that a co-ordinated approach to unwinding financial supports is necessary and must take account of the need for financial stability and the differentiated situations in member states.  The key work in this area is being done within ECOFIN.  The European Council will receive a further report on fiscal and financial exit strategies in advance of its June meeting.  The European Council also welcomed the good work done at ECOFIN during 2009 on new structures for financial supervision in Europe.  The structures aim to provide greater protection against future bubbles and crises and to enhance stability across Europe.  I share the view that the new regime should become operational this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Climate change was also a major topic at the meeting, not least because we were meeting a week before the culmination of the Copenhagen climate change summit.  During our discussions, which have been somewhat overtaken by the relatively disappointing outcome of the Copenhagen summit, we reached clear agreement within the Union on the global importance of the climate change challenge and the need for the Union to continue to play a leadership role.  We had committed to a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020 and were prepared to increase this to 30% if other key regions made comparable commitments.  At the time of the December Council meeting, there continued to be a slim hope that other key players would commit to comparable targets at Copenhagen.  With the benefit of hindsight, we may have been too optimistic in our assessment of what others might be willing to do.  For our own part, by committing unilaterally to a 20% cut, we went much further than many other key players were and are ready to contemplate.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We also agreed that the Union was prepared to contribute fast-start finance for developing nations amounting to €2.4 billion annually for the years 2010 to 2012.  We saw this as a way for the Union to show good faith and to try to inject a positive dynamic into the negotiations in Copenhagen which, as we were meeting, were beginning to show signs of strain.  Fast-start financing can be a crucial element of a global approach to climate change by helping developing countries to cope with the consequences of climate change and reduce their own emissions from greenhouse gases.  For our part, I agreed that we would contribute up to €100 million over the three year period as our fair share of the Union's efforts.  This represents a major contribution from Ireland, especially in the context of the current budgetary difficulties and the nature of the sacrifices that our people are being asked to make.  The Council also took important steps in a number of other areas, including the Union's sustainable development strategy and inviting the Commission to advance work on the Union's future financial framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">In the justice and home affairs area, we adopted the Stockholm programme, which is a new framework for the years 2010 to 2014.  This is an area of increasing importance to our citizens, who are deeply concerned about cross-border crime, including the trafficking of people and drugs.  The next step is for the Commission to present a work programme to turn this framework into action and this will also be a priority for the Spanish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">On the external relations front, we adopted conclusions on the Eastern Partnership and the Union for the Mediterranean, as well as on Iran and Afghanistan.  These texts were negotiated under the direction of Foreign Ministers and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, can elaborate on them if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The December meeting marks the beginning of a new phase in the working of the European Council which will continue to evolve over coming months, not least as the role of the President of the Council comes into full effect.  The Lisbon treaty aims to make our Union more efficient and effective.  Given the challenges we face, we need Europe to deliver on those aims and the European Council has a key role to play.  As we adjust to new procedures, it is important that we strike the right balance between consultation and action; small and large member states; the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the Parliament and the Commission; and action at European and national, regional or local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Here in Ireland, we must now put the Lisbon treaty referendums behind us and demonstrate that we are enthusiastic and committed players.  A small country does not wield influence by being perceived as half-hearted.  On the contrary, as we have learned and shown in the past, our influence is directly related to our level of commitment and engagement.  It is only by dispelling any residual doubts others might hold about our commitment that we can maximise our influence.  To do this, we must show form.  Often this simply means bringing our own blend of pragmatism and a collaborative approach to bear on EU negotiations.  At other times it means accepting that compromise is the life blood of co-operation between member states and institutions.  Above all, it means maximising our engagement at all levels.  The new Lisbon treaty arrangements require us to step up a gear.  Together with the Minister, Deputy Martin, I am leading work within the Government on improving our overall engagement with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Lisbon also brings important changes to national parliaments, in which regard I welcome the work of the Oireachtas, and particularly the determination of the Joint Committees on European Affairs and European Scrutiny to examine how the Oireachtas can improve how it deals with EU business.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Improving engagement is necessary for our medium to long-term interests, whether that relates to our economic or financial situation, negotiations on the future budget or the priorities of the Union, such as the Common Agriculture Policy.  However, it is also important as we seek understanding of our current situation and the decisions and actions we have to take in the more immediate future.  This goes beyond Government because we all have a role to play.  We need to deepen our engagement with European institutions, strengthen bilateral relations with fellow member states and attach priority to negotiations within the EU not just when laws are being developed, but also in regard to their transposition and enforcement domestically.  Finally, we must ensure that the Irish people have a better understanding and awareness of the European Union, how it operates and how we benefit from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">As we embark on a further stage of the Union's development, the Government is determined to renew our engagement within Europe.  We can only succeed if Europe succeeds and we are determined to play our full part to ensure that it does.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I believe Herman Van Rompuy will do a good job as President of the European Council.  He strikes me as a person with common sense and practical politics which will pay dividends in his new role.  I wish Baroness Catherine Ashton the best of luck as High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs.  She had a difficult time during the hearings but her appointment has now been approved.  The withdrawal of the Bulgarian candidate for Commissioner, Rumiana Jeleva, will probably cause a delay for the spring Council and the European Parliament will have a role play in finalising the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I wish Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn the best of luck as Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science.  Her €50 billion budget for research and innovation will be of particular importance for this country.  While Commissioners do not strictly act in national interests, a real opportunity exists for our small country to achieve world leadership in a number of niches.  We will see immense changes globally over the next ten years as the internet, robotics and biotechnology impact on the way we do business.  We will have to ride that wave before it hits our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs is relieved that he no longer has to attend every Council meeting.  Mr. Van Rompuy sees the economy as the big issue for his Presidency and wants to double the EU's growth rate from 1% to 2%.  He also regards climate change and energy as priorities.  Irrespective of our political differences, we clearly see opportunities for this country.  Things are becoming ropy in the United States and Mr. Cameron's intention to be the next UK Prime Minister will mean a change of emphasis in that country.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">We must concentrate our efforts on reducing competitive costs and increasing exports by availing of new market opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In preparing for the 2020 strategy, we should consider what structure the Joint Committee on European Affairs should take.  The Government also needs to address the problem that faces the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny in regard to the lack of storage space for material coming from Europe.  When legislation comes from the EU, we will be notified nine weeks in advance and we will need to get our act together if we are to be able to call officials before they go to Brussels and assess what they are going to say.  This will be important given the consequences directives have on various sectors of Irish society.  A river of European legislation has flowed here without proper scrutiny because we have lacked capacity, despite the fact that officials have to give their consent in Brussels before directives are passed.  I am aware the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs has an interest in addressing this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The target set by the Union of a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020, to be increased to 30% if other nations agreed, will not now be met.  This still leaves us with a unique opportunity.  If somebody told the Taoiseach that an oil well with vast potential was discovered in County Offaly, he would want it to be exploited for the benefit of the economy and our people.  However, we have not adequately tapped into the equally vast potential that blows along our north and west coasts on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">We have not addressed the issue of European funds available in the context of Community support for major projects.  In order to deal with the grid system, for example, we must have Community approval for the high tension lines that will be required in many areas.  Otherwise, no matter how much we talk about it, it will not work if we cannot plug it in.  That is a significant problem which we are all concerned to tackle.  The December meeting was important and the Spring Council will be equally important.  We will be pleased to support the Minister in any way we can at European level, through our involvement in the European People's Party, to ensure those structures are in place for the future.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I understand the issue of development aid has been deferred to next June's Council meeting, but events in Haiti overshadowed the meeting of Development Ministers that took place last week.  Will the Minister discuss with his European colleagues the possibility of sending a European Union battle group to Haiti in the context of the United Nations Secretary General's request for additional assistance?  In the run up to the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the emphasis in discussions on the battle groups was in the context of Iraq or another military offensive.  The reality is that these groups have an important humanitarian role to play.  A force of 1,500, available to move within 15 days, self-sustaining for 30 days and which can be resupplied for 120 days is an important resource.  I understand Ireland is not on standby again until the first half of 2011.  The battle groups have preordained command and control structures in place and are able to operate independently.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The Minister and his colleagues must examine the degree of effectiveness of co-ordination efforts in the aftermath of national and international disasters.  Such operations always seems to be very slow to get up and running.  I appreciate that in disaster situations such as that in Haiti communications may be down and infrastructure damaged, making efforts to assist more difficult.  However, we must be sure to learn from previous mistakes so that co-ordination and relief efforts can become more streamlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">At December's Council meeting the Stockholm programme 2010-2014 was discussed, with its laudable objective of an open and secure Europe.  However, as we saw from the incident in the United States on Christmas Day, we cannot afford to neglect the importance of security.  The Minister must liaise with the Minister for Transport to ensure that whatever mechanisms are necessary are in place in our airports, including body scanners and so on, so that we do not become an easy means of passage for terrorist attacks on United States aircraft in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">In regard to external relations, the Taoiseach did not refer to it in his speech but I understand there was a Swedish initiative to examine a proposal to ordain east Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.  Will the Minister comment on the Government's position on this issue and why the initiative ran into the sand?</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Submissions must be made in the coming weeks regarding the citizens' initiative.  This process must be made as flexible as possible, requiring perhaps one quarter of member states and in the region of 0.2% of the population, as recommended by the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  This would mean that some 9,000 signatures would be required in Ireland.  Petitioners should have up to one year to gather the necessary information after which the Commission would have to act on it within six months.  I note the difference of opinion between the Parliament and the Commission as to how this should be done.  What is most important is that it should be as flexible as possible.  With regard to the mechanism that should be in place to facilitate the process, it is more difficult to come up with a proposal to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The European Union's 2020 strategy concentrates on economic matters, including sustainable public finances.  There is also a commitment to a 20% reduction in 1990 emission levels by 2020.  The possibility of achieving a 30% reduction should be pursued in the future, difficult as it may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Also in the context of the 2020 strategy, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, the importance of ensuring a standard approach across member states when it comes to measuring numeracy and literacy.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, as a former Minister for Education and Science should be aware that, regrettably and despite claims to the contrary, we do not have the best education system in the world.  There are many shortcomings at primary level in particular.  We pride ourselves on our position as a gateway to Europe, as an English language-speaking country which is able to attract investment from United States companies.  However, global economics have moved on.  We must consider introducing Chinese language tuition in schools, in addition to French and German.  Being the only English-speaking member state in the eurozone is no longer adequate because many people throughout the Continent can speak English.  It is no longer a competitive advantage.  Chinese language tuition should be introduced in schools, and that proposal should be included in our submission on the 2020 strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I echo the point made by Deputy Timmins regarding the deployment of a European Union battle group in Haiti.  The Deputy always talks sense and this is an excellent and logical suggestion which the Government and the Commission should put forward via the Council.  We must ensure we have the maximum impact in terms of saving lives and reducing the humanitarian disaster occurring in that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Will the Minister clarify an issue I raised with him before Christmas in regard to Ireland's commitment to assist developing countries in tackling climate change?  The Taoiseach referred in his speech to the €100 million that has been committed for this purpose.  Will the Minister clarify whether this sum will come from the Ireland Aid budget?  Aid agencies deserve clarity in terms of their budgeting efforts for the year ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Another important initiative that is clearly highlighted in the Council conclusions is the European external action service.  This offers an important opportunity for the European Union to represent itself across the globe but also for Ireland to promote our diplomatic corps and its skills.  I hope efforts are under way within Iveagh House and within Government to seek ways to encourage young Irish people to join the Department of Foreign Affairs.  However, while it is important that we are well integrated into the new European external action service, it should not in any way supplant the Irish foreign service and the excellent work done by our embassy staff and diplomatic corps on behalf of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, outlined the key elements of the 2010 strategy at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs.  There was a strong view among committee members that this strategy presents an excellent opportunity to develop a ten-year plan for the future of the European economy.  From an Irish point of view, it is desirable that emphasis be put on job protection and creation.  An important element of that, as pointed out by many committee members, was to place some focus on manufacturing.  As we have become almost obsessed with the concept of a smart economy, we have to some extent turned away from and neglected the manufacturing industry.  The strategy represents a major opportunity for investment in infrastructure.  In Ireland broadband is the key area in which that investment is required, and the 2020 strategy is an important part of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The citizens' initiative is being taken very seriously by the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs under the chairmanship of Deputy Durkan.  The matter will be discussed at next Friday's meeting of the committee, which will be attended by MEPs, and we intend to open up that discussion to the public.  It is an extremely important opportunity for the European Union to show, prove and demonstrate that it is trying hard to connect with its citizens and to open up the European Union for them.  The initiative was almost dismissed during the campaign on the Lisbon treaty referendum by many on the "No" side who said that it was just a tokenistic gesture.  I am pleased that it is being advanced so quickly by the Government and by the European Council.  I hope we can ensure that it works by putting in place a clearly functioning system.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_421">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the most recent European Council meeting on 10 and 11 December 2009.  It was the first Council meeting since the Lisbon treaty came into force and it began the process of putting in place the nuts and bolts that were required under the treaty, initially with the two somewhat unknown incumbents, Herman Van Rompuy, who filled the new office of President of the European Council, and the equally unknown but rather distinguished sounding Baroness Ashton, who filled the position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">A report appears in today's newspaper indicating that the baroness decided not to go to Haiti to see for herself the effects of the earthquake there.  That was the wrong decision.  This is the first time we have had a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  We see on the television and hear on the airwaves every night about the President of the United States and the previous President of the United States who is in Haiti currently, and see how the United States is claiming for itself a huge profile in the response to the Haiti disaster.  At the same time, we are the largest donors of aid globally.  It seems to me that we are adopting the same position that we have adopted towards the Middle East in the context of the European Union, that we are providing most of the resources and aid, as we are doing in the Middle East, but we are not in any way claiming the kudos, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The European Union is not projecting itself forward in the way that it should.  In terms of perception, it should be seen as being central to dealing with the problems created by the earthquake and the huge human disaster that exists rather than allowing the United States to continue to present itself as the only serious, caring political entity in regard to Haiti.  Nevertheless, I wish both of those new appointees well.  I hope they will distinguish themselves in their new appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The next item to which the Council referred was the European external action service.  It has signalled its intention to adopt the proposals relating to the organisation and functioning of the European external action service by April of this year and that member states would get involved in that process.  We have precious little information on how that work is progressing.  What input is coming from this country on the matter?  What bodies are involved in developing the European external action service in terms of its organisation and future functioning, personnel, resources and locations?  What impact will that have on our diplomatic service in terms of its location, personnel, careers and the parameters of the service?  It would be worthwhile if we could have a discussion in this House or if the Minister could present some paper to us on the nuts and bolts of what has happened to date and what input might be made by a broader consultation process than seems to be the case at present.  This House would benefit from a full briefing on the European external action service and its organisation before the deadline of April 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I was disappointed that the Taoiseach did not mention the European citizens' initiative in his contribution even though he referred to the fact that together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, he is leading work within Government to improve our overall engagement with the European Union.  He also stated that it is necessary to improve engagement right across the board.  One of the great problems with the European Union is engagement with it.  That is one of the great complaints one hears around the country and in other members states, namely, that is difficult to see how ordinary people can engage with the European Union.  The citizens' initiative is tailored precisely to allow power to the people, and to enable the ordinary citizen to put an item of concern directly on the agenda of the Commission, to bypass the normal bureaucratic processes, institutional bureaucracy, red tape and to be able to use a new mechanism to get an issue straight onto the agenda of the Commission and for it to be dealt with in a serious fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">That is our first test.  How did we respond to it?  I have not seen the Government respond to it by going out to the highways and byways and consulting widely with the citizenry.  I have not seen the Government availing of all the communications mechanisms, including electronic methods, newspapers, advertising, television and radio to inform the citizen.  Scarcely a citizen in the country is aware of the new rights that are being conferred on him or her.  Where is the sense in talking about awareness, consultation and engagement unless we do it when we can do it and when we have something beneficial to sell to or tell the citizen such as the fact that a mechanism exists that would allow him or her to be directly involved in the decision making of the European Union?  We have not done that.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">As Deputy Lucinda Creighton said, the only thing that has been done to date has been done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which is carrying out a minimal amount of advertising in newspapers in order to reach the public at large.  There is no sense in us having a plethora of meetings about collective stakeholders, holding a few conferences here and there and talking to each other about it; we should be engaging in a direct awareness and consultation mechanism.  Although time will be limited in terms of getting that together, given that our proposals have to be in by the end of the month and the new structure is to be in place by June, I would like to see work done in that regard.  It is something that we could usefully discuss in the House and communicate to a wider audience if that could be managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The fiscal exit strategy is a work of fiction.  I cannot imagine what the intention was in the context of this country when the matter was being discussed.  That is one of the most important aspects of the meeting in the context of the economy.  Reference was made to exiting from the broad-based stimulus policies.  We, in this country, have nothing to exit from.  We have no broad-based stimulus policies.  We have no stimulus policies at all.  We have not been part of the European recovery plan.  It was stated that member states "should begin to unwind financial support schemes".  It was also stated that there should be "adequate incentives for financial institutions to cease to depend on public financial support".  It was indicated that the phasing out of support should start with government guarantees.  Those quotations are from the final report of the European Commission.  In the context of government guarantees, the Taoiseach must have thought he was on another planet when that was being debated.  I cannot see how he could have agreed to something of that nature when we are in the process of putting a package together.  We have State guarantees, recapitalisation, NAMA and further recapitalisation will be required.  We are way out of kilter with what is happening in the vast majority of members of the EU.  When the review of that fiscal exit strategy takes place in June, we will be seen to have moved further and further away from the position to which the other member states have moved because they have moved on to growth and jobs and the banking systems in those countries will have become independent and able to stand on their own two feet.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Our mollycoddling of the banks is clearly frowned upon by our EU partners.  This is at loggerheads with what the Taoiseach said in the House this morning, namely, that the systems that have been put in place are approved by the EU and the European institutions, which is clearly not the case.  They are telling us to get out of it as quickly as possible, to get rid of State financial guarantees as the first step and to unwind state support.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_431">That may well be.  However, this is the whole approach to it.  The next step the Commission moves on to is the regulation of the financial markets, all of which is an integral part of the same package.  We have discussed at the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny the de Larosière report and we have made considerable contributions to that report in terms of its drafting.  Again, this is something the scrutiny committee has requested would be put on the floor of the House for debate.  The new regulatory mechanisms are very worthwhile — that is an EU initiative — and it is essential that they be put in place to give confidence in, and to regulate and supervise, the marketplace, as well as to restore confidence in the financial institutions and to ensure that the cowboys who were operating in the past and have brought the whole banking system to such a sorry state are reined in once and for all.  We would like to see a debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The new EU 2020 strategy is probably the most important factor of all in terms of an economic way forward.  This is the second half of the Lisbon strategy that began in 2000 with a very ambitious programme of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world.  Unfortunately, it concentrated on unregulated financial and economic development rather than sustainable growth and economic development which would be tempered by a commitment to a social agenda.  As a result, we have found ourselves bogged down for a number of years and not going anywhere.  It is important that the situation be reviewed and that more coherent, streamlined and focused structures be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">In that context, I welcome the appointment of Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn as our new Commissioner and I welcome the portfolio she has received, namely, the area of research and innovation.  We should be able to build around that quite a good approach in regard to sustainable growth and employment, particularly in the areas of alternative energy and the smart economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Employment and the social agenda must be at the heart of the next ten-year strategy.  As Deputy Timmins noted, there is concern at the way we have moved forward in the past.  The emphasis has been very much on globalisation and the quantity of production, with the world as the marketplace.  There has to be a greater focus on the quality of the marketplace and the quality of the product, including local and regional products and craft products which are more indigenous and are, therefore, likely to have a more long-term base and not just disappear to somewhere else in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The credit squeeze has become endemic in this country.  It has prevented the indigenous market from expanding and moving forward, and has made it stagnant over the past couple of years.  While this must be dealt with, there is no sign of it being dealt with here, whereas it is being dealt with in Europe.  Small companies still have no access to a regular credit flow, which must be a major part of the new 2020 strategy regarding cash flow for companies, which are the lifeblood of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I would have liked to deal with other issues such as the Copenhagen conference and the huge amount of work which remains to be done in regard to the Lisbon treaty, which must be teased out.  This country must take serious decisions also.  The Taoiseach referred to how we transpose into domestic legislation EU directives and we must address this issue.  I have seen very important issues, such as the services directive and the floods directive, being transposed by statutory instrument without Members having considered them in the House and without any of the normal democratic legislative processes being used.  We must change this in the interests of democracy.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_437">Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an deis seo againn labhairt ar an gcheist seo chomh luath sa bhliain.  Agus muid ag dul chun tosaigh sa tír seo, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeimid ag plé na ceisteanna atá ardaithe ag Comhairle na hEorpa.  Tá sé tábhachtach freisin nach bhfuil conclúidí nó treoracha Comhairle na hEorpa ag teacht salach ar an méid atá an tír seo ag iarraidh a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I expected that the first Council meeting following the entry into force of the latest treaty, the Lisbon treaty, would be a brave and decisive step forward for the EU because that is what we were promised.  We expected that the meeting would have a lot of energy and enthusiasm but, regretfully, I did not see that enthusiasm.  Perhaps it will come in future Council meetings, although I doubt it.  Indeed, the Presidency conclusions said as much in the opening line, which read "The new Treaty of Lisbon will allow the Union to fully concentrate on addressing the challenges ahead", and major challenges they are.  When I settled down to examine what those conclusions were, I hoped to see some major initiatives regarding how jobs and recovery would be tackled and what was being promised from the EU.  To my surprise, however, the priority issues related to the Lisbon treaty were the setting up of the European external action service and the legislation on the citizens initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Members should not get me wrong.  These issues need to be discussed.  The citizens initiative, in particular, is laudable and, hopefully, it will be rolled out properly and given proper teeth so the Commission will not be able to wriggle out of proposing positive and progressive measures, as it has avoided them to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">We also need to have a proper discussion in regard to where the European external action service is going and what is the end game in that regard.  I have noticed already that some of the European Foreign Ministers are looking for it to go well beyond what was proposed or predicted.  They are looking for Europe to be represented by a single member at the UN.  As a neutral country, we obviously need to ensure that the European external action service is not subordinated to the political or military imperatives of NATO.  It is a duty for those of us in the House, as issues arise in regard to that service, to ensure that it does not go to where it potentially could go, and to where some European member states wish it to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">We must consider the area of justice and home affairs.  This was highlighted at the Council meeting as a key priority.  Closer examination reveals that the priority in the field of justice and home affairs is an intention to make full use of Article 222.  We should remind ourselves that the article allows the European Union to mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including military resources made available by member states to prevent terrorist threats in the territory of the member states, to protect democratic institutions and civilian populations from any terrorist attack and to assist the member state in its territory at the request of political authorities in the event of a terrorist attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">That is quite clear.  The problem I have at this stage is that the same priority and mobilisation of instruments is not being used in tackling poverty or inequality in the European Union.  I was hoping for some kind of statement at the meeting indicating that the instruments would be used to build for a jobs recovery, which is not prioritised as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">What was the conclusion on jobs and recovery?  It was stated that the economic position is starting to show signs of stabilisation and confidence is increasing, which we have heard before.  We heard it last October when the Council stated that the sharp decline in the European economy was coming to a halt with a stabilisation of financial markets and improvement in confidence.  That has not been seen.  When we come back in March or April there will be a similar statement with the idea that if it is repeated three times, it must be true despite the devastation being visited on jobs, income and services in this country and across many EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The conclusion also stated that uncertainties and frailties remain and the employment and social situation is expected to deteriorate in 2010.  There is a slight contradiction in the statement in saying that there is stabilisation in the financial market with an end to its decline as further on it deals with deterioration.  The economy is stabilising but the jobs position is not.  It has been indicated that there will be further job losses and the social elements will deteriorate again this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">What kind of recovery will this be if the employment and social issues deteriorate again?  The Government has shown in its recent budget that it has all the required skills to bring about further deterioration in the employment and social spheres.  The October Council meeting also expected a deterioration in employment and it was more proactive in trying to ensure that action would be taken to increase employment, as well as promoting active social inclusion and protection policies.  There are different emphases and nuances in the December meeting, which did not have the same positive outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The conclusions also stated that policies in support of the economy should remain in place and only be withdrawn when recovery is fully secured.  Will the Minister indicate which policies are being referred to?  Are they policies dealing with weak regulation, the liberalisation of public services, the race to the bottom for workers' pay and conditions or the attack on social welfare payments?  Which policy should remain?</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Some of the details of the SR Technics issue are still emerging.  Do we want to promote such a model, or such as we saw with Dell, in the European Union?  SR Technics, a profitable company in Dublin, employed approximately 1,200 or 1,300 workers.  However, an EU member state invested in hangars to successfully draw those jobs away from Ireland.  This company still has not fully paid its part of the pension fund of those workers, where there is a deficit of €26 million.  Is that the sort of Europe we want to promote with regard to employment policies?</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Maltese have suggested that €1.6 billion in revenue streams will be created by attracting SR Technics away from Ireland.  The loss to the Irish economy is not only in jobs, but also in revenue streams.  We must not concentrate just on the Maltese as the Polish did the exact same with Dell.  There is nothing to protect Ireland from losing further jobs to countries where the governments have interfered in the market.  I asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if she would nationalise the company or give additional supports to try to hold SR Technics here, but she said she would not interfere with the market because it is against EU rules.  The Maltese and Polish have done so and Ireland must suffer the consequences.  Perhaps that is because we are on the periphery or such a small country, although Malta is much smaller.  We could not ensure that SR Technics would remain in the country.  Perhaps that is the type of building and support for the economy that the European Union speaks about.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">There are some positives in the conclusions, from which the Government, in particular, can learn.  It can recognise the weaknesses of the current regulatory framework and the supervisory arrangements for financial institutions, which were mentioned in the conclusions.  It was stated that remuneration policies within the financial sector must promote sound and effective risk management and should contribute to the prevention of further crises in the economy.  The importance of renewing the economic and social contract between financial institutions, along with the society they serve, was emphasised.  Is the council suggesting that we move towards state banks in indicating that the importance of renewing the economic and social contract between financial institutions and the society they serve?  One way to do this is to ensure that financial institutions serve society rather than lining the pockets of their directors and shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The new EU 2020 strategy has the potential to bring about a new vision to replace the tired and failed Lisbon strategy and that opportunity must be grasped. This relates to my earlier point about job losses in Dell and SR Technics.  The undermining of employment in a member state by a company, which undermines, interferes, break the rules and causes job losses in another member state, cannot be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">A recognition of the benefits of having a greener economy is important.  Energy efficiency can help businesses lower costs, it can help less well off families out of fuel poverty and can help combat climate change.  A shift to an energy efficient economy can help economic growth but this needs to be supported, promoted and encouraged much more, perhaps through grant aiding companies.  However, the positive nature of this and other points will depend on the detail of how the Commission proposes to take them forward.  It is welcome that one of the key positions in the Commission is held by an Irish woman, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  Hopefully, she will be able to encourage the Government to invest in research and in education in particular.  If one does not invest in education, one cannot build an economy based on research and innovation or build a knowledge-based economy.  That is one of the key lessons the Government, based on its recent budget, has not learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">It is important that the EU does not repeat the mistake of the Lisbon strategy.  If we are to genuinely develop a new vision and direction for EU policy, as the Commission states in its consultation document, the EU 2020 strategy, there will be a need to focus on a green economy, empowering communities and on unleashing the social and economic potential of vulnerable groups in our society.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">A number of questions were raised by Members and it might be appropriate for the Minister to deal with those first before taking additional questions.  I call the Minister to deal with those matters.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_454">That is useful.  I thank Members for their wide-ranging contributions.  In terms of the comments made by Deputy Timmins on Haiti and by other the colleagues in the House, we will discuss this situation in greater detail tomorrow.  However, I take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathies and extend our heartfelt condolences to the people of Haiti and to all those affected by the earthquake and the aftermath of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Members raised the issue of co-ordination and the need for a swift response.  The response from the international community has been swift but it has been hampered by logistics on the ground, infrastructural deficiencies and so forth.  At the emergency meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Council this week, which was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, the EU pledged €122 million for immediate humanitarian effort and a further €300 million will be directed from EU instruments to finance the longer term response of recovery and reconstruction.  The European Union has called for an international conference on the reconstruction of Haiti.  Ireland has pledged €2 million in funding for the relief operation.  That is in addition to the €20 million we have already allocated to the United Nations emergency relief fund.  We are one of the largest contributors to that fund.  The idea of establishing that fund was to have money in place in anticipation of a catastrophe of this kind.  We, along with other members states of the UN pushed for that following the tsunami that occurred a few years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">On Monday we dispatched 83 metric tonnes of essential humanitarian supplies to Haiti.  Irish Aid is working closely with Concern, GOAL and the other NGOs to get emergency materials on the ground.  Two members of Irish Aid's rapid response corps have been deployed to assist the World Food Programme.  A third member will travel within the next week to assist GOAL in its response and others remain on stand-by.  That response corps comprises people with specific skills.  We are waiting for the UN and others to indicate that they need a particular expert or a person in a particular discipline in an area where there are gaps.  That is the context within which people would come forward.  It is expected that experts in logistics, telecommunications, child protection are likely to be called upon by the UN and other humanitarian organisations over the coming days and weeks.  An Irish Aid technical team has left for Haiti to assess the short and medium needs and how Ireland can contribute to the relief operation.  The Irish people have demonstrated their generosity in supporting appeals from a range of NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">On the battle group question, Council conclusion 5 states that: "The EU and its Member States stand ready to provide additional assistance on the basis of the ongoing needs assessment, including military and civil assets, as appropriate, responding to the UN request."  A key point — this also relates to the context of what we are doing here — is that the more we can channel via one source, the more we can create a coherent, concerted, focused effort.  I have some concern with the plethora of agencies and people who have come forward.  Approximately seven organisations with different account numbers were shown on a news broadcast the other night.  My view is that we need to concentrate our efforts and make sure everybody works.  That is happening so far and Irish Aid is co-ordinating the humanitarian relief effort among our NGOs and focusing on people with experience on the ground.  We had three partners, in particular, in Haiti prior to the disaster, namely, Concern, Christian Aid and Médecins Sans Frontières.  The situation there is appalling and we will do whatever we can to support the people there.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I sense that the logistical human resource issue is the key one.   I would not necessarily accept what Deputy Costello said about the high representative, Catherine Ashton.  I accept her bona fides in the sense that the key issue is the nature of the response.  If every significant figure wanted to fly into Haiti, that would clog up the airport.  It is not about being to seen to be doing something.  In a humanitarian crisis, we just do the work.  I am not interested in earning kudos nor should the Deputy be.  That is not the key issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">In terms of the Stockholm Programme, different perspectives were outlined by Deputy Timmins and Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I accept Deputy Timmins's view that we have to be ready and make sure that we are up to speed in terms of having body scanners and all the various instruments we need.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has key responsibilities in that area and is keen to ensure those are in place.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised various issues concerning military and security matters in the event of a terrorist attack here.  We have protocols in that regard and we can opt in and opt out, but the bottom-line is that if a major terrorist attack occurred here, I would welcome assistance as I believe the country would.  We need to examine these issues and take account of the big picture, particularly humanitarian or other civil support a country would offer, in the way we offer humanitarian and civil support to other countries that have been the subject of attack.  After all, we are members of the European Union. We talk about the situation in Haiti and about other horrific events that have happened across the world and we always stand ready to support countries in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The citizens' initiative was raised.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche attended a meeting in Spain last week, at which this issue was significantly dealt with.  We would be broadly in line with what members have said on this issue.  It was suggested that about a quarter of member states be the figure and not a third.  We would share Deputy Timmins's view on that.  It is suggested that the threshold in each member state would be 0.2%, as the Dáil committee suggested.  Ireland has put forward a view that petitioners should be on the voting register to facilitate checking for fraud, to make sure that the petitioners are genuine and that the signatories are valid.  If petitions are made on-line, which they probably will be, precautions need to be taken in terms of fundraising; the initiative should not be used as fundraising mechanism.  During the Lisbon treaty debate, this was one of the points we trumpeted as a key advantage for people to vote "Yes" for the treaty.  We would be interested in working through that with Members of the House to make sure that our citizens are fully aware of the opportunities the citizens' initiative creates for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The template that will emerge to facilitate the citizen's initiative is the ideal one to disseminate across the country and of which to make people aware.  We are anxious to do that.  We have already had some good experience in our work in this area with <i>eumatters.ie</i> and other websites we used during the Lisbon campaign.  The <i>eumatters.ie</i> contained information on Europe.  The communicating Europe initiative showed that on-line facilities can be useful in terms of imparting information to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The European External Action Service was mentioned.  It is early days yet but we are anxious, in line with what Members said, that there be Irish participation, that the service reflects the broad range of interests and perspectives that is the European Union and that small states have adequate representation on the staff, including the secondment of some of our diplomats.  We are interested in this because we want to ensure, as the Taoiseach said earlier, that our influence is strong and positive.  There is work to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The job creation strategy is key, and the 2020 strategy — the successor to the Lisbon strategy — is also important.  The Irish position is to try to maintain the central focus on job creation and growth.  There will always be a danger that such strategies, when applied to a 27-country bloc, can become spread out, with a range of different strands and issues being dealt with and diluting the central focus of the strategy.  For Ireland and across Europe, the focus must be jobs and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I am cautious about Deputy Ó Snodaigh's final remarks.  You win some and you lose some, but we have always argued for a more liberal State aid regime in Ireland; in fact, it was the hallmark of our policy for 20 or 30 years and we succeeded in attracting many multinational investors.  One of the fundamental reasons we have preserved our autonomy on taxation is that our policy of corporate taxation has been key to attracting inward investment.  We may lose some to other emerging countries, but we must be careful that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water and undermine a key feature of our industrialisation policy for more than 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I have not covered all of the issues mentioned as Members may want to ask further questions.  Deputy Timmins mentioned the Middle East and the possibility of a two-state solution.  We are happy with the conclusions that emerged from the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council itself, which called for an urgent resumption of negotiations that will lead, within an agreed timeline, to a two-state solution with the State of Israel and an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable state of Palestine living side-by-side in peace and security.  Paragraph 2 of the Foreign Affairs Council's conclusions states: "The European Union will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties."  This is an important aspect of the conclusions decided upon at the meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">I thank the Minister for his response and wish to take him up on one issue — namely, the advertisements from different agencies seeking money for Haiti.  Aid agencies might dispute this as a simplistic approach, but would the Minister agree that there may be merit in aid agencies concentrating on individual geographical areas rather than different subjects or concepts?  If we had one aid agency dealing with each country, it would be so much easier to manage.  Perhaps that is impossible to achieve.  Even here we have a plethora of organisations, including three of four farming organisations.  However, such a system would be easier to administer and allow for the development of greater expertise and for economies of scale.  Whenever something happens there are seven or eight different aid agencies trying to help.  Perhaps this is a utopian ideal that is not possible to achieve, but I would like to hear the Minister's view on whether we should aspire to a situation in which aid agencies concentrate on certain programme countries rather than having smaller operations in many different countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I mentioned that certain countries sought kudos in the context of the disaster in Haiti.  Others seek kudos and many international organisations are using the opportunity to promote themselves.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Timmins said.  We are in contact with two agencies, Christian Aid and Concern, yet neither of those was the first to come looking for funds for Haiti or to present themselves as knowing all about the situation there.  We need to consider that side of things.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The European Union is the largest global donor in the world, sending around €400 million — close to half a billion euro — in aid to Haiti.  Nevertheless, the perception among the public is that the EU is doing scarcely anything and that everything is being done by the United States and by the NGOs.  Because of its self-effacement and modesty, the EU is not playing the necessary role as a leader of the humanitarian work that needs to be done after this terrible tragedy.  That was the point I was making: not that the European Union should seek kudos per se, but that it is allowing others to do so.  The EU should be out in front showing leadership.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_473">I agree with Deputy Timmins.  In fact, I have already suggested such a system to Irish Aid.  It is difficult because it is a free world and any agency can say it wants to provide assistance.  However, in a major catastrophe such as this there should be one fund — in this case, one Haiti trust fund — to which people can contribute, perhaps with Irish Aid deciding how the money is deployed by various agencies that have track records and expertise to offer.  The key issue in emergency relief is that everyone wants to offer help.  There is a genuine outpouring which we do not want to suppress.  However, we need targeted, high-quality intervention that makes a difference.  That is something we need to work on.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">After a disaster of the type that occurred in Haiti, which was on an appalling scale, the public needs to know there is one fund to which they can contribute in addition to what the Government may contribute through Irish Aid, and everybody must co-ordinate resources.  It should be possible to do this; perhaps, as a policy initiative from the Oireachtas, we should put that view forward.  We need to make sure there is less duplication and overlap and that people pull together.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">Yes.  I take the Deputy's point.  There is one airport in Haiti which, as we know, is severely limited in use.  There is a genuine effort all around and everyone, including President Obama, the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, and the European Union, has come together to deal with the disaster as quickly and effectively as possible.  What is important is to deal with the immediate circumstances and then to ensure effort is sustained over a longer period.  If anything is to come out of this there must be a prolonged international effort to ensure we do something lasting and sustainable for Haiti and its people.  Haiti's poverty levels, poor infrastructure and governance issues are all contributing factors to the number of deaths and horrific injuries.  That is what we need to concentrate on at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">I will mention some items not covered by the Taoiseach in his opening speech, namely the conclusions on Iran and Afghanistan, which I will share with Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Following prior agreement at the Foreign Affairs Council on 8 December, the European Council approved a declaration on Iran which called for a diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear question, set out the European Union's grave concerns regarding Iran's persistent failure to meet its international obligations and urged Iran to co-operate with the IAEA.  The declaration also addressed the human rights situation in the country as well as the position of the British Embassy staff and that of Ms Clotilde Reiss, a French national who has been detained.  The situation in Iran remains tense in the wake of the regime's hardline response to the Ashura protests of 27 December, which has led to at least eight deaths — although unofficially the figure is judged to be significantly higher — and hundreds if not thousands of people being detained, which is overwhelming the already crowded prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The regime has again blamed outside interference for the protests and has intensified its campaign against what it represents as foreign enemies.  The United States has described as absurd Iran's claim that it was behind a car bomb that killed an Iranian nuclear scientist in Tehran last week.  The tension has been heightened by calls in the Iranian Parliament for the swift execution of all those guilty of what was claimed to be opposition to the regime.  The response to the Ashura protests and its aftermath, which was roundly condemned by President Obama in the E3, regrettably reduces the potential for the outreach by the United States to Iran.  The E3+3 Geneva dialogue, which had held out some promise, now effectively is stalled and attention has turned to the second track, namely, the possibility of securing a resolution providing for increased sanctions against Iran at the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">While the Heads of State or Government did not discuss Afghanistan at the European Council, it was thought to be the right time to issue a declaration in response to the major policy statement made on Afghanistan by President Obama on 1 December.  In its declaration, the Council reiterated the strong commitment of the European Union to promoting stability and development in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  The Council also welcomed President Obama's policy statement.  The priority needs for the country include the Afghanisation of security, policing and reconstruction operations.  This will require concerted efforts to strengthen Afghan capacity.  The Council also is clear that corruption must be tackled and governance improved.  The European Union is firmly committed to raising human rights standards and, in particular, to improving the role of women in Afghan society.  The option of trying to attract Taliban members who are prepared to renounce violence back into the political and social mainstream also is worth pursuing.  An international conference on Afghanistan will be held in London on 20 January at which I will represent the Government.  It will set out the steps that must be taken by the Government of Afghanistan and its international partners to turn around the situation in that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">On the Oireachtas response to the Lisbon treaty's clauses relating to parliamentary scrutiny, decisions on the best type of instrument and mechanism to be developed in Ireland must come from the Oireachtas because this matter primarily and specifically relates to the Oireachtas.  However, Members on this side of the House stand ready to help in any way they can.</p>

         the number of promotions by rank and appointment that have occurred within the Defence Forces since he announced on 24 November 2009 that he had received sanction for 50 promotions within the Defence Forces; if all 50 promotions have taken place; if not, the reason; the date by which the promotions will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_486">Resulting from the Government decision regarding the reduction in public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, recruitment, promotions and acting up appointments in the Permanent Defence Forces were suspended.  I made a submission to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in June 2009 regarding the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force.  My focus is on maintaining the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces and, therefore, the question of limited exceptions to the application of the measures arises in this regard.  I outlined the need for limited recruitment, promotions and acting appointments for the Defence Forces in my submission to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_487">As I announced on the 24 November, an allocation of 50 promotions was approved for the Permanent Defence Force by the Minister for Finance.  These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements of the Permanent Defence Force.  These promotions, therefore, must be allocated in a manner that gives protection to the operational capacity of the Defence Forces.  In addition, the allocation must be balanced across both officer and enlisted ranks having regard to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  Military management has been reviewing existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.  Following the military review, a number of priority posts have been identified and I am pleased to confirm that nine officer promotions and 27 enlisted promotions have been progressed.  Some have been completed and the remainder will be completed in the coming days.  A number of senior technical officer vacancies also have to be filled and competitions are being organised to fill these posts.  The residual approved promotions will be used to fill priority posts arising in the next few months.  In addition, approximately 30 vacancies will be filled through acting up appointments in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">My officials are continuing to engage with the military authorities regarding the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Defence Forces in light of the Government decision to maintain a complement of 10,000 personnel.  I am glad that, while these are challenging times, the Defence Forces have risen to the challenge and are organised, equipped and staffed in a manner which will ensure they can continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">I read the Minister's reply earlier in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and it demeans the House that he made this information available to that newspaper before announcing it in the House.  Does this imply that if I had not tabled the question today, he would not have made this decision?  He announced 50 promotions at the RACO conference in Cavan three months ago. The members involved were listed and are awaiting promotion.  Why did it take three months to make this announcement?  The Minister announced only 40 promotions.  What is the timeframe for the remaining ten promotions?  He indicated that will depend on urgency and priority.  How long will this take?  Acting up is not the same as being promoted, as it is only a temporary measure.  Will the Minister confirm when the remaining ten promotions will be made?  Why did it take three months for these appointments to be announced since the individuals had been identified, approved and were ready?  Why did we have to read this announcement in today’s newspaper prior to the Minister replying to this question in the House?  Surely he could have waited until he replied in the House to tell the newspaper.</p>

This does nothing for the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">The article states there will be 30 acting up vacancies and this will be a temporary measure.  Could the number of vacancies be increased?  There are many structural problems in the Army.  The Defence Forces are based on chain of command and these vacancies create a health and safety issue, according to responsible members of the force with whom I have been in contact.  I keep in constant contact with RACO, PDFORRA and RDFRA and I know what is happening in the Defence Forces and the Minister cannot say I do not.  However, I refer to the command structure within the Defence Forces and vacant positions being filled by people of a lesser rank.  Surely this raises a health and safety issue.  Has the Minister examined this?  Has he also examined the issue of officers and others leaving the Defence Forces before their time is up, which is also a health and safety issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_516">With regard to the health and safety issues, the military authorities say the Army is fit for purpose.  Certainly there are vacancies and gaps caused by the moratorium because the army is an institution with a high rate of turnover and naturally that will have an impact.  We have made some progress and received some exemptions from the moratorium.  I am utterly confident that we will receive more.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian O’Shea</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         his views on whether there is a case for a Defence Forces role in promoting physical activity fitness and supporting the delivery of physical education in schools here as proposed in a recent paper (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [2293/10]

          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_372" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_518">Promoting physical fitness and supporting the delivery of physical education in schools is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">All physical education instructors within the Defence Forces are fully engaged in the training process.  Furthermore, the robust physical fitness training programme applied to Defence Forces training is not comparable or suitable for application in a school environment.  I understand from my colleague the Minister for Education and Science that the pre-service training of all primary teachers is designed to equip them to teach all aspects of the curriculum, including physical education.  At second level, PE is provided by specialist physical education teachers who have been trained to promote the physical, mental, emotional and social development of young people in an age-appropriate way through the medium of physical activity.  My colleague also advises me that continuing support is also available on an ongoing basis for practising teachers through the curriculum support services at primary and second level and that it is not considered necessary therefore to seek the input of the Defence Forces to supplement the work of schools in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_520">The role of physical education instructors within the Defence Forces is to ensure that Defence Forces personnel attain the level of fitness required of them in the context of filling the roles are assigned to them, here and on overseas missions.  As the Defence Forces are required to maintain a state of readiness to attend to any task that may be assigned, there is an onus to maintain an appropriate level of physical fitness at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Physical fitness contributes significantly to the effectiveness and general health of individuals in the Defence Forces.  Personnel who are unfit reduce operational effectiveness, put themselves at greater risk of injury and detract from the overall performance of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">Physical education and physical fitness have a key role to play in the context of the Defence Forces as they contribute to fitness, teamwork, leadership, self-discipline, determination, co-ordination, courage, competitive spirit and military ethos.  They play a role in recruitment and retention and in many instances provide excellent positive public visibility of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">In this context it is worth noting that 19 different sporting disciplines are played at unit and brigade level within the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">In addition to confidence and adventure, training in the Defence Forces makes an important contribution to the spirit, morale, personal development and ultimately, operational effectiveness of the individual.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_525">I find the Minister's response disappointing against the background of a strong military tradition of involvement in the delivery and shaping of physical education since the foundation of the State.  I do not think this involvement can be disputed.  There are also excellent models of best practice from other countries of supporting physical education and promoting physical activity and fitness in schools and the wider community.  If everything is as good as the Minister outlined, having conferred with his colleague the Minister for Education and Science, why do we have rising obesity levels in children, inadequate physical activity levels among children and gaps in the provision of physical education in schools?</p>
            <p eId="para_526">As was suggested to us by Mr. Michael McDonough, a retired Army captain, at a committee meeting, will the Minister consider having a small number of pilot projects to examine whether something can be moved forward?  Another issue which arose at the meeting was that the Reserve Defence Force does not attract the number of recruits that we would like.  This may be an area in which the Reserve Defence Force could get involved and attract more people.  I was very impressed with the presentation made at the committee meeting last week.  The submissions made deserve more examination and scrutiny and a positive approach rather than being dismissed out of hand in the way the Minister has done.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">The paper refers to the Defence Forces having a plethora of qualified personnel and a vast resource of equipment.  We do not have a plethora of qualified personnel.  I assure the Deputy that my advice and experience is that all of those providing physical fitness training in the army are fully taken up with the work they are supposed to do.  It is misleading to state that there is "X" amount of qualified people because some of them have moved on to other things.  For example, as far as I know the Chief of Staff is a qualified physical fitness instructor but he cannot engage in that type of work.</p>

With regard to making facilities such as gyms and PE halls available, this is done on a local basis.  It is up to the local barracks that has the facilities.  People make their own arrangements at local level and sometimes they tell us about them and sometimes they do not.  That is fine with us.  I reiterate that this is a matter primarily for the Minister for Education and Science.  However, if the Minister approaches me and wants to establish a multi-agency approach to this we will certainly have an input into it.</p>

            <p eId="para_545">Emergency planning is developed on the "lead Department" principle.  This means that each Department is responsible for planning for emergencies that fall within its area of responsibility.  The framework for major emergency management sets out the structure enabling the principal response agencies, namely, the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, to prepare for, and make a co-ordinated response to, major emergencies resulting from events such as severe weather.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">In accordance with the framework, the Defence Forces act as a support to locally based services.  All requests for the assistance of the Defence Forces are processed through the local authorities, the HSE and the Garda Síochána.  This ensures that there is an efficient, effective and co-ordinated response in accordance with prioritised local requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">Standing arrangements are in place for the civil authorities to request the assistance of the Defence Forces.  Requests for aid to the civil power are normally made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector.  Requests for assistance to local authorities are normally processed through local authority managers.  Requests for assistance from the HSE are normally received from chief emergency management officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">All assets, resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces throughout the country were made available to assist the civil authorities where and when called upon.  Defence liaison officers were appointed to all local emergency relief centres to co-ordinate Defence Forces assistance.  The Defence Forces provided assistance to a range of local authorities and to the HSE, utilising their 4x4 vehicles and trucks, while the Air Corps was also active in providing an air ambulance service and support for other emergency services.  The type of assistance provided by the Defence Forces includes gritting operations on roads and key junctions in many counties; the transportation of health care personnel to and from hospital, clinics and to patients in outlying areas; the transportation of patients to hospitals and clinics; the distribution of food and supplies in a number of areas; the delivery of water supplies in a number of local authority areas; the provision of transport for the Garda Síochána in Cork; and the provision of a number of air ambulance missions across the country.  An Air Corps helicopter was utilised to transport RTE engineers to repair a transmitter at Kippure Mountain in County Wicklow.  The Air Corps provided assistance to farmers with cattle on islands in Lough Ree to move fodder to their stock, at request of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">The Defence Forces responded to all official requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the severe weather period.</p>

            <p eId="para_550">I called for the involvement of the Defence Forces before the Minister was even aware that they should be out there.  I compliment them on what they achieved when they were used.  However, we were well into the big freeze before they were used, and people suffered as a result.  When he was asked on RTE about the involvement of the Defence Forces following my call for this to take place, the Minister's response was totally inadequate.  He said that we were not out there because we were not asked.  That surely was not an adequate response when we were in the middle of a major emergency crisis in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">One of the principal roles of the Defence Forces is to aid the civil power and to ensure that essential services are maintained at all times.</p>

            <p eId="para_553">Yes.  We had a flooding crisis before Christmas and a big freeze before and after Christmas.  The Defence Forces should have been ready without even being asked to go out there.  As the person in charge of the Office of Emergency Planning, the Minister for Defence sat on his hands while this whole crisis dragged on.  His response was reactive in the end, rather than proactive.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">There is a commitment on the website of the Office of Emergency Planning that a framework would be drawn up for weather emergencies to ensure that all existing local severe weather plans are appropriately co-ordinated and linked.  I asked the Minister on a radio programme one evening if this was in place.  He did not know the answer that evening, and I can accept that.  Can he confirm today that this framework is now place?  If we have a recurrence of severe weather conditions in 2010, can the Minister confirm that there will be a different response than that which we recently experienced?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_555">In 2008, I brought a document to the Government which outlined what happens in the event of various emergencies, including a weather situation like that which we have just experienced.  That document identified the lead Department in all cases.  For example, if there was an oil spillage off the coast, the Department of the Marine would lead.  If there was a terrorist attack, the Garda Síochána would lead.  In weather crises such as that which we recently experienced, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is the lead Department.  That Department summons the emergency response committee during the crisis appropriate to its area of responsibility.  That is the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">The national framework is there.  There is a framework for a local response.  At any time, the local committee can get together and request the assistance of the Army or anybody else.  Many such committees did not do so for reasons I do not know.  It is ludicrous to talk about the Army being ready because they were involved in the flood crisis.  The Army is an aid or back up when somebody asks it for help.  If groups ask the Army for help, they must ask for help in a specific way and at a specific place.  They might request the Air Corps to airlift fodder to cattle at a farm in Listowel because the owner is stuck.  They might request that somebody be taken to hospital in County Waterford due to an emergency.  In these cases, the Defence Forces get a specific task.  It is ludicrous to think of the Army wandering around the country without being requested to do anything, like latter day Don Quixotes, seeking out damsels in distress, riding MOWAGs instead of horses, and deciding to vanquish dragons whenever they happen to meet them.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">This is ludicrous.  The Army has to be asked.  It acts in response to a request.  During the crisis, the HSE was not slow in asking the Army for help.  It asked the Army for help from the first day of the frost to carry out air ambulance missions over and above what it had ordinarily been doing.  The HSE approached the Army to transport palliative care nurses in south Galway.  The HSE approached the Army with a request to do various things in the midlands, and the Army obliged.  However, the local authorities, which neither my party nor the Deputy's party controls, were very slow in asking for any assistance.  They did not appear to appreciate that the crisis was a local crisis to be dealt with at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_562">As this weather spell went on longer than anybody would have anticipated, contrary to the forecasts, the local crisis involved more than just accessibility of roads and other issues came into play which made it appropriate for the national emergency response committee to convene a meeting.  The committee met when it became appropriate to do so, and the Army was involved very heavily at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">The Army was available at all times.  It is ridiculous to talk about mobilising the Army and putting it on stand-by.  We are not talking about a part-time Army.  We have a full-time standing Army in this country that is mobilised and ready at all times.  It can be requested on foot of a local plan or national plan at any time at all.  The local authorities did not request the Army during the early stages of the crisis.  Apart from the fact that some of them were asleep, I suspect that the local authorities did not request the Army in many cases due to a lack of material, rather than a lack of personnel to put down the material.  The authorities had enough personnel to grit the roads and did not need any extra help.</p>

The Met Office can accurately forecast eight days ahead, and it even forecasted ten days beforehand that there would be a crisis.  Nonetheless, the Cabinet did not meet until 7 January.  There was a crisis for ten or 12 days before that.  We were snowed in on Christmas Day in Kerry, as were people in other parts of Ireland.

            <p eId="para_571">I would like to respond to that briefly.  Every county and city manager in this country has been informed about the framework for emergency planning.  Every county and city manager knows a mechanism is in place for establishing a local plan.  They also know that one must respond to circumstances such as those described without being directed, as the Deputy suggests, without anyone declaring a national emergency and without an emergency committee meeting taking place in Dublin.  The bottom line is that local authorities have responsibility for the accessibility of local roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">As regards any plan or documentation in the Department, I will make everything available to Deputy Deenihan.  There is nothing secret about this matter.  It is not like the third secret of Fatima.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_581">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body established by the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 pursuant to the Red Cross Act 1938 and is an independent, self-governing charitable institution.  By resolution passed by its council of delegates in November 2007, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC, urged all national societies, as requested by action 3 of the strategy for the movement, to examine and update their statutes, that is, the rules of the national societies, and related legal texts by 2010 in accordance with the "Guidance for National Society Statutes" and relevant international conference resolutions.  This task is being undertaken by many Red Cross and Red Crescent societies around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">In February 2008 the executive committee of the Irish Red Cross Society decided to establish a temporary working group on governance.  This group, in the course of its deliberations, also sought advice from the IFRC.  The chairman of the temporary working group made a presentation of its findings at the most recent meeting of the central council of the Irish Red Cross Society held at the end of November 2009.  The central council, which is the plenary body of the national society, agreed in principle to the changes proposed subject to interdepartmental and inter-agency consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The Department of Foreign Affairs which engages on an ongoing basis with the various components of the International Red Cross Movement and the Irish Red Cross Society in its overseas aid work will be invited to participate in these discussions.  The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has been and is supportive of the review process which was undertaken by the Irish Red Cross Society.  I am assured that the formal report of the working group will be delivered to my Department in the next few days.  The report will be discussed with relevant Departments and agencies and then brought before Government to give effect to any changes in legislation deemed necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">The Irish Red Cross Society is partly funded by a grant-in-aid from the Vote of the Department of Defence and I bring before Government such matters as are required by statute to be dealt with by Government.  I have no responsibility for the day-to-day running of the organisation.  However, as we are all aware, many organisations are currently faced with difficult financial constraints and it is incumbent on all of them to manage their affairs to minimise the effects of the recession.  As is the case in many organisations, the society must take whatever steps it deems necessary to ensure its financial viability.  The grant-in-aid to be provided by my Department for 2010 will be in the sum of €951,000 which is unchanged from the amount provided for in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">I am aware that the former Secretary General who was on secondment from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has now returned to that Department.  I acknowledge with thanks his role in pursuing the issue of governance.  The position of Secretary General is being filled in an acting capacity pending the recruitment of a full-time Secretary General.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_416">
            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_587">It is extraordinary that a report approved in principle by the central committee of the Irish Red Cross Society on 28 November 2009 has still not been submitted to the Department.  There are urgent reasons for the changes that are necessary.  In the event that the review does not address certain areas which the Minister, on the basis of advice and his own analysis, considers to be necessary, will he add to the recommendations made in the report?</p>
            <p eId="para_588">Will legislation be required to implement the recommendations of the review?  Will the Minister give an undertaking to address the matter expeditiously?  Press coverage of the Irish Red Cross Society is not of the type we would like to see surrounding this important national organisation which has done much good nationally and internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">We cannot afford to waste time.  When the Minister receives the report he should deal with it expeditiously.  I ask him to give an undertaking that he will do so.  While Deputies will be aware of speculation concerning the contents of the report, we do not know precisely what is in it.  If the Minister decides the report does not go far enough, will he be disposed to go further?  It appears that governance issues in the Irish Red Cross Society must be addressed effectively and clearly to strengthen the image of the organisation against the background of the current flow of negative press coverage.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_417" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_590">I concur with the Deputy that the bad press is extremely regrettable.  I am in a difficult position as Minister because, under the terms of the Geneva Convention, the Government is obliged by law to ensure the independence of the Red Cross.  Although the Government provides the Irish Red Cross Society with a grant-in-aid of almost €1 million per annum and supplies a building owned by the Office of Public Works free of charge, I am, nevertheless, precluded from becoming involved in the internal day-to-day running of the organisation.  Under the 1938 Act, this function is to be exercised by the central council and executive committee of the Irish Red Cross Society.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">Notwithstanding the adverse publicity which has surrounded the Irish Red Cross Society for some time, I did not initiate the board's recommendations because I am not involved in the day-to-day running of the society.  The recommendations were prompted by a suggestion made by the international body in 2007 that Red Cross organisations in different countries should examine their governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">While I do not know the reason the report has not been formally submitted to me, I am aware of 90% of its contents, having received an account of what it is in the document.  In my opinion, legislation will be required to implement the terms of the report.  That is not, however, a statement of fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">I assure Deputy O'Shea that the issue of legislation will not cause undue delay.  A delay may arise from inter-agency consultation as checks are made to determine precisely what legislative changes are needed.  I will do my best to expedite the process.  I agree with the Deputy on that matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">On the Deputy's question as to whether I will make further recommendations and add to the report, with the best will in the world, I am not legally entitled to do so.  In light of the provisions of the relevant legislation and the requirement on the Government to maintain the independence of the Irish Red Cross Society under the Geneva Convention, it appears that it is a matter for those who have been elected to run the Red Cross to make the changes themselves.  However, if I can do anything, within the law, to assist the Irish Red Cross Society in putting an end to recent bad publicity and establishing a better governance structure, I will be pleased to do so.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_418">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_595">The Minister has been rather passive in this matter.  Given that the Department is providing almost €1 million to the Irish Red Cross Society, surely the Minister has some responsibility to ensure the society is run properly.  If the Minister is in a position to introduce legislation, he must surely have an input in the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">Does the Minister agree that it is extraordinary that both the chairman and chief executive of the Irish Red Cross Society have resigned?  I understand this is not the first time a chief executive of the organisation has resigned.  This indicates there must be something wrong in the governance of the organisation.  The Minister stated that the report, about which he knows a great deal, was drafted in November but has not yet been published officially.  Surely that smacks of irresponsibility in another way and a lack of accountability and transparency.  There is a problem in the Red Cross in Ireland.  Otherwise, a distinguished former Member of this House would not step down and a former executive of the Irish Government, who was highly respected and who we all know, would not have stepped down.  The Minister says he can do nothing about this but I do not accept it when he provides almost €1 million of Government funding.  At this stage, can the Minister authorise a senior ranking official in his Department to draw up a report for him?  The proposed legislation will require some involvement by his Department.  Can the Minister authorise that simple investigation into why this happened?  Our reputation abroad has been somewhat tarnished by the debacle in the Red Cross.  I know this from feedback I received.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">Recently the Red Cross collected money for flood relief.  It has not yet been distributed.  Does the Minister have an indication of how much was collected or is that not his responsibility?  When will it be disbursed?</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_419" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_598">Regarding the final question, it is not my responsibility.  The Red Cross is statutorily independent but I will find out for Deputy Deenihan how much it collected and when it will be distributed.  I wish to correct the record of the House.  Deputy Deenihan quoted me as saying I can do absolutely nothing.  Anyone who has been in the House for the past two or three minutes knows that is not what I said.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_425" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_604">My Department has a member on the executive council who regularly reports to the Department.  I have a fair idea of the situation without commissioning separate investigations.  The board appointed a committee to carry out an investigation and has made recommendations.  My job is to make legislative changes to enable the board to make those changes.  It is not rocket science.  Surely Deputy Deenihan can understand this.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_606">As regards getting involved in investigations and making changes, under the Geneva Convention Ireland is committed to maintaining an independent Red Cross.  An independent Red Cross means an autonomous organisation that runs its own show, whose executive council deals with governance matters and matters that have come out in the media in recent times.  That is the law and that is what we signed up to as a nation.  With the best will in the world, even if I provided €951 million rather than €951,000, I could do not do anything about that.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">Radical proposals have been made to change the governance structures of the Red Cross, which are the subject of much controversy as referred to by Deputy O'Shea.  My role is to examine the recommendations, see which ones require legislative change and provide and pass the appropriate legislation in the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">I do not want to get into specific recommendations.  Much has been made of the chairman's resignation.  Some time ago, the chairman told me he wanted to wait until the report recommending reform of the Red Cross had gone through the system and that he would then offer up his position.  That is precisely what happened.  The Secretary General wanted to return to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We are now in the process of recruiting a new Secretary General.  There is no great mystery.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_617">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 109 and 261 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Ireland has offered, through the UN stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS, to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army excluding reserves and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">Ireland currently contributes 758 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following tabular statement.  The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the United Nations mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT, with 419 personnel, the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo with 236 personnel and the EU-led operation, ALTHEA, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with 44 personnel.  Other personnel serve as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE.  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">As outlined in the budget in December 2009, it has been decided that the Defence Forces commitments to overseas peace support operations will be scaled back in 2010 as one of the budgetary expenditure reductions.  The operations where Ireland will reduce its commitments will be KFOR in Kosovo and Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In April 2010 at the next rotation, it is planned to draw down Irish personnel from KFOR from the current 236 personnel to approximately 50 and to retain a small residual component post-October 2010.  In July 2010, at the end of the next rotation to Operation ALTHEA, Ireland will reduce its current contribution of 44 personnel to approximately five.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">Regarding MINURCAT, the Government is committed to retaining the Defence Forces presence in Chad beyond 14 March 2010, subject to renewal by the UN Security Council of MINURCAT's mandate beyond that date.  I will bring proposals to the Government in due course seeking formal approval for the Defence Forces continued participation in this mission beyond 14 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">The strength of all overseas deployment is assessed in line with the prevailing security situation in the mission area.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces are self-sufficient in large troop deployment missions in terms of force protection and security and are integrated into the overall force protection and security plans of all other missions.  The Defence Forces conduct a threat assessment on mission areas and all deployment meets the requirements of security and force protection for all personnel integrated into the overall mission requirement.</p>

            <p eId="para_701">I thank the Minister for his reply.  We are all proud of the work our Defence Forces do out foreign.  It gives a positive image of this country despite the internal turmoil we are experiencing here.  Perhaps the Minister can indicate the factors that he or his officials can take into consideration when considering involvement in a mission such as one in Haiti, if one were in the offing.  Specifically, in terms of personnel and cost savings, what are the effects of Ireland's intended reduction in the KFOR and ALTHEA missions?  Do we intend to maintain any Irish troop presence in Kosovo or Bosnia-Herzegovina?  Have the Minister and his officials examined the estimated cost of the withdrawal of Irish troops from the UN mission in Chad, as recommended in the McCarthy report?  Do we have a figure for that?  How much money has the UN given to Ireland in reimbursements since March 2009?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_702">The factors taken into account when considering participation in a mission include whether a peacekeeping operation is the most appropriate response, how the mission relates the priorities of Irish foreign policy, the degree of risk involved, the extent to which the required skills and characteristics relate to Irish capabilities, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, with the potential to contribute to a political solution, and whether the operation is adequately resourced, in the context of the level of existing commitments to peacekeeping operations and security requirements at home.  I will respond to the other questions asked by Deputy Deenihan.  The scaling down of the operations in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will save €7 million in 2010 and €13 million in a full year.  We will not adopt the McCarthy report's recommendation that Irish troops should be withdrawn from Chad.  I understand that if we decided now to withdraw from Chad, the UN would be liable for the cost.  It would not cost us anything.  Our involvement in Chad costs us €16 million, in gross terms, per annum.  Our rebate from the UN is over €8 million, which means that our net cost is almost €8 million per annum.  The amount received from the UN in the period in question was approximately €3 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I am sure the Minister will agree that overseas missions are the lifeblood of any defence force.  If we want to develop the Defence Forces, they will have to get overseas experience.  It has been proven that the Defence Forces will suffer if they do not get such experience.  I would like to ask the Minister a few simple questions.  How will the embargo on recruitment affect Ireland's involvement in overseas missions?  I understand there will be some recruitment in 2010.  Perhaps the Minister might confirm what form it will take.  While I accept that the Minister announced 40 promotions today, the general moratorium on promotions is having an effect on command structures.  Personnel are not being appointed to the upper ranks where they are critically needed.  We also have an issue with our medical corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Many recommendations have been made with regard to the appointment and restructuring of the medical corps, but they do not seem to have been implemented.  There are significant problems with medical backup services and medical evacuations, especially in places like Chad.  It is a substantial challenge.  Perhaps the Minister will answer the questions I have asked about the moratorium on recruitment and promotions.</p>

            <p eId="para_705">When these wind-downs have taken place, the number of personnel working overseas will fall from 758 to 480.  There will continue to be a substantial number of people based overseas.  I have been informed that if the proposal I have submitted to the Minister for Finance is accepted — even partially — we will continue to be in a position to send troops overseas.  Our capacity to send troops overseas will not be affected.  I accept that the Department now has to operate within a much tighter budget, due to the state of the public finances.  I assure the Deputy that we will be recruiting in 2010, in order to maintain a figure of 10,000 personnel in the Army.  I was also asked about the extent to which operational structures will be affected by the moratorium.  It is obvious that the moratorium will have an impact on such structures, although it will be alleviated to some extent by the 50 promotions — broken down between 13 officers and 37 non-commissioned officers — for which we are providing.</p>

We ensure that they have access to level 1 medical facilities, at least.  They are tested before they go and after they come back.  They are immunised against known diseases.  They have their own water purification and sanitation facilities.  We talk to others who will be involved in the collective mission to ensure that the health of all our troops who participate in foreign missions is properly secured.

We must consider a number of factors in deciding overseas missions.  We obviously must have regard to the financial situation and the need to work within tight constraints.  If the mission is led by the UN, we are entitled to a rebate, and this will certainly be one of our considerations when deciding to sign up to future missions.  The UN also sanctions certain missions organised by other powers, in which case the costs are paid where they fall.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_745">I propose to takes Questions Nos. 75, 86 and 87 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The PA report is an important milestone in addressing the challenges to the provision of medical services in the Defence Forces.  Implementation will take time and commitment.  On receipt of the report in June 2009, I accepted the recommendations and asked that implementation of the recommendations proceed immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">The report reviewed the medical services required for the Defence Forces in light of their roles and operations, assessed the current arrangements for the provision of medical services and proposed a model for future delivery of medical services.  Some of the major recommendations are focused on making better use of existing clinical resources and thereby providing a better medical service and reducing the spend on outsourcing.  The savings in outsourcing are to be achieved mainly through the re-focussing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks with administration functions being undertaken by non-clinical personnel; a reduction in the number of doctor interventions and medical assessments; and better management of health services outsourcing.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">In order to achieve the saving in outsourcing, a major restructuring of the medical corps has to be completed.  A number of working groups have been established to deal with the various aspects of this restructuring and several have already made recommendations which are being considered by the steering committee overseeing the project.  As regards the frequency of medical assessments, one of the working groups is currently looking at clinical issues and has made recommendations which are currently under consideration.  I expect substantial progress to be made over the coming 12 months in implementing recommendations.  Some issues will be resolved quickly while others will require significant consideration and will, for example, require negotiation with the representative associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">It is difficult at this stage of implementation to estimate the savings that can be achieved through reduced outsourcing as much of our requirement depends on a number of factors.  However, I expect that savings on outsourcing could be made through the implementation of the PA recommendations.  Implementation of the recommendations will result in major change at both strategic and operational levels in the Defence Forces.  Thankfully in these difficult times, the report shows that major additional investment is not needed to meet the medical needs of the Defence Forces.  Change will be achieved mainly through better use of the available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.  The services of civilian medical practitioners are used to provide backup to the medical corps in ensuring that the primary health care requirements arising in barracks are met.  As the Defence Forces will never be able to meet all medical requirements from internal medical personnel, outsourcing will continue to be required.  However, implementation of the PA recommendations will ensure that outsourcing will be reduced for primary care and that outsourced services will be procured and managed in a more cost-effective way.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">Can the Minister indicate whether any of the recommendations were implemented?  Many of the major recommendations were intended for immediate implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">A newspaper article from last weekend reported that Defence Forces personnel had to travel to another pharmacy because a qualified chemist had not been appointed to the medical corps to dispense medication.  It is not acceptable that the position of chemist is not filled.  Was that report accurate?</p>
            <p eId="para_753">There is a malaise in the medical corps.  Its establishment figure is 46 but the most recent figures given by the Minister reveal that its staffing level is only 23.  The first question I put to the Minister after he was appointed to his position was on the medical corps because the Defence Forces need to be supported by an adequate medical service.  He commissioned a report and gave his commitment that urgent action would be taken.  Unfortunately, I believe he is sitting on the report and I ask for a timetable for its implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_760">It is difficult to strike the correct balance.  The same departmental officials who are overseeing the moratorium, a reduction of staff and decentralisation to Newbridge while preparing a value-for-money report into the Reserve Defence Force and a new White Paper are also responsible for implementing the PA report.  Given the radical nature of the recommendations, we cannot expect instant action, but I expect substantial progress over the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">In regard to Deputy Deenihan's immediate question, one of the central recommendations of the PA report was on establishing a structure to oversee change.  A programme group and a steering committee has been formed to address this recommendation.  Since the last time we discussed this matter in the House, the programme group and the steering committee have held a number of meetings and five working groups have commenced work.  The clinical review working group, which is designing new processes and protocols relating to the delivery of clinical services, has completed an interim report which is now being considered by the programme group.  The organisation and establishment working group, which is tasked with designing a new structure for the medical corps to incorporate a non-clinical administration unit, has issued a progress report to the programme group.  A future medical information system review working group has been established to analyse the information technology requirements for future medical service delivery.  The group has completed an analysis of current information systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">In regard to financial arrangements, an outsourcing review working group has been established to examine the current arrangements in the medical corps for the outsourcing of services.  Based on public procurement guidelines, the review group will make recommendations by which the new central medical unit will procure its future outsourcing and services requirements.  We are essentially seeking in all of this to obtain better use from existing medical staff so that we will not need as large an establishment in future.  We will ensure better value for the people we are employing, which will mean less outsourcing.  In tandem with that, we are reviewing the arrangements for outsourcing to ensure better value for money in that aspect.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_765">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 111 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">The Defence Forces' property portfolio is kept under review by my Department to ensure the most effective use of military resources having regard to the roles assigned by Government to the forces.  The closure of Army barracks and the consolidation of Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the White Paper on Defence.  The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training.  It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">In the context of the 2009 budget, the Government approved the closure of four barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in County Donegal, as well as at St. Bricin's Hospital in Dublin.  The four barracks closed at the end of January 2009.  The closure of St. Bricin's is linked to the planned decentralisation of Defence Forces headquarters to the Curragh.  The report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes noted that my Department has identified 33 properties for disposal.  The disposal of these will take account of market conditions in order to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The future of Cathal Brugha Barracks and the question of any further consolidation across the Defence Forces as a whole are among the issues being considered having regard to the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  Cathal Brugha Barracks is a significant military installation with a broad range of facilities, accommodation and storage depots.  The special group noted that: "Given the scale of any relocation, the provision of alternative accommodation would entail a significant up-front cost and a lead time of some years."  This will be factored into our consideration, particularly in the current financial situation.  Consideration will also be given to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  It is unlikely that Cathal Brugha Barracks will be disposed of in the next four to five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The funding realised from the disposal of surplus property, together with pay savings, has provided resources for the modernisation of the Defence Forces and has been invested in new infrastructure, equipment and training area development.  Properties that are considered surplus to military requirements will continue to be disposed of and the funding invested to meet the current and future equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_486" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_775">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 98, 119, 264 and 270 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">The Defence Forces, which include the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, in their role as aid to the civil power, that is, the Garda Síochána, and to the civil authorities, that is, local authorities, the Health Service Executive and so on, recently provided emergency assistance in an effort to alleviate the problems caused by the adverse weather conditions throughout the State.  All assets, resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces were made available to provide assistance as required.  Defence liaison officers were appointed to all local emergency relief centres to co-ordinate Defence Forces assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The Defence Forces provided assistance to a range of local authorities and to the Health Service Executive, utilising their 4x4 vehicles and trucks, while the Air Corps was also active in providing an air ambulance service and support for other emergency services.  The major Defence Forces commitments included: transportation of health care personnel to and from hospital and clinics and to patients in outlying areas such as Galway, Drogheda, Cork, Tullamore, Naas, Donard, Enniscorthy, Tiglin, Wicklow, Tullow, Gorey, Harolds Cross Hospice, Blackrock Hospice and the Drogheda House Hospice in Kildare; transportation of patients to hospitals and clinics in Naas, Wicklow and Tullamore; distribution of meals on wheels in several areas such as Cobh, Gormanstown and Balbriggan; gritting of roads and junctions, at the request of the local authorities, in counties Kildare, Meath and Leitrim; gritting of the Health Service Executive ambulance centre in Cork; delivery of water supplies in several local authority areas such as Mullingar, Drogheda and Kilkenny; movement of machinery from Dublin Airport to Wicklow for use in dispersing animal feed; provision of eight 4x4 vehicles to transport members of the Garda Síochána in Cork; and utilisation of aircraft to render assistance to the Health Service Executive, RTE and members of the farming community .</p>
            <p eId="para_778">Defence Forces personnel and materials were also made available to local authorities as the thaw set in.  The most notable deployment in this regard was in Skibbereen where 36 personnel and several vehicles were engaged in flood relief operations including the filling and placing of sandbags in strategic locations throughout the town.  The Defence Forces responded to all official requests for assistance received from the civil authorities during the period of severe weather.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">This followed on from the substantial commitment provided by the Defence Forces to the civil authorities during the floods last November.  During that period, the Defence Forces provided assistance in Cork city, Shannon Banks in Limerick, Ennis, Ballinasloe, Athlone, Athy, Sallins, Bantry, Carlow, Clonakilty, Clonmel, Kilkenny and Longford.  The Defence Forces, at the request of Roscommon County Council and Galway County Council, transported civilian personnel in flood-affected areas.  The main effort was in Cork city where more than 200 Defence Forces personnel provided assistance to the local authority with engineer support at the Lee Fields pumping station, the distribution of drinking and sanitation water to approximately 22 locations on the north side of the city and sandbagging duty.  The Defence Forces also provided assistance to the Health Service Executive at the Mercy Hospital.  The Naval Service provided engineer support in the form of engineer teams with water pumps.  The <i>LE Orla</i> provided back-up assistance including communications and catering.  Rigid inflatable boats, RIBs, were provided to support river searches.  The Air Corps provided aerial reconnaissance support to local authorities and air transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The framework for major emergency management sets out a structure enabling the principal response agencies, namely, the Garda Síochána, Health Service Executive and local authorities, to prepare for and make a co-ordinated response to major emergencies resulting from events such as fires, transport accidents, hazardous substance incidents and severe weather.  The major emergency plans that have been developed by local and regional authorities identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.  The involvement of the Defence Forces in responding to emergencies arises from requests for assistance from the Garda Síochána, that is, aid to the civil power, or from other agencies of the State, that is, aid to the civil authority.  The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the assistance requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">The Government task force on emergency planning supports co-ordination of emergency planning across Departments and key agencies.  The task force meets on a regular basis and provides a forum for sharing information and keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Departments.  At each meeting representatives of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces provide an update on the security threat analysis.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">I attended a public meeting in Newcastle West on Monday night where the issue of the response of public services and agencies during the recent severe weather was discussed.  Several public representatives from the party that controls Limerick County Council were adamant that a request for assistance was submitted to Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick but that no assistance was forthcoming.  By implication, the claim was that no assistance was forthcoming from the Minister.  Will the Minister clarify whether a formal request was submitted by Limerick County Council to the officer commanding at Sarsfield Barracks for assistance during the recent cold spell?  While some members of the council, with the backing of council management, insist there was a formal request for help, the information I have is different.</p>

The answer to Deputy Collins's question is most emphatically that there was no formal request from Limerick County Council for assistance from the Army to the CO at Slattery Barracks and if such a request had been made, help would have been forthcoming.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">In reply to Deputy O'Shea, I do not know why they were so tardy.  Local authorities should know the structures that exist.  In any case, I have now taken the initiative of writing to all city and county managers to inform them of the procedures.</p>

Lessons are always learned from every situation.

         the steps he is taking to facilitate an urgent resolution of today’s proposed industrial action by more than 300 air traffic controllers at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports given that it may cause the cancellation of more than 100 flights, severely disrupt thousands of air travellers and have a negative effect on the national and local economies; the way in which he is utilising all the industrial relations machinery of the State to bring about an immediate end to the dispute; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_512">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_812">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Deputies opposite for the opportunity to outline the background to the current industrial relations dispute at the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports and to bring Deputies up to date with the air traffic control problems at the three State airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">I am very disappointed that air traffic controllers are disrupting the travel plans of thousands of air passengers from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. this afternoon.  The action arises in the context of an industrial relations dispute between the company and the air traffic controllers' trade union, IMPACT.  The immediate cause of the dispute is a withdrawal by IMPACT of co-operation with new technology since 1 January and the consequent suspension of a number of air traffic controllers.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">However, I am advised that the issues at the core of this dispute are the non-payment of increases under Towards 2016 and the issue of an employee contribution towards the IAA superannuation scheme.  The dispute was referred to the Labour Relations Commission and a hearing on 14 January last failed to resolve the matter.  A Labour Court hearing on the pay and technology issues was scheduled for 26 January and the IAA requested IMPACT to desist from industrial action and maintain normal co-operation with the introduction of new technology pending the outcome of the hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The IAA has advised me that it is ready to co-operate fully with the industrial relations machinery of the State with a view to addressing these issues quickly and in full.  To that end the authority would be willing to lift suspensions immediately if air traffic controllers return to the co-operation with the technology projects as applied up to 31 December last.  I would urge both parties to avail of the services of the Labour Court and to make every possible effort to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The dispute must be considered in the context of the impact of the downturn in the aviation sector on the lAA's customers, namely, the airlines.  The IAA has pointed out that this country has witnessed the biggest decline in aviation traffic in Europe and the continuing downturn means that the IAA is under very strong pressure from airlines to minimise cost increases.  The world's commercial airlines are set to lose $5.6 billion this year, following an estimated loss of $11 billion dollars last year.  European carriers, many of which are IAA customers, are on track to generate the largest losses of any region in 2010 of $2.5 billion.  Of the lAA's top ten customers, only one is currently making a profit.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Deputies will be aware that Aer Lingus is currently implementing a major transformation plan with the agreement of staff.  Similarly, the Dublin Airport Authority has negotiated a cost reduction package.  Employees in both companies have also taken cuts in pay and allowances, improved roster flexibility, and additional productivity measures.  That is the real aviation environment in which the IAA must operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">Air traffic controllers are very highly paid, have suffered no pay cuts and are not subject to the public service pension levy, as the IAA is a commercial State body.  The majority of air traffic controllers are former civil servants who transferred to the IAA on 1 January 1994.  They make no contribution to their pension fund while the IAA pays 30.5% of gross pay towards the fund, which in 2009 had an actuarial deficit of €234 million.  The IAA introduced a new defined benefit scheme with employee contributions for all those recruited on or after 1 April 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">My Department is closely monitoring developments in the air traffic controller dispute.  I hope that both sides in this dispute can recognise the imperative of reaching agreement.  I urge them to work constructively with the Labour Court with a view to resolving this matter.</p>

          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_513">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I thank the Minister for his reply and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to raise this issue.  This morning the Taoiseach referred to the strike as an inconvenience to travellers.  I do not think he was trying to belittle the effect, but it does not even begin to describe the enormity of the damage that this has already done to this country's reputation, tourism and jobs.  There is not a single job in this country that does not depend to some extent on the people and goods which come and go through our airports.  Although I do not want to belittle it, it is an outrage that what is effectively a petty little dispute involving 15 people has been allowed to close down the entire country.  It is unforgivable.  At any time, we would be sending out the wrong message, but at a time when the country is on its knees economically and we are in the middle of a national economic crisis unlike anything we have faced before, it is unforgivable that this should happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">Only this morning, as the Minister noted, the tourism figures for last year were announced.  We lost €1 billion in tourism revenue last year due to the loss of 1 million tourists.  Only two days ago, the Dublin Airport Authority announced it was slashing its landing charges and in some cases abolishing them so desperate is it to try to stop the haemorrhage of routes out of Ireland, which is having a hugely damaging effect on the country in every sense but particularly on the tourism industry, where hotels are closing and jobs are being lost.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">It is almost as if we have a death wish to allow something like this to happen.  I cannot describe to the Minister how outraged people are to have their jobs jeopardised in this way.  What they want is the assurance that it cannot happen again, that a few people cannot bring the country to its knees in a way such as this and jeopardise jobs.  I want the Minister's assurance, particularly if this dispute is to continue, that at the least he is investigating the possibility of bringing in the Air Corps or, if necessary, bringing in expertise from abroad or from Northern Ireland, which I understand is available.  This can be brought in at short notice to man the air traffic control towers if those who are very well paid for this will not do it for us.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_514">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_823">Does the Minister agree that this is an act of economic sabotage by a very highly paid group of workers?  The average pay for these workers is over €160,000 per year, which is a lot of money.  They do a very important job that is critical to our economy — we all know that — so it is imperative that they go back to work immediately and that they and the IAA get together with the Labour Relations Commission to sort out this issue.  Nobody has any sympathy for them or what they are doing.  They are destroying the good name of the country and they are affecting business people travelling today who would have had routes planned for many years.  People are coming here to set up employment and do something about lifting our economy off the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">Does the Minister agree it is time for him and the Government to take action on this issue?  Two years ago, a strike was threatened by this group.  The Minister at that time agreed with me that there ought to be a no-strike clause in the employment contract of essential transport workers like these.  Is it not a fact that the Labour Relations Commission in 1994 identified workers in this area and other emergency workers who should never be able to have a wildcat strike?  It is unacceptable in a modern age that our economy can be held to ransom by these people.  Will the Minister return to the commitment he made two years ago to introduce legislation to make sure this can never happen again?  They are well paid, highly intelligent and capable people who do an excellent job.  They are able to sit down with their union, IMPACT, and the Labour Relations Commission and the IAA to solve the issues but they should not hold the country to ransom.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">The Minister will be held accountable for failing to act on this.  For two years he has introduced no legislation and there has been no change.  His work programme for this Dáil session contains no legislation other than two small merchant shipping Bills.  He is asleep at the wheel and letting the country collapse around him.  He is not dealing with the issues he said he would deal with two years ago.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_515">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_826">Everyone agrees that this is an appalling situation for tens of thousands of travellers, including business people, holiday makers and people coming and going to see their relatives.  Some are stranded this afternoon at foreign airports, which is a truly horrendous situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The first question that will be asked is what exactly the Minister has done to try to prevent this happening.  Although, generally, the public did not know about this until yesterday, a few hours before this disaster befell us and we lost 120 flights, the Minister and his Department have known since the beginning of this month that there was a dispute in regard to the new air management system which this country operates along with Denmark and Sweden, and the 10% or so of controllers who are routinely pulled out of daily operations to retrain into new systems — this was a significant new system.  Is it true that the IAA informed the Minister early this month that this crisis was coming down the line and that no steps were taken to try to avert it and prevent this ongoing disaster?</p>
            <p eId="para_828">We have seen people in floods of tears at the airport, some from the other side of the world who are visiting our country, spending money here and supporting Irish jobs.  Many have missed their connections, which is an appalling prospect for them.  Did the Minister know about this?  Was he informed by Mr. Brennan or Mr. Kavanagh, the director of human resources at the IAA, that this was taking place?  Given there was a Labour Court process and that the LRC had dealt with this, why were there suspensions?  The Minister said the substantive issues also include a possible pay change related to Towards 2016 and the huge €234 million hole in the pension fund.  However, these issues were going to the Labour Court next week so why did these suspensions take place?  Does the Minister agree that all suspensions should be ended and people should be asked to get into the industrial relations machinery to try to resolve this matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_829">My party leader mentioned an important point to the Minister this morning, namely, that before Christmas the Minister and the Government abandoned social partnership.  We have the national implementation body.  A Deputy referred to the problem we had in this regard two or three years ago when we discussed in the House what was only a threatened strike action at that time.  This could go the national implementation body.  Does a national implementation body still exist?  Has it got a role?  Could it have prevented today's events from happening and enabled our vital aviation industry to go forward?</p>
            <p eId="para_830">It is a desperate situation and, unfortunately, once again a major aspect of our transport infrastructure, one of the most important of all because we are an island people, has been allowed to stop.  The Minister is the man on the bridge.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">Deputy Broughan asked me why there were suspensions.  There were suspensions because the people were going into work and refusing to do the work they were doing up to 31 December 2009.  They were allowed to do that for the best part of three weeks while the IAA tried to resolve the difficulties and the IAA decided——</p>

            <p eId="para_842">The Deputy does not want to hear this.  It did not sound as if he knew about it.  He asked me why there were suspensions and I am telling him.  It is because people who are well paid decided that they could go into work and not do what they were being asked to do, and challenge management because of another dispute they were having with regard to a 6% pay increase.  That is why the suspensions took place.  This is not a disaster which befell us but rather something these people decided they would do.  The kind of operation they have been asked to undertake is work which they have been doing up to now.  One of them, a scheme called the cross-runway operation, was done by them up to two years ago but they did not need to continue it because there was talk of putting in place a parallel runway.  As that has been deferred they were asked to go back to the cross-runway operation but they have refused to do so.  That is one of the disputes, and the others involve equally ridiculous reasons for going on strike.  If people want to start pointing the finger, as the Deputy seems to, they should point it in the right direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">Having said that, it is important that both sides get into the Labour Court.  The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has made it clear that it is willing to engage again.  As I stated in my reply, the authority is willing to withdraw the suspensions and go to the Labour Court if it can be facilitated.  I understand an early hearing could take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">The issue is very simple and straightforward.  The IAA is willing to go to the Labour Court, which is the body that decides and tries to operate the industrial relations machinery of the State.  The Government does not interfere in that as it is a matter between management and unions.  The issue will be resolved in the Labour Court rather than here or anywhere else.  The sooner the parties get to the Labour Court, the better.</p>

            <p eId="para_855">Will the Minister address the issue of a no-strike clause, particularly for emergency workers and those providing an essential service to the economic well-being of the State?  We are an island nation and totally dependent on air links to get off the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">I agree with the Minister in that this is a completely unnecessary action which should not be happening.  The consequences of this action by a small number of well-paid workers, who the Minister has indicated are not subject to any pay cuts or pension levies that other public servants have been subject to, are great and they can hold the country to ransom.  The consequences of the action far outstrip the impact on the air traffic controllers themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">In his response the Minister indicated readiness to co-operate with the industrial relations machinery of the State with a view to addressing these issues quickly.  The IAA has offered to lift the suspensions immediately and return to the position as it pertained on 31 December 2009.  That is new information to me.  Was that conveyed to the air traffic controllers before 2 p.m. today, when they went on strike, as I know they are talking about escalating their action?  Although it is not an agreeable situation, if we could revert to the position as it pertained on 31 December 2009 it would at least get this country back working again.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_539">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_858">I was not going to participate in the debate but like many other people I am incensed by what is happening in Irish airports today, whether it is my own airport in Cork, Dublin or elsewhere.  We have enough obstacles as a country and an economy without 300 people deciding to shut down Ireland for four hours with respect to air traffic.  In addition, they are inconveniencing all the other airlines which transit through Irish airspace on journeys that do not involve landing in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">I wish to emphasise again the point made by Deputy O'Dowd.  Will the Minister ensure that we will not see a repeat of this in future by introducing legislation that will require a no-strike element or clause in the contracts of air traffic controllers in future?  The Minister could go even further and make it illegal for controllers to strike by putting them in the same category as the Garda, the fire services and the Army, which legally are not allowed to strike.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">There must of course be industrial relations machinery that can allow people to air their grievances and facilitate discussions on the introduction of new technology or pay agreements, for example.  The capacity must exist to deal with complex or indeed simple problems.  The Labour Relations Commission exists for that.  I welcome the Minister's unambiguous statement as to who is to blame.  With an issue such as this the public has a right to expect that the Government will take charge of this issue and ensure it will not happen again.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">I regard air traffic control as absolutely essential to the running of an island economy and people should be able to come and go from this island without having this kind of farcical disruption, which is costing this country a fortune in finance and reputation.  The Minister would get strong support from this party if he moved to ensure there is no repeat of this and at the same time took a responsible approach to ensuring that genuine industrial relations can be resolved.  The recourse to strike action and holding a country to ransom to try to ratchet up pressure on the Irish Aviation Authority is a totally unacceptable tactic in a dispute between the two bodies at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_862">There is no doubt that Reaganism is alive and well, judging by some of the commentary I have heard.  I want to be constructive but what does the Minister intend to do to resolve this issue? Nothing can be resolved unless there is dialogue and people are prepared to sit down and talk their way through the process.  People have been suspended despite other avenues being open.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">I suggest that the Minister meet with unions if possible and try to resolve the issue between both sides as quickly as possible.  I welcome that the IAA is now prepared to withdraw the suspensions, as that may leave some room for manoeuvre.  Is the Minister prepared to meet with union officials on the issue?</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_864">I also welcome the IAA response.  Nobody is disputing that the withdrawal of a service by a small group of critical workers is a disproportionate response, to put it mildly, to the issues involved, particularly in a case that most of the public were completely unaware of.  On investigation, it seems quite clear there was an industrial relations process in train and the LRC was involved.  There was to be a Labour Court hearing next week.  When such a process exists, it is obviously incumbent on everybody — workers and management in such a critical role for our country — to ensure they get to the talking stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">My understanding is a number of people were suspended with pay over a number of weeks.  I accept that we have just come from a committee meeting which held an intense debate on the near-collapse of the transport system during the recent freeze-up.  In spite of that, there is no evidence that we have had a hands-on approach, as the last Deputy said, from the Minister to ensure the industrial relations machinery maintains service and connectivity, which is a key requirement for our economy.  What did the Minister do and what is he doing to ensure that this situation will not prevail for another minute?</p>

            <p eId="para_868">I have not changed my view on this issue.  If anything, this action has strengthened my view.  It is not a decision I can make on my own regarding specific areas.  This option will have to be examined in a number of areas across a number of Departments.  If this kind of disruption and, as Deputy Broughan said, this disproportionate response to an industrial relations issue will be a feature of industrial relations in this country, every option will have to be examined.  I and every Member of the House believes this is a disproportionate response.  I will raise the matter in the first instance with my colleagues in Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">On the matter of meeting representatives of the union, if they will not go to the Labour Court and use that machinery of the State I would not have much faith that they would decide to meet me.  In other circumstances I am sure Deputies on all sides of House, but particularly those on the side represented by Deputy Broughan, would be the first to object if I was to interfere in the day-to-day operation of any of these companies.  Access to the considerable machinery of the State is available to resolve difficulties and on the union side and management side it has worked fairly successfully.  That is the route that should be followed in this case.  It is a matter for both sides to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The IAA has made an offer in inverted commas.  That has been known since mid-day.  It issued a statement at 12.15 p.m. today to the effect that it was prepared to do that.  To my knowledge, there has not been any direct or indirect response by the union to that offer.  As Deputy Broughan has acknowledged, and I thank him for doing so, we have been attending a committee meeting and I have not had an opportunity to be briefed since that meeting commenced at 2 p.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">On the question of bringing in other air traffic controllers, there are 300 plus air traffic controllers and while some may be available this is not a route I would advocate pursuing.  It would be entirely up to the IAA to decide if it wanted to go down this route but it is not one I would advocate at this stage.  The best route to take would be to get both parties to go to the Labour Court and talk to each other.  I agree with the other statements that were made and I have made a statement on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">On the matter of the damage to our reputation caused by this action, I received a number of telephone calls, one from a person who has spent considerable time, which I know to be true, convincing investors to come into this country to maintain businesses and to create new ones.  He has been successful in many cases.  That person had arranged for more investors to come to this country today but had to tell them that they could not travel here because of the strike.</p>

Notwithstanding the Minister's personal commitment, it is not good enough that the Government has sat idly by and nothing has been done about this.  We will hold the Minister to his commitment on this and will follow up on this with him by way of questions and on the Order of Business because it is essential that we deal with the matter once and for all.

I am sure the Minister would agree that the management of IAA should also use those structures.  We seem to be in a strange period now following the collapse of social partnership talks prior to Christmas.  I would like to address that point.  Additional mechanisms are in place to resolve disputes in such a critical area as this one.  Workers voluntarily make contracts with employers.  I do not share Fine Gael's approach in this area but the stoppages in Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports need not have happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_885">That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion, under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_886">a proposal for a Council Decision on setting up the standing committee on operational cooperation on internal security,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_887">a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 14 December 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The opening up of the EU internal market in the 1990s and other developments that have increased the permeability of internal borders posed a number of problems for the Union and its member states, not least of which was the fact that organised criminal structures set about exploiting these developments.  Subsequent events led to the realisation that terrorists could exploit the greater openness of the EU for their ends.  The imperative, in these circumstances, to protect the citizens of the EU by creating an area of freedom, security and justice, with a high level of security for those citizens, required that law enforcement and judicial authorities should improve their co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Since then there have been numerous initiatives to increase the level of effectiveness of co-operation, including the creation of Eurojust, with its function of improving co-operation in ensuring effective prosecutions, and the European arrest warrant.  Side by side with these have been important developments in information sharing, especially between law enforcement authorities, as a means of increasing the effectiveness of actions against organised crime and terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The member states of the EU face common challenges across the range of areas related to internal security and there is a need to adopt common strategies and co-ordinated EU action to allow us to meet those challenges more effectively.  One such measure, which arises from the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty on 1 December 2009, is the setting up of a standing committee on operational co-operation on internal security.  This committee is established by Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty.  The purpose of the standing committee, which will be known by the French-language acronym COSI, is to ensure that operational co-operation on internal security is promoted and strengthened within the European Union.  The committee will also facilitate the co-ordination of actions taken by the relevant authorities of the member states in this area.  Deputies should be aware that the reference to "internal security" encompasses a range of issues related to public security and safety, covering actions against crime of all sorts, border management, customs co-operation and civil crisis management such as for natural or man-made disasters.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Co-operation in the field of justice and home affairs has become an increasingly important feature of the EU landscape.  The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is a treaty objective of the Union and this has been the over-arching focus of activity in the JHA field, involving activities covering free movement, asylum and immigration policies, and management of Union's external borders.  Close co-operation has also been developed between the national police, judicial and customs authorities in the ongoing fight against crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">A wide range of initiatives have been undertaken and are ongoing at EU level across the spectrum of policy areas relevant to internal security.  Across this range of areas, there is ongoing interaction at operational level between the relevant authorities and services in member states, which allows for increased and more effective cross-border action and also for the development and sharing of best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Many legal instruments in the field of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters have been adopted at EU level, including measures to combat terrorism, trafficking in persons, child pornography, drug trafficking and money laundering.  In addition, Europol and Eurojust have been established in order to support and improve co-operation between the member states in combating serious crimes such as corruption, drug trafficking and terrorism.  The member states are also developing common approaches to the challenges of better managing migration flows into the Union.  Minimum standards and procedures are being set out for asylum seekers.  A European pact on immigration and asylum was adopted in 2008, setting out the principles behind a number of EU laws with the aim of organising legal immigration so that it takes account of the priorities and needs of each EU member state, and also to encourage the integration of immigrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">More effective control of the EU's external borders is also a priority objective in order to tackle illegal immigration.  The FRONTEX agency was set up in 2005 to enhance practical co-operation between the member states in developing better external border security.  The creation of partnerships with the countries of origin and transit of illegal immigration is another important goal.  The aim will be to seek to improve the poor living conditions which may act as a push factor in the countries from which people want to move away.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">The customs services of the EU play an essential role in the fight against international drug-trafficking and related crimes.  The EU drugs strategy, in dealing with illicit drug-trafficking and supply-side enforcement measures, focuses on reducing money laundering, the diversion of precursor chemicals for the manufacture of illegal drugs, and effective co-operation between customs, police and prosecuting authorities in the fight against drug-trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">International co-operation between the various enforcement agencies charged with combating drug-trafficking and related crime is absolutely essential given the cross-border nature of these activities.  Ireland's customs service plays a full part in protecting the European space in co-operation with its counterparts in other member states.  The co-ordination of civil protection actions among member states in response to possible man-made or natural disasters is another important aspect of co-operation at EU level.  A notable area of recent activity in this field has been the agreement of an action plan to enhance chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear security in the EU.  The many actions included in the action plan are aimed at supporting the ongoing efforts of the member states in this field and providing an improved framework for co-ordinated action and co-operation between all those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The proposed Council decision sets out the tasks to be assigned to the new committee.  Its primary purpose, in accordance with the treaty, is to facilitate, promote and strengthen co-ordination of operational actions of member states' competent authorities in the field of internal security, principally police, customs and border protection.  It will also cover, where appropriate, judicial co-operation in criminal matters relevant to this.  The committee will not, however, be involved in conducting operations; these will remain within the remit of the member states.  This is consistent with the mandate set down in Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty to promote and strengthen operational co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Furthermore, COSI will not have a legislative role.  In accordance with the Lisbon treaty arrangements, legislation will be considered by the various Council working parties and will go from them to the committee of permanent representatives to the EU and on to the Council for final adoption.  It will be for each member state to decide on the appropriate representatives to attend meetings.  This will depend to some extent on the subject matter coming before the committee for discussion.  The committee will also have the function of evaluating the efficiency of operational co-operation, identifying possible shortcomings or failures and adopting recommendations to address them.  This is a key aspect in ensuring that actions can be properly targeted and resources can be deployed to the best effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">In addition, COSI will help to ensure consistency of action by Eurojust, Europol and Frontex, representatives of which will be invited to attend meetings of COSI as observers.  The committee will submit reports at regular intervals to the Council on its activities.  The Council will keep national parliaments and the European Parliament informed of the proceedings of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Copies of the proposal were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 14 December 2009.  This Council decision is a measure pursuant to Title V of Part III of the Treaty of Lisbon and is, therefore, a measure to which Ireland may opt-in under Protocol No. 21.  Protocol No. 21 to the Treaty of Lisbon provides that Ireland may opt to take part in the adoption and application of measures which are proposed in regard to the area of freedom, security and justice.  In order for Ireland to exercise that opt-in, the prior approval of the Oireachtas, in accordance with Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution, is required.  With the approval of the Oireachtas, this will be the first measure under the Treaty of Lisbon to which Ireland will opt-in in accordance with Protocol No. 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Members will appreciate that the EU has an important role to play in bringing together the actions of member states aimed at promoting and ensuring the internal security of the European space.  By the same token, Ireland has an important contribution to make to those efforts in co-operation with our fellow EU member states.  Ireland's participation in COSI will enable us to play a full role in developing the necessary co-ordinated action among the member states to contribute to a more secure future for all of the European Union's citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_556">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_903">On behalf of the Fine Gael party, I welcome the introduction of this motion and note that Fine Gael will support it.  It is both interesting and heartening to be working on the implementation of certain aspects of the Lisbon treaty, having waited for so long for it to become part of our domestic law.  In common with other Members, I campaigned vigorously for a "Yes" vote in both Lisbon referendums and was strongly of the view that signing up to Lisbon would be of great assistance to Ireland in many ways, including, as the Minister noted, dealing with the security challenges of the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">While Ireland has chosen an opt-out, by virtue of Protocol No. 21, from the European Union justice and home affairs measures, it rightly has expressed its wish to opt-in to the maximum extent possible.  In this regard, the establishment of COSI, which was provided for under Article 71 of the Lisbon treaty, is a basic measure and Ireland should play a full role in the committee's deliberations and should designate a nominee or nominees with appropriate experience and expertise to participate in the committee's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">COSI has a great deal to offer Ireland in assisting it to identify and meet the standards of international best practice regarding operational matters in the field of internal security.  While it may be regrettable that the committee does not enjoy any mandatory or mandating powers, member states should recognise the value of accepting the committee's periodic recommendations and implementing them as part of their domestic law in an efficient manner as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I assume the committee's regular reports to the Council will focus member states' minds in respect of implementing recommendations, particularly as the Council will, in turn, keep the European Parliament and the national parliaments informed on the proceedings of the committee.  It is absolutely essential to have clear channels concerning the various arrangements or protocols to prevent many of these reports from ending up on rather circuitous routes with different committees from national parliaments to the European Parliament and back again.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The primary role of COSI is to "facilitate, promote and strengthen co-ordination of operational actions of the authorities of ... Member States competent in the field of internal security".  I am particularly pleased that, as the Minister noted, the committee will do more than examine criminal matters such as combating terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, people trafficking and immigration matters, although they will be its primary focus, as it will also have a role in civil protection in emergency situations.  Ireland has had its fair share of civil emergency situations in recent months and ongoing water shortages indicate it still is in the grip of what could be described as an emergency situation.  I understand that COSI is to have an important role to play in evaluating existing measures in member states, as they are set up or equipped, to deal with emergency situations and make appropriate recommendations.  An example might be a recommendation that would suggest or direct as to which agency should play the lead role, should an emergency situation arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Ireland certainly could have done with such an input during the recent flooding and snowfalls, when something of a crisis developed, however short-lived.  My constituency was badly affected by winter flooding and snow.  I refer in particular to the west Offaly region, which was devastated when the River Shannon breached its banks yet again.  Thousands of acres of farmland were destroyed and remain under water to this day.  In recent times, some parts of Offaly have been under water for most of the year due to summer flooding in the months from June to September, inclusive, followed by winter flooding, which as recent experience demonstrates, begins at the end of October and continues right up to March.  The victims of this flooding feel completely isolated and abandoned to their fate.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">During the recent flooding in west Offaly, buildings became uninhabitable and businesses were destroyed.  In places such as Banagher, Shannon Harbour and Shannonbridge, the ground floors of residential houses and businesses were under water for days on end and no agency stepped forward to take control of the situation.  A total of 12 Departments and agencies have a direct interest in the Shannon and I have little doubt but that were COSI to examine the issue, it would discern a clear need for all such agencies to come together to agree a plan for the maintenance of the River Shannon.  While the Office of Public Works should be the lead agency, this does not appear to be the case.  Although the agencies may have different interests, the primary focus and interest that will inform a future strategy must be the protection of individuals, homes and farmland, as well as the capacity to react quickly and coherently.  I am sure that our European partners and counterparts in COSI will be interested to note that a seminal report on maintaining the River Shannon, the Rydell report, has been gathering dust since 1956.  Taking more than 50 years to take the appropriate initiative to deal with a serious situation surely holds the record among member states.  This report remains unimplemented since the mid-1950s, since before either the Acting Chairman or I were born.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">At that time in 1956, my late father was junior Minister with special responsibility in the Department of Agriculture and now, 55 years later, we still have failed to implement any of that important report's recommendations.  If assistance or advice from COSI can be sought, this should be done as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Unfortunately, as an island, Ireland will not benefit as much as will other countries in respect of COSI's recommendations as they may pertain to the pooling of the resources of member states which border one another.  However, I am sure there is great scope for increasing co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland, in respect of which security measures certainly are high on Members' agenda at present.  I am sure this also is the case for our colleagues in COSI and for the agenda of its meetings.  Experts have been warning in recent months that there has been a realignment of terrorists in Northern Ireland with a new group emerging from hardliners among the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA. Between 2007 and 2009 there were more than 750 bomb alerts in the North — an average of one each day.  Although nobody has been killed by the RIRA and the CIRA since the vicious murders of two soldiers and policeman last March, terrorist actions are averaging one a day and, less than two weeks ago, a PSNI officer was critically injured when a bomb was placed under his car.  I am sure all Members will join me in offering our sympathies to Constable Peadar Heffron, wishing him a speedy recovery and sending his family good wishes.  The most recent report of the independent monitoring commission suggested that the threat level is "very serious" and at its highest in six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The Irish representative on COSI will have a valuable input to give in respect of how other countries might deal with terrorist incidents but, equally, as terrorism is a constantly evolving evil, we can learn from member states, for example, Spain and ETA. Another area where COSI can potentially play an important role relates to cross-border crime and illegal drugs.  There have been four gangland gun murders already this year, which can all be traced back to the lucrative business of illegal drug trafficking.  Will the Minister indicate the timeframe for the establishment of COSI, how often it will meet and when we can hope to hear feedback on how its work is progressing?  This is a worthwhile initiative.  I thank the Minister for proceeding with the matter and it will have the support of the Fine Gael Party.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_559">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_914">This measure derives from our responsibilities following the recent finalisation of the Lisbon treaty.  Speaking on behalf of a party that campaigned in favour of the treaty during the recent referendum, I support the Minister's proposal in the motion to enable this standing committee to proceed in Europe, as required.  Nobody in the context of the world we live in today doubts the necessity for co-operation on internal security as broadly defined and encompassed by the motion.  Deputy Flanagan referred to our local difficulties relating to the continued activities of terrorist elements on this island and the appalling wounds inflicted on Constable Peadar Heffron.  I join with the Deputy in extending our sincere hope that he makes a full recovery.  It was an appalling crime, which again highlights the necessity for co-operation between civilised states in attempting to deal with this phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">However, the committee will not only deal with terrorism; it will also deal with, for example, drug trafficking.  The wave of crime that has swept over the country in recent years, which manifests itself in murders on every weekend of our existence nowadays, has its origins in the drug trafficking business.  The necessity for co-operation between the agencies on the supply side to contain the extent and scale of drug trafficking is as obvious as the nose on one's face.  That does not obviate the necessity for us to deal with harm reduction and reducing demand for drugs and it is a matter of concern that some local drugs task forces are being squeezed for funding because they have done immensely good work in reducing demand for drugs.  However, this motion deals with the criminal law and supply issues and the necessity for co-operation between the security and policing forces of different member states.  I agree that it is necessary.  The same applies in respect of the trafficking of persons, money laundering and so on and, therefore, in principle, I am happy to support the motion.  I do not envy the Minister's exciting life dealing with these issues on the European mainland.  It is turgid stuff but it is vital in terms of the safety and security of our people in this jurisdiction and in other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Spanish Presidency has indicated in its schedule that it will give priority to the development of internal security and the promotion of the COSI initiative.  That gives rise to the question of the Government's proposals to prepare us for the imposition of additional duties deriving from the Lisbon treaty.  Part of the merit of the treaty and part of the argument we made at the time was the increasing role for domestic parliaments and the European Parliament.  When one examines measures such as this in the justice and home affairs area, the question immediately arises about the capacity of our Parliament, as currently resourced, to deal properly and adequately with them.  When I saw the belated note on this initially, I wondered whether I should rethink my support for the Lisbon treaty because I found it impenetrable and difficult to appreciate.  There are many similar measures and the Minister adverted to the increase in importance of the justice and home affairs area and the number of complex instruments that require better scrutiny.  It is presumed there will be better scrutiny as a result of the Lisbon treaty than we give it in this Parliament.  I appreciate there is a resources problem and whether this means we should reorient our current resources to enable measures such as this to be properly scrutinised is a matter on which I would like the Minister to respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The motion is part of a pattern followed by him in this area.  We are dealing with a matter in the middle of January that ought to have been put to bed in December.  The first I heard of it was last Monday.  Perhaps that is my fault but I did not know about it at all.  I subsequently unearthed a note sent by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Government Chief Whip on 4 December asking him to put the motion on the agenda as a matter of urgency.  It stated Ireland had held up the previous meeting of the relevant committee in Brussels.  We could not proceed with the decision being promoted by Sweden because Ireland is still outstanding in terms of this Parliament taking the particular steps required in order for us to participate in COSI as envisaged.  That was on 4 December and the requirement was for us to do it prior to Christmas.  However, we did not do so and we are doing it now after the event with minimal scrutiny.  It raises a question in a small Parliament such as this with a limited number of Members who focus on legislative matters as distinct from those who think their priority is to give more attention to daily constituency work.  We need to examine our capacity to scrutinise measures such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I presume from what the Minister stated that the committee will not have power to enter into agreements and that it is a sharing of information committee rather than a decision-making committee.  It will make reports to the Council.  Where will this Parliament come into the network of finding out what the standing committee will do?  Where will it knit into our system, whether through the Parliament proper or the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights?  How do we keep abreast of what is going on?  May I presume that this has been run past the Data Protection Commissioner and that he is satisfied that it is compliant and meets the requirements that he would wish.  I am happy to support the measure.  I recognise the necessity for enhanced co-operation in the area of security as broadly defined and I am happy to give our assent to the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_919">Ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil toisc nach raibh mé anseo nuair a thosaigh an tAire ag labhairt.  Mar gheall ar sin, b'fhéidir go bhfuil roinnt de na ceisteanna atá le cur agam freagartha aige cheana, ach measaim nach bhfuil.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Any measure that promotes better co-operation and greater mutual recognition between member states of the European Union can be positive if the underlying tenet of it is the promotion not of either human or state security but both.  The European Union project and the free movement of people and goods between member states have presented a host of challenges with regard to the security and integrity of external and internal borders.  The only way we can effectively deal with the subject of security while maintaining such an open relationship with other nations in the EU is through the development of the concept of human security alongside multilateral co-operation and effective information sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">Regrettably, much of what passes as security in the EU is an enhancement of the fortress Europe concept rather than seeing that no matter how high barriers are built unless the underlying causes of poverty, exclusion, inequality and the denial of national and human rights are addressed, conflict will persist and insecurity will exist.  The concentration on the type of security that we have to date increases insecurity in the long run and possibly in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">With the passing of the Lisbon treaty at the second attempt, this State signed up to the establishment of this committee.  Under the terms of the treaty the committee was intended to ensure operational co-operation by facilitating co-ordination of the action of member states' competent authorities.  Issues relating to the working, philosophy and accountability of the committee have not been fully addressed and this motion should not be passed without a fuller debate on its remit and the drift towards more EU competency in the area of justice and home affairs.  I understand that we are behind on this but that is not an excuse to rush through such a major change in European oversight, co-operation and sharing of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">I wish to take this opportunity to express some of the concerns we have as a party and that others have shared with me about the adoption of the motion and the formation of the standing committee.  What is the remit and function of the proposed standing committee?  The Lisbon treaty stated that the committee would co-ordinate member states' relevant authorities but it does not state whether this means it will be a purely technical operational brief or whether it will also have some type of legislative function.  Therefore, this has the potential to lead to a conflict of interest, especially if the committee is accountable to itself or to the Council with regard to legislation governing its practical operational functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">With this in mind, it is important that we oppose any move to bestow on this committee a legislative function now or in the future.  Its remit should be defined and limited to having a technical function to co-ordinate the efforts of the relevant authorities in the areas of prevention and combatting international crime and terrorism, and the co-ordination of intelligence exchange.  I do not know whether the Minister can guarantee at this stage that this is its full remit and nothing more.  All legislative functions should remain with national parliaments and, where it has competence, the EU Council should also deal with issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Concerns have been expressed that the process of establishing the remit and operational outlook of the committee took place behind closed doors and there is a lack of direction on this in the Lisbon treaty because the pertinent articles do not specify it.  Many believe that the vagueness of the wording in the treaty would allow the committee in time to develop into the equivalent of an EU home office or, in theory, ministry without proper democratic control or even a debate on its future decisions.  Some even go so far as to express concern that this is a gradual move towards a full-scale home office with authority over member states' police and security services and all that entails.  This is the big brother conspiracy theory.  It is not my theory and I do not agree with those who believe it but there can be some justification for conspiracy theorists because often they are not too far from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">One must consider the history of the agencies and governments involved in this field and the capabilities of the information systems we are discussing.  They are Europol, Interpol and the Schengen security database, SIRENE.  There is the potential that it could be abused or misused.  All decisions relating to the establishment of the standing committee must therefore be agreed by national parliaments to ensure greater legitimacy and that it does not move towards that securocrat stream and the big brother theory.  The possible lack of openness and transparency in key decision-making by EU institutions was one of the main concerns expressed by the people of this country on both occasions that ratification of the Lisbon treaty was being debated.  We must be vigilant and oppose anything that would undermine the required move towards transparency and accountability in the workings of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">We are also concerned that the overall policy of the European Union towards internal security is unsatisfactory.  My party believes that at present an EU strategy on security is ill-defined.  There is too much focus on military and policing measures as the main means of promoting security within the EU.  This type of thinking ignores the reality that deprivation, poverty, inequality and injustice are the driving force behind many of the problems that the EU will be required to address.  Many of these underlying problems have led to internal and external threats to the EU.  Offences such as people trafficking, illegal immigration, theft and fraud often stem from poverty and the lack of opportunity, and a lack of resources in underdeveloped areas, as well as from a view that the EU is a land of plenty.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">We would like to see a comparable amount of the vast resources the EU intends to spend on military equipment, border security and other controls diverted to Third World development projects, improving the standard of living for those in countries that were previously raped and pillaged by their former colonial masters.  Many of these former colonial powers are now EU member states, and I believe that the EU will suffer the consequences of the evils of its imperialist member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The comprehensive strategy to combat the root causes of crime and anti-EU terrorism must be an important part of any strategy to promote security within the EU.  One of our concerns is with the over-reliance on military and policing solutions, which could further alienate the very people who have been marginalised and make the EU a greater target for those extremists who wish to perpetrate acts of violence against it.  The rise of international terrorism in the past decade has been seen largely to be fuelled by inequality and injustice in world politics.  Unresolved issues such as the illegal war in Iraq, the plight of the Palestinians, the occupation of Afghanistan and the failure of developed nations to deal with the problems of poverty in the Third World have become emotive.  They are justifications for some groups and individuals to engage in those activities.  Focusing on military and policing solutions to cope with the potential terrorist threat, without also putting appropriate funds and efforts into dealing with the underlying problems, could further alienate those people.  This could have the effect of making European countries a greater target.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">If the same amount of effort, time and resources were spent on combating the causes of crime, we would be in a much better and safer place.  I call for a debate in this House and across the EU on the concept of human security as it has evolved and as it has been promoted by the likes of Kofi Annan and many others in the UN.  In conjunction with human security, state security can develop and we would be in a much safer place than we are at the moment.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_931">I thank the Deputies for the broad cross-party support for this motion.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh spoke about external border security.  Having been Minister for Foreign Affairs and now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am acutely aware of the desire of our member state colleagues, particularly driven by Ireland, of the need to address some of the difficulties with inward illegal immigration into the broader EU.  I am also aware of the desire to try to stop some of the root causes involved for people from Africa and elsewhere to migrate into Europe.  An amazing effort has been made over the years by EU member states to address some of the difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The Deputy quoted Kofi Annan and he was correct in what he said.  However, people like Kofi Annan are not naive enough to think that we were not only able to deal with the ills of some of the difficult situations in Africa and elsewhere without police and military co-operation.  People like Kofi Annan made suggestions about the requirement whereby the EU should contribute to battle groups in order to encourage co-operation between member states.  At any given time, troops from several member states could go into areas of conflict in order to bring some security and balance back to those communities.  That has worked well.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The Stockholm programme was adopted by the European Council last December and it sets out an agenda for building progress in the justice and home affairs area over the next five years.  One of the aspects of the Stockholm programme was to develop internal security strategy within the EU.  The definition of internal security is not restricted to law enforcement, but also relates to how we can co-operate to address some of the natural and man-made disasters.  Ireland is very conscious of this at EU level.  The internal security refers to those disasters within the confines of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The mains tasks of COSI are to ensure operational co-operation and co-ordination, to evaluate the general direction and efficiency of the co-operation and to identify possible shortcomings and failures, and to recommend measures to address them.  It has no operational or legislative role.  Deputy Flanagan referred to the need to streamline working procedures within the justice and home affairs area.  There is a commitment to re-organise the working groups under the Lisbon treaty, and this motion is part of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Deputy Rabbitte welcomed the motion.  He suggested that there is a need for greater co-ordination at EU level, and this is an effort to do that.  The Deputy asked why the motion was brought forward now, rather than before the Christmas recess.  I understand this is due to the work of the committee and to the busy schedule of the House before Christmas.  Given that the first meeting of COSI is not until 12 February, it was felt it could be left over until after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The motion specifically provides that the European Council will keep national parliaments informed of the proceedings at committee level.  It will be up to the Oireachtas committee here to inquire from time to time as to what is on the committee's agenda.  This is a fulfilment of one of the commitments of the Lisbon treaty.  It was often said during debates that the treaty was difficult to understand, but Article 71 is quite easy to understand.  It is clear that it is a standing committee to ensure that the operation and co-operation of internal security is promoted within the EU.  This motion is a fulfilment of that.  It must get parliamentary scrutiny before it can finally be adopted and before the committee can meet.  I thank the Members for their co-operation and understanding in passing this motion.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_563">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_939">In December last, at the time of the flooding, I was interrupted mid-stream, as it were.  Since then, much water — and snow, ice, grit and meltwater besides — has flowed under the bridge.  The vagaries of the weather and climate notwithstanding, a common theme to emerge is that proper planning is crucial to allow us to withstand the extremes of weather and climate.  We have much to do to ensure people buy into the idea of proper planning and our planning authorities provide good models for development in their respective areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Over the past 30 years, through the boom years and beyond, the options in housing have been limited essentially to three, namely, a semi-detached house, an apartment or flat in the centre of a town or one-off house.  The quality of design was poor, the quality of energy control was diabolical and little or nothing was done to improve building standards or the planning framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">As I was saying before being interrupted by the Christmas recess, not only must we improve the quality of the county and city development plans, local area plans, regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy, we must join them together in a much more coherent and organised way.  A local area plan should not be in conflict with the national spatial strategy or regional planning guidelines.   While it may sound abstract to speak in these terms, we have had sufficient evidence in the past five or ten years of significant developments being built without rhyme or reason, other than padding developers' pockets.  A substantial amount of the property which will fall into the hands of the National Asset Management Agency is indicative of the problem of bad planning or <i>laissez-faire</i> planning where county managers allowed people to build whatever and wherever they wanted.  In response to this problem, the Minister, in this Bill, seeks to push the boat out by increasing standards in planning and, specifically, the zoning aspects of county and city development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">One of the positive features of the Bill is the requirement it imposes on city and county councils, irrespective of what stage their development plans have reached, to revisit the plan within a year to ensure it conforms to the core strategy.  The core strategy is tight in that it poses the question as to what precisely is needed in the development plan in terms of housing, employment and social facilities.  I expect planning to be much sharper and more focused as a result.  Weather woes and their impact on communities over the past couple of months drew greater attention to the need to be much more careful about what we plan and where we plan it.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">Before Christmas, I had a chat with one of my colleagues from the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, about a small town which I will not name.  Residents were faced with the prospect of a major international food retailer seeking to build a large supermarket outside the town, rather than in its centre.  The map I am holding shows a splodge of greenery with the town at its centre.  The red marking, the site of the proposed development, is not in the town centre but outside it.  The fear and concern of retailers in the town is that the old town centre will suffer once this large box development opens up beside the bypass on the edge of the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">The problem I highlight, which is evident in almost every town, boils down to the decisions taken by city, town and county councillors during the development plan process.  If one rezones every green field outside a town, one should not be surprised when big box retailers propose to build beside the motorway rather than in the town centre.  The downside of this development is that businesses which have been the lifeblood of a town for generations will close down as a result of the car dominated planning policies which allow economies of scale to kill off town centres.  We saw this process in England during the Thatcher era when an absence of planning resulted in people becoming much more car dependent.  We have seen a similar trend in France in the past 30 years and we are seeing it again in Ireland much more recently.  If ever there was an argument for being careful about what one zones and rezones, it is the example of small towns being killed off by a lack of planning and the failure to think through the consequences of councillors' actions in rezoning excessive amounts of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Within one year of the Bill becoming law, planning authorities must revisit their development plans and ensure they conform to the core strategy they must produce.  This is a good development.  One must look no further than my county, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, to see how a development plan is being formulated.  I have significant problems with the actions of councillors who are increasing the amount of land they wish to rezone and raising the cap on the size of some shopping centres proposed or partially developed in the county.  We have a choice between allowing more shops to be built on green field sites or ensuring the existing towns of Stillorgan, Dundrum and Dún Laoghaire are revitalised.  If we continue to build big box developments on the outskirts of our towns and the edges of the M50 and south eastern motorway, the old towns of Dún Laoghaire, Dundrum, Stillorgan and Cherrywood will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">I say to my colleagues across the Chamber in the Fine Gael Party and Labour Party as well as Independents that we must consider what type of a county we want to see in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown in the coming years.  Perhaps Deputy Olivia Mitchell will have a good discussion with her colleagues on the county council about the type of planning they wish to see in the county.  We face a stark choice between urban sprawl and consolidation.  For my part, as a member of the Green Party, I believe we need consolidation on the periphery and outskirts of Dublin as we will otherwise become even more car dependent.  This argument is not only theoretical but practical.  It is also strong in terms of its social aspects because further urban sprawl will result in people without access to a car becoming remote from shops, pubs and, therefore, the lifeblood of their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">I attended a workshop this morning held under the auspices of the Dublin Transportation Office, which has been renamed the Dublin Transport Authority and subsequently subsumed into the National Transport Authority.  As a result, we will have a new transport authority in Dublin.  This embryonic organisation made a presentation in the Davenport Hotel, which noted that the transport demand of those living in the periphery of the greater Dublin area will be seven times greater than that of those who live near the centre of the city.  This has been stunningly obvious to me for many years.  One uses seven times as much energy for transport requirements if one lives in the rural hinterland compared to the city centre.  This should concentrate the mind.  We are not saying that people must live in Dublin city centre or Dún Laoghaire but in planning policy terms we should produce much better developments in town and city centres.  We need to move away from the choices identified earlier of the small apartment, the semi-detached house or the one-off house.  We must improve the build quality of those developments, improve the quality of design and give people more options.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">All Deputies in this Chamber have travelled abroad and we have seen the gracious living in the centre of Amsterdam or Copenhagen and the good recent development one sees in parts of southern and northern Europe.  We should look towards those models of development not in a prescriptive way, but in making it easier and giving people more choices.  For far too long, people have been very restricted in their choices of where to live, shop, work or relax.  Much of this was due to the overly strong influence of developers on the options available to people.  The State should push the boat out to offer more options.  This Bill does that and I am supportive of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">I am dwelling particularly on the core strategy and the need to re-examine the zonings that were too flaithiúlach during the Celtic tiger years.  The recession has concentrated our minds on the kind of Ireland we want to have.  Suburban sprawl is not the way forward.  High-quality, mixed-use development will make for better communities, which is what I want to support.  Many other aspects of this Bill are worthy of support.  I was heartened by the discussion with Deputy O'Hanlon, who starkly illustrated the choices in counties around Ireland.  If we rezone every last patch of land, we should not be surprised if the big box supermarkets move to the periphery and kill off town centres.  Choices must be made in my area, Dún Laoghaire, to ensure the county town of Dún Laoghaire is revitalised.  This Bill will give us the toolkit to make the changes that will make Ireland more sustainable in the best interests of our communities.</p>

I assure Deputy Cuffe that my colleagues in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council do not need lectures on sustainable development.  They recognise, as do many, that if further development is required in our lifetime it must be in support of existing communities, putting in the infrastructure they need.  Development in the future must be done in a concentrated way so that we limit the development footprint as much as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_952">Notwithstanding the need for belated reform, I was shocked by the content of the legislation because of its command and control nature in what is proposed as a new planning and development framework.  I do not deny for a minute the need for a new framework, the need to learn from mistakes of the past, to prevent the recurrence of the abuses of the past, to equip the planning authorities to deal with very different problems and to equip the planning authorities to face the challenges of the future.  I do not pretend that finding a new planning framework is easy — it is not easy to find one that will meet with universal approval.  Our history, our near obsessive devotion to land and property and our inbuilt expectation of capital appreciation in property, passed down from generation to generation, combine to create resistance to change and generate strong and varying views on what constitutes good planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">As a member of the local authority, I used to think I had seen it all but it was not until I came to this House and met rural Deputies that I realised the difference between what is considered good planning in Dublin and what is considered good planning in rural Ireland.  What Dublin considers utterly reprehensible is considered good planning in the country and <i>vice versa</i>.  Within council areas there are often differing views on what constitutes good planning.  Some believe the emphasis should be on jobs, social gain and community gain while others believe the environment is all-important.  The battle is over which should take priority.  Is good planning more important than the other considerations or is helping jobs, people and communities more important?  The truth is that any settlement policy will involve compromises.  If we had no people we could have a sustainable environment because there would be very little degradation of the environment.  However, we do have people so the objective must be to find the least unsustainable policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Whatever the difficulties, the solution is not to have ministerial micromanagement of every local area plan and development plan.  This is what the legislation effectively suggests.  This goes against the concept of subsidiarity and everything the Government says it aspires to for local government.  It goes against the concept of devolution and self-government and, most of all, it is contrary to everything the Green Party has said about local government even though this Bill is published by a Green Party Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Green Party has always promoted the reverse of these measures.  The Green Party wanted local government at the micro level and at local authority meetings I have often heard them refer to local government at street level, the concept of the self-sufficient commune.  Such control from the Minister is a million miles from that concept.  Where does the new departure, of centralising the most basic local decisions at Government level in the hands of the Minister of the day, come from?  I do not understand how this could come from a Green Party Minister who has always articulated different ideas.  What arrogance would make a Minister think he can know enough about every single local authority, the local conditions and circumstances in order to dictate a better future for every hamlet throughout the country?  Perhaps the current Minister knows enough and I would not criticise him.  Even if he does know enough to do a good job for everyone, could the same be said for every Minister with responsibility for the environment we have ever had?  Would the current Minister want those past Ministers to have had absolute power as he suggests for himself?  Is he confident it is a good idea to give the power to Ministers in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I agree with the Minister that we must have a settlement hierarchy and that national plans and regional plans must be broadly consistent with the local development plans and local area plans.  It is a great leap from that point to saying that it can only be achieved by having county managers make local draft development plans, which can only be amended by the Minister of the day.  It makes a complete nonsense of local government and devalues local knowledge and aspirations as well as the input that only local people can have.  It is impossible to know local conditions and to understand the dynamics of the local area or a town, no matter how wonderful the Minister.  It is a complex social, historical and cultural issue.  The best governed countries in the world have the best and strongest local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The Minister refers to consultation at pre-drafting stage.  The Acting Chairman was a member of a local authority and he knows what the public thinks of local consultation.  Regardless of how well-meaning the concept of local consultation is, as far as the public is concerned it is a farce, in effect, in terms of bringing about change in the concept or principle of what is being proposed.  People feel that it might change the detail, but will not change the principle.  Rightly or wrongly, the public regards the whole public consultation process — what used to be Part 10 but is now Part 8 — as a means for bureaucrats to tell the public what they plan to do anyway.  The existence of a process of public consultation will not help to bring about much change.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">God knows the local authorities have made mistakes in their planning.  I confess I made such errors in the past.  Many of those mistakes were largely due to the complete absence of a national spatial vision.  The Minister was right in what he said in that regard.  The national spatial strategy was eventually produced quite late in the Celtic tiger cycle, unfortunately.  It was really a joke of a plan.  Everyone knew it was hugely political.  It had something for everybody in the audience.  There was not a hamlet in the county that was not going to be developed.  As the plan was based on a scattergun approach, it produced scattergun development.  Such development escalated after the publication of the national spatial strategy.  The then Minister agreed a plan that encouraged the kind of development that we are now saying must never be allowed to happen again, as it has caused so many problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">The amazing thing is that the Green Party criticised the national spatial strategy when it was published, but it is now proposing a new framework that is based on coherence between the national spatial strategy, which is hugely flawed, and all other plans.  That does not make sense to me.  If the Minister is to pursue this framework, I plead with him to revisit the national spatial strategy.  Having produced a hugely flawed strategy, the Government went on to ignore it completely.  The only good aspect of it was the provision for certain urban areas to be designated as gateways or hubs of development that would support the local network of towns, villages and the rural countryside.  It was planned to locate the main supporting infrastructure — the large hospitals, libraries, water works, buildings, development and transport facilities — in the gateways, but that never happened.  The investment made during the Celtic tiger years was not focused on the gateways — it was based on a scattergun approach.  The gateways did not get priority investment.  There was never any hope that the hubs which were originally envisaged to give communities the support they required would be developed.  The reality is that it will not now happen in this generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">I wish to speak about the regional planning guidelines that were given to local authorities in poor old Dublin.  Deputy Cuffe spoke about the guidelines in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I was a member of that authority when the Dublin local authorities were asked to build houses to meet the population targets that had been set for them.  The authorities were promised that if they did so, suitable infrastructural investment in schools, buses, sports facilities, hospitals, libraries and other necessary facilities would follow from the Government in support of new communities.  Communities throughout Dublin are suffering because that never materialised.  Young people have to travel ten or 15 miles from their communities to go to school in the city centre.  Secondary schools are a precious commodity in my constituency.  Primary schools were promised, but some children are lucky to have prefabs.  In some cases, they do not even have prefabs.  Little kids are travelling out of the community to get places in primary schools.  The facilities that were promised are not coming.  The development levies that might have been gathered are not materialising.  Many of the levies pertaining to existing developments will not be paid and there will be no new developments for some years to come.  Many communities have been completely abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">Consistency is a two-way process.  If we want local authority plans to be consistent with national plans, the Government must follow through on its national plans by investing the necessary funds, which should be funnelled to where they were promised.  There will be no incentive for local authority plans to be consistent with a national spatial strategy if the latter strategy is not being implemented.  The Government's failure to meet its obligations made local authorities try to do what they could on their own.  I have spoken to many councillors throughout the country who saw it as their obligation to try to save their local areas because nobody else was doing it.  When every authority works on its own, there is no consistency and no coherence.  That is what gave us bad planning.  It was Government policy to allow the construction of hotels in God-forsaken places.  They never had any chance of being sustainable.  When one drives around the country, it is tragic to see housing estates that were built on the edges of old villages.  In some cases, the estate is capable of housing three times the original population of the village.  There was never any reason for the local population to grow in a manner that would produce sufficient demand for such houses.  It is a tragedy and a classic example of how not to develop rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">If there is no coherence between the various plans, there is no incentive for local authorities to follow the national plan.  Many councillors have started to see national plans as having no reality beyond the day they are announced with great fanfare in Dublin.  To put it quite simply, population and jobs will follow the infrastructure.  If there is no infrastructure, who can blame rudderless local authorities for doing what they see as the best thing for their local areas?  I agree with the section of the Bill that calls for consistency with transport plans.  No development should take place anywhere in the country unless there is a clear transport plan for that area.  Climate change has made that critical.  The transport plans that have been presented never came to pass, however.  Transport 21, which has been largely abandoned, did not have more than patchy coherence across the country.  According to the national spatial strategy, by contrast, almost every town in the country was to be developed.  I do not disagree with what the Minister wants to achieve, but I disagree with any effort to try to achieve it by diktat.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The major flaw in his approach is that we do not know whether the required consistency between ministerial plans and ministerial actions will exist.  The Government ignored the national spatial strategy it produced.  If this Bill is to mean anything, the spatial strategy will have to be revised and implemented.  One of my big problems with this legislation is that its whole tone is contrary to the objective of strengthening local government and transparency.  I do not think any Minister, regardless of who he or she is, should dictate what happens at local level.  When a national plan has been put in place, one should expect local authorities to comply with it.  Indeed, sanctions can be put in place to ensure that happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I would like to mention a couple of other issues.  I do not want to be completely negative because I support certain aspects of this Bill, such as those allowing for the extension of planning permission and for greater clarity about the taking in charge of estates.  I am not happy about the idea of allowing local authorities to impose levies so that schools are provided.  When newly married couples buy their first house, they should not have to pay for schools to be constructed.  That is what this provision involves, in effect.  I am aware of hapless people in my local area who bought apartments and are now in negative equity with no local facilities.  They overpaid for their properties because developers felt they would have to pay development levies.  Those levies were not paid, in many cases.  Some of them were paid, but many of them will never be paid.  The developers in question are with NAMA now, or will be shortly.  I do not believe these levies should be extended to schools.  If there is one thing kids are entitled to, it is a school and I think the State should provide it.  In any event, levies are a discredited currency at local level.  They played a part in the uncontrolled building frenzy and were ultimately paid by the hapless house buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I would like to raise some other aspects of the Bill in the few minutes remaining to me.  I have written to the Minister about Part V housing being built in areas that are separate to the developments for which planning permission is being sought.  There is no transparency in that regard.  The Minister acknowledged my letter and assured me he would respond to the issues in advance of the publication of this Bill but as I have heard nothing further, I ask him to respond.  The lack of transparency is contrary to the notion that people should be involved in the planning process and be aware of what was happening in their areas.  People purchased houses in what they assumed were private developments only to discover subsequently that they were surrounded by public housing.  I support completely the Part V provisions and it is perfectly acceptable that the proportion of housing constructed in my area under that Part was 20% but when the proportion increases to 40% or 60% the intention of the provisions are unacceptably undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Anybody living in an urban area would be aware of the increasing problem of oversized trees in urban gardens.  Where people live in close proximity, some sort of control is needed over trees.  They can cause more damage than walls or buildings because they keep growing.  If I may be excused the pun, this is an old chestnut.  I ask the Minister to follow the example of most other countries by introducing some form of regulation.  One must take account of loss of sunlight as well as the potential damage to adjoining buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">In the context of the property collapse, it is urgent that some way be found to complete estates and other developments which were intended to be operated by management companies.  In some cases, lifts and staircase were operated by management companies while open areas were to be taken in charge by local authorities.  Other developments were to be managed entirely by management companies but many have not yet been completed by developers.  It was previously assumed that a bond would cover completion of such developments but it has since emerged that local authorities are not entitled to seek bonds to guarantee completion.  The fall-out is that nobody is responsible for completing developments or finishing paths and landscaping.  The law as it stands appears to place the new owners of these developments in breach of planning permission.  I am not sure whether NAMA will assume the obligations of the planning permission when it takes over some of these developments.</p>

          <p eId="para_969">If Deputy Kelly arrives in the Chamber, I will share time with him.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is intended to update the provisions of earlier Planning Acts.  It will support economic renewal and promote sustainable development by ensuring that the planning system complements and supports infrastructural development around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">I agree with Deputy Mitchell's contention that trees cause significant problems throughout the city.  Dublin City Council had to dig up a number of cherry trees because of the damage they caused to footpaths along the quays.  Given the height of some of these trees, they would be refused planning permission if they were buildings.  In urban settings, it is important that the size of trees is appropriate to the areas in which they grow.  Some people think they are living in Glenveagh National Park when they plant their trees.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Deputy Cuffe raised an interesting issue on rezoning of land outside town centres for supermarkets.  This may be not as noticeable in Dublin and other cities but it certainly has an impact.  Dublin City Council has battled with Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council over the construction of Dundrum Shopping Centre, which has had a significant impact on the city centre as a retail destination.  Dundrum clearly has its attractions but it has also sucked people from other shopping centres and the city centre.  This suited Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council because it brought vastly increased revenues which could be used to keep councillors and managers happy by making it easier to fund various schemes.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment received a number of submissions from city and town traders whose businesses are being suffocated by large shopping centres on the outskirts of urban areas.  Town centres cannot compete with the attraction of free and easy parking at these centres.  Small traders, many of whom have operated business in town centres for generations, have been badly affected.  This has been permitted by councillors in every local authority and we must also examine our own role as public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The Bill before us will go some way towards dealing with the rezoning decisions made in the past several years by introducing a more robust and strategic planning system.  Over the past decade, Ireland experienced an unprecedented property boom which drove demand to such an extent that planning permission was granted in completely unsuitable areas.  In Milltown in my constituency, permission was sought for a development in an area which anybody could tell is subject to flooding.  I hope the local authority does not allow that to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Over the past several months, we have seen pictures of inappropriate developments in rural areas.  Dublin's big advantage is that it does not have an extensive area of open land for development.  Dublin City Council has to build upwards or off-load people to the outskirts of the city.  We have all heard about the housing developments built on lands that were prone to flooding or without sufficient access to essential amenities.  This legislation will protect against that type of disjointed and fractured planning in the future and will ensure Ireland moves towards a more co-ordinated and holistic planning process in which the macro consequences of planning decisions are carefully considered and which supports and informs the targets outlined in the Government's national spatial strategy.  For example, the Bill provides that the relevant city or county manager must demonstrate how local development plans comply with the national spatial strategy and must ensure that topics such as growth scenarios, transport plans and rural development are taken into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Correct planning decisions are pivotal to Ireland's future development and will feed into other policy areas such as transport, environment and community development.  This is supported in the Government's action plan Smarter Travel — A Sustainable Transport Future, which outlines the pivotal role spatial and transport planning will play in tackling urban sprawl and, by default, the challenge we face in regard to carbon emissions.  Under the Bill, local development plans must contain mandatory objectives for the promotion of sustainable settlement and transportation strategies in urban and rural areas and outline the measures that will lead to reduced emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Section 23 is a timely and sensible measure in the context of the financial difficulties being experienced by many people.  As I understand it, the current situation is that planning permission is only extended in cases where substantial works have been carried out prior to the expiration of that permission.  However, this provision means that planning permission may be extended in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out.  This will be allowed to happen if there are commercial, economic or technical considerations.  For example, in the current climate many people seeking to develop or extend property are under financial constraints which may be beyond their control.  This provision will help applicants to plan ahead and to have some certainty within the planning process.  It will afford those applicants who cannot immediately proceed with a project as planned the opportunity to proceed when their personal circumstances improve or certain technical difficulties are ironed out without having to go through the entire planning process again.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">It is crucial that the planning process complements the national spatial strategy.  I welcome sections 24 and 25 which have regard to the need to develop infrastructure in the designated gateway towns outlined in the strategy.  The development of these locations in coming years and their projected population growth means there must be continued progress in providing them with the infrastructure necessary to support vibrant and sustainable communities.  To facilitate this concept, the Bill grants local authorities much greater flexibility to use development levies, where needed, on a broader range of infrastructure such as school sites, broadband provision and flood relief works.  The wider distribution of development levies is particularly welcome.  Rather than introducing additional levies the Bill provides local authorities with greater flexibility and control over the distribution of existing levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The Bill provides that amendments to development plans will now require, rather than a simple majority, the support of two thirds of the total membership of a planning authority.  This is a welcome and sensible move which will require support from a significant bloc for any given proposal.  Moreover, it will reduce the scope for the lobbying of particular individuals or groups.  The measures in the Bill are progressive and well thought out.  They will result in a fairer, more constructive and more considered planning process.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterKellyFF" eId="spk_569">
          <from>Deputy Peter Kelly</from>
          <p eId="para_978">I am pleased to welcome my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House for this debate.  He is doing an excellent job in his portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Planning law is currently based on the Planning and Development Act 2000 which consolidated and modernised the planning system.  This was followed by the launch by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of the national spatial strategy in 2002.  Regional authorities have been responsible for regional planning guidelines since 2004, and development plans and local plans are made by planning authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The original purpose of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was, as stated in its Title, to "provide, in the interests of the common good, for proper planning and sustainable development."  However, in the past ten years we have witnessed a litany of poor planning decisions and chronic over-zoning.  The Bill before us today will once and for all put an end to the bad planning that has seen a deterioration in the quality of life of those living in housing estates without facilities, schools or proper public transport.  There is no doubt that planning has been at times inconsistent with national, regional and local planning guidelines.  This Bill will put an end to that by ensuring there is greater coherence between national, regional and local guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 is part of the Government's commitment to the development of a smart economy.  The legislation introduces several key changes to the planning code with the principal aim of ensuring proper planning at local level, supporting economic renewal and promoting sustainable development into the future.  It will ensure greater consistency between a local authority's development plan, the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines and ministerial directives.  The legislation provides that any changes to a county development plan must include an indicator as to how the plan is consistent with the regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.  This strengthening of the status of regional planning guidelines and the role of regional authorities in the preparation of development plans is welcome.  Their input on key issues will be hugely important and will ensure a cohesive relationship between local planning and regional planning guidelines.  I take this opportunity as a former member of the Midland Regional Authority to pay tribute to the former chief executive officer, Mr. Jim Stone, his staff and all the members of the authority for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">This legislation will ensure that future development takes place at the right time, in the right place and at the right pace to allow for the necessary infrastructure to be built.  Most important, the Bill will greatly strengthen local democracy and accountability and provide greater transparency for the public in the planning process.  An important provision in this regard is that two thirds of councillors, rather than a simple majority, must approve the county development plan.  It also ensures that the powers bestowed on councillors are exercised in a responsible way in accordance with good planning practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">To ensure greater transparency, amendments to a draft development or local area plan which have been the subject of public consultation can only be changed now in minor respects.  Previously, land zoning was often introduced in the latter stages of a development plan.  However, this new rule will ensure councillors are forbidden from making any last minute changes.  In addition, following the public consultation process, any further changes will be subject to the two thirds majority rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I welcome the increased role of the Minister who will have greater legal responsibility under the new procedures.  One of the most welcome aspects of the Bill is that which provides for greater powers to deal with so-called rogue developers.  That will enable local authorities to refuse planning permission to applicants who have been convicted of serious breaches of planning legislation or who have been involved in an unauthorised development.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">In the news yesterday, it was reported that an estimated 300,000 houses are empty and approximately 200 ghost estates are scattered around the country.  I very much hope that those developers who have littered our country with ghost estates and caused heartache for hundreds of home owners will be prevented from acquiring planning permission in the future.  We must not only ensure an end to ghost estates but we must ensure that we never again have what Frank McDonald in <i>The Irish Times</i> has referred to as “tenements for the 21st century” in Dublin city centre.  The legislation must take those kinds of developers into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">I referred to developers who are guilty of abandoning home owners in ghost estates with no possibility of being able to sell their homes.  On the other hand, there are also many honourable developers who would like to complete the developments they have started or who have been granted planning permission.  Unfortunately, at the moment the main obstacle in their way is a lack of credit.  As a result, I very much welcome the extension of planning permission for a further five years as outlined in the Bill.  That provision has been well received, given the current slump in the property market.  The takeover of billions in property loans by NAMA is imminent.  I hope that will result in a greater supply of credit for those developers.  The extension of planning permission will further aid the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I do not agree with one aspect of the Bill, namely, section 28 which empowers An Bord Pleanála to reduce the quorum for its meetings from three to two members.  That is being done to increase the efficiency of the business of the board in terms of handling a backlog of appeals.  I suggest that this reduction to two members could slow down the process and result in greater indecision.  With the number of appeals down dramatically due to the recession, there is no need to reduce the quorum.  I wish to see the Bill progressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_570">
          <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_988">I warn the Deputy who is due to speak after me that I will not use my 20 minutes.  I will not speak on regional guidelines, spatial strategies or local development plans.  I will focus on one issue, namely, one-off planning and the service that is provided to the public when it comes to local authorities and the planning process.  I have read what the Minister said in his Second Stage speech.  I accept that the Bill is an attempt to formalise and delineate the roles and relationships that exist between county and city managers, planners, councillors and, most importantly, the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The Bill refers to improving the quality of individual planning decisions and introducing greater coherence in the planning process.  It mandates that a proposed or draft direction would be issued regarding local area plans in the first instance to seek local views before any final direction is issued.  Interestingly enough, it also refers to the efficient use of taxpayers' money.  Some might say the Bill micromanages planning matters throughout the country from the Minister's office.  However, it is a genuine attempt to clear up certain ambiguities in the planning process and to clarify the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved, be it the councillor, official or member of the public.  The reality is that to date the interpretation of planning Acts and how they were implemented on a daily basis has almost always been the realm of officials and management in local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">As a former member of a local authority I always felt there was an unequal relationship between councillors and the arguments they made on planning matters and the policies that were and continue to be forced through by the manager and his or her officials.  In other words, they would pretend to listen to the member but then they did what they wanted.  An issue arose in Waterford recently that reminded me of just that, namely, what some see as the blatant insistence of officials in getting their own way in planning matters, to the detriment in some cases of the public, over and above the genuine concerns of elected officials in the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">I would not speak on this matter were it not for the fact that a councillor, namely, Liam Brazil, has been systematically prevented from raising an issue of public importance relating to planning on several occasions in the council chamber to which he was elected.  That has been going on since the end of 2009.  The issue that has arisen relates to site visits and the pre-planning process in Waterford, and the attempt by Waterford County Council management to limit site visits.  Some have described it as an insignificant issue, but I disagree with that.  The measure would, first, adversely affect the public by limiting direct access to planners.  Second, it would make the entire process potentially far more expensive for the public.  Third, it would duplicate the administrative role of officials in the local authority.  Fourth, it encapsulates an attitude prevalent with some officials in management that they know best no matter what.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">My comments and criticisms are directed at the management of Waterford County Council.  On occasion I have tangled with Waterford County Council and members of Fianna Fáil have used it as a stick to beat me with and suggested that I was making a direct attack on the employees of Waterford County Council.  I am not; I am directing my criticism at senior management in Waterford County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Aspects of the Bill make sense but the Minister should take a look at the basic day to day operations of local authorities and how management deals with the public in the area of planning.  The general interaction with the public on planning is a huge source of complaint to my constituency office.  I have been told that telephone calls are not returned, correspondence is not acknowledged on a fairly large scale and the level of one to one interaction over the years has become more withdrawn.  It is more difficult to get definitive decisions.  The service to the public, even at a time when there are far fewer planning applications, has regressed.  The issue that has arisen in Waterford is a perfect example of that.  The councillor in question was told last July that all site visits were being curtailed.  The reasons given since then have been extremely unsatisfactory and unconvincing.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">There are many Deputies in this legislative body who have had experience as councillors and would agree that the most efficient and satisfactory way of dealing with planning is to get on site and stand in the field or street, as the case may be, with the planner and the applicant to sort out the application right there and then.  In the long run, it usually ends up saving the applicant money.  Initial clear direction cuts down on unnecessary administration later — that is my experience and that of many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">This is where the contradiction begins as far as Waterford County Council is concerned.  I have a document which the council produced without debate for the last council meeting.  Page 1 of the document states that pre-planning site visits are very valuable for applicants and councillors to help people in need of housing to get planning permission and, in so doing, reduce the cost involved, which can be substantial.  That sounds good.  The document goes on to state that such site visits enhance the level of co-operation between officials and councillors in dealing with the public on the complexities of the planning system, thereby improving the service and enhancing the concept of local democracy.  Again, no one will disagree with that.  Page 2, however, states that there is no entitlement in the legislation nor in the guidelines for the public to visit sites at pre-planning stage, and that the practice is hugely wasteful of scarce staff resources.  The idea here is that the council would set up a three-tier administrative appeals process before a site visit would ever be contemplated.  Waterford is not the only county inundated by planning applications.  The percentage decrease in Waterford has been as bad as anywhere else.  In other words, the council is saying it believes site visits are the way forward but it does not want to do them any longer, which is very strange.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I decided to inquire from other Deputies what the practice is throughout the country in their local authority areas and counties.  By and large, it amounts to what could be described as a fairly loose but practical arrangement throughout the country, structured on the basis of what suits and what is more efficient for the public, not the officials.  Interestingly, I got the strong impression from many Deputies that many local authorities conduct more site visits due to the smaller number of planning applications and the realisation that dealing with applications at source — in other words, on site — is the optimal approach.  The attitude of management in Waterford is that the public are not entitled to site visits because these are not specified in the planning Acts and are a waste of their valuable time.  Any issue, decision or policy change that substantially affects the service provided to the public by a local authority is not solely a matter for management.  It is also clearly an integral matter for elected councillors, who represent people who have applied for planning permission.  If the Minister accepts that premise, individual councillors should have the right to raise those issues in public in the chamber of the local authority to which they were elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">It is appropriate that the Minister would consider outlining some pre-planning guidelines in the Bill.  Matters such as this are clearly the remit of officials and elected representatives and are a matter for both parties, and are clearly not solely the remit of the executive and not solely a reserve function of the county or city manager.  The Minister should address this with new guidelines in the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The management in question in Waterford needs to take a step back and ask itself what its function is.  Is it to create additional administration or to provide a better service for the public?  As to the reasons it gives for not allowing discussion and deliberation on this measure, its argument does not hold water.  I agree with some of the measures being discussed in this Bill but I request that it be made clear that councillors have a clear and definite role in shaping how a local authority interacts with the public, in this case through the planning process, and that councillors are not obliged to conform with measures that ultimately disadvantage a service being provided to the public by a county or city council.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill.  I am reminded by the tail end of Deputy Deasy's contribution that I spent happy days as a member of Dublin County Council and South Dublin County Council.  I hope the Acting Chairman enjoyed his time as a councillor also.  I was elected in 1991 for the then Tallaght-Rathcoole electoral area of the then full Dublin County Council, which was not broken up until three or four years later.  When I was first elected, we went straight into the eye of the storm with regard to the development plan.  There was much controversy and we are often reminded of those times.  At the same time, it was a very important learning experience for me.  I took every opportunity to consider these issues, and I am glad I did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The Acting Chairman will know I live and work in Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1006">I remind Deputy Upton that I am from Crumlin, although I am now a proud Tallaght man.  Following my re-election in 1999 and as a Dáil Deputy since 2002, I have continued to examine the whole issue of planning.  To tell the Acting Chairman one of my little secrets, I would not be a Deputy today if I had not moved to Tallaght with an employer 40 years ago.  When I moved there, and in the next years of its development following the implementation of the Myles Wright report, it was often said of Tallaght that it had the population of a city but still the status of a village.  Facilities were very slow in coming but, happily, following the opening of The Square in October 1990, many good things happened in Tallaght, as they should.  There should have been a parallel development of facilities but, other than churches and schools, it did not really happen for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">If one goes out to Tallaght today, however, it is really, to use a Superman phrase, a metropolis.  One can go there by Luas and there are great roads, the Tallaght hospital, the civic centre and many other facilities that one would expect in a major town.  I am particularly proud of the development of sports facilities, including the Tallaght stadium.  Tallaght has come on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">If one walks around my town today, people still have views and concerns, and there are still challenges in regard to planning, just as in many other places.  It is very relevant to this Bill that people ask why we need all these apartments.  If one goes around The Square in Tallaght, which many Members will know and, I hope, visit on a regular basis, either going to The Square, the hospital, the theatre or otherwise, one will see many unoccupied apartments.  I heard Deputy Cuffe making good points about villages today.  A village should be a place people are proud of.  I am proud of Tallaght village, which I am in every day because my full-time constituency office is based there.  However, there are too many unoccupied apartments in Tallaght village and there are still more planning applications, including a current one for a nine-storey building.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">What do we want all these apartments for?  It raises issues in regard to the operation of the planning laws and it certainly raises issues, as referred to in the Bill, about An Bord Pleanála and how long it takes to do its business.  I receive regular correspondence from a community leader in Tallaght who likes to keep a low profile.  I will name him as Aidan Thomas and he is a good community activist.  He has made many suggestions and I will relate one he mentioned to me recently.  I do not mean to pick on my county manager or any other manager but he wonders why, when county managers are being interviewed and appointed, there is no community involvement.  I am not sure how that would work out.  For example, in Dublin South-West and south County Dublin, one could have a community person on the interview board.  The person could be from Clondalkin so how would people react in Tallaght and so on?</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">I mention this because people talk about such planning issues.  People discuss having a voice and a view on where we live and work.  As with the Acting Chairman's area, Tallaght is somewhere that people have moved to.  I mentioned the connection with Deputy Upton's Crumlin, where I lived.  There are many people now living in Tallaght who were originally from Crumlin, Drimnagh and other suburbs.  They have a view on how people should work, rest and play.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Decisions are often taken on planning that people cannot see.  I am proud of Tallaght and want to stress that point.  Like many people in the community I have worries about the number of apartments there and that kind of development.  It is important in the context of this legislation that such a point is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">I have briefly mentioned An Bord Pleanála.  I am telling a few of my life secrets now.  In 1990 I was nominated by the youth service to be considered as a member of An Bord Pleanála.  I do not think I have ever said that to anybody, and I am unsure what my qualifications were.  As it happened, the Minister of the day did not appoint me so here I am.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">People have issues with An Bord Pleanála and wonder why it takes so long for decisions to be made.  I hope the passage of this legislation will give some impetus to the issue and I am glad to see the Minister making proposals in that regard.  I hope that will be followed through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I hope the Acting Chairman does not mind being reminded of our great days together on the council before he went to Fingal and I went to south Dublin.  In my constituency and certainly in Tallaght there has been much development, with some still evident in parts of Firhouse and Ballycullen.  People have said there is not much joined-up thinking in some of this planning and one wonders who will grasp the nettle and tackle transport and schooling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">I am glad the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has mentioned that Dublin South-West is among a group of constituencies where the need for more school building will be considered.  People in Ballycullen and Firhouse say that should have happened a long time ago.  I hope that with the debate on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, such issues will again be considered, and people will get the sense that somebody cares about where they go and live.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">We saw on the news what happened during the flooding, although my constituency was unaffected, like many other places.  There are issues concerning where we put houses and infrastructure.  There are difficulties in how such concerns are expressed.  I hope this legislation addresses some of the issues regarding the taking in charge of estates.  It is some 20-odd years after many estates in Tallaght were built — I represent Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills — and it has taken forever for taking-in-charge processes to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Only this week I made strong representations to South Dublin County Council in respect of concerns expressed to me in Citywest.  In that new area people want to know why green spaces are not being taken in charge.  We go backwards and forwards on such matters.  An estate on the Blessington road, Newhall Court, had its first houses built nearly 20 years ago and the estate has still not been taken in charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">There are issues and I am glad the Government has given some priority thinking to this planning and development Bill.  It has been a while in gestation, although it is important.  I have listened to many of the speeches and all of us share concern about the issue.  I hope the Minister will grasp this nettle and understand there is cross-party support on the matter.  I know people will fight about dotting the i's and so on but it is an important Bill that we should press on with.  I am happy to concede to my good friend from Tipperary.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_578">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1019">I am delighted to add a few thoughts this evening to a very important Bill.  The Bill makes a number of amendments to issues surrounding compliance with planning permission.  As Deputy O'Connor  indicated, many of us have been members of local councils and we understand issues surrounding planning, the granting process and the importance of adhering to conditions laid down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Section 20, for example, provides that a planning authority may refuse planning permission to an applicant who is substantially non-compliant with a previous planning permission.  This was a significant issue in the Celtic tiger years which are no longer with us.  Some developers got too big for their boots too quickly.  They went from town to town and village to village building schemes rather than one-off housing.  These are not the local builders we know and value and which are required in our communities.  Such builders have provided many fine structures in a practical and architectural sense.  They have always done good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">We have seen cases with large applications and as land was zoned, we must take responsibility as politicians for that.  In my village and other areas, too much land was zoned for building purposes.  A builder might have wanted to build 80 or 150 houses but may have had unfinished work in other parts of the county or in neighbouring counties.  The planners have always said they cannot consider previous history and every application has to be considered on its merit.  I understand the reasoning but I welcome that there will be a change, as a previous record of work completion and adherence to planning conditions is vital.  We are closing the stable door when the horse has bolted but I still welcome the provision in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">A case may go for final analysis with a senior planner; some counties have planning committees and they should be in all counties so that a case will not be determined by the views of one planner.  This is not to condemn such planners as they are qualified but a group should consider each final application and have a broader view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Social capital must be considered.  Where there are defaulting builders and developers who have not complied with planning conditions — there are a number in my constituency — the matters go before the courts.  That is an expensive business and a gravy train for barristers.  We have seen tribunals in other sectors.  It is a tough business and I know the law must be adhered to, which I accept totally.  Matters may not necessarily have to be brought to court to get an injunction or permission to demolish a building.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">There is a scheme of houses in a town in Tipperary where that position pertains at present.  The court will give its decision on these matters and we must respect it but there should be some kind of social capital involved.  Instead of demolishing fine buildings — although not built completely in adherence to planning conditions — they should be used.  I am a member of the national board of the Irish Council for Social Housing and believe they should be used as social housing.  Amendments could be made to the Bill to bring this about rather than force people to demolish such buildings, which would be a complete and utter waste.  If the issues are small and the buildings do not interfere with landscaping and are not prone to flooding, they could be used.  We must consider such social capital aspects.  The rogue developer would be punished but there would be a gain for the State and the taxpayer above all, including ordinary people who are looking for but cannot find houses.  The courts should examine that aspect and an alternative use should be possible for such a development other than a decision that this scheme of houses must be demolished by a certain date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">While An Bord Pleanála has a statutory role, long delays have been incurred in its decisions on projects, although the delays are not as long as the delays incurred of up to 12 months during the busy periods in the past.  I understand it has a big workload but there should be more transparency and accountability in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">While I welcome the input of groups such an An Taisce in certain areas, a member of An Taisce who lives 40 miles away from a proposed development could lodge an objection to it and bring it to An Bord Pleanála.  While people have a right to object to a proposed development and it is important that right is enshrined in law, the planning process for schools and community facilities should be fast-tracked.  I am not saying we should break or bend the law but we, as politicians, are all aware of the planning stages that have to be completed to secure funding for a school project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">It takes years to secure funding for a school project that is badly needed.  There may be overcrowding in a school or conditions may be such that from the point of view of health and safety or road safety the development may be required as a matter of urgency.  There is a backlog in completion of school projects even though the Minister for Education and Science has invested considerable funding and effort into fast-tracking their delivery.  Progress on these projects has been delayed on issues to be decided by an An Bord Pleanála.  Some other mechanism should be provided to ensure that such projects should not be referred to An Bord Pleanála where long delays are incurred in arriving at decisions.  The construction industry and our economy need such investment now.  The funding for such projects is taxpayers' money and such projects would provide valuable business to an area and valuable jobs for thousands of unemployed tradespeople.  Value for money in the completion of such projects can be secured now, unlike times when those who worked in the construction industry were busy.  Some fast-tracking mechanism for the delivery of such projects is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">In saying that, I am not undermining the work of An Bord Pleanála, but in many cases when an inspector's report is submitted to An Bord Pleanála recommending a decision, the board may make the opposite decision, and the reason for it doing so is hard to fathom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">An oral hearing on a proposed development in a town in my county was held some months ago and, thankfully, the decision reached was the one we wanted.  The proposed development was too big for the town and worse than that it was to be sited in the middle of a flood plain.  The incidence of flooding has been a major issue throughout the country and the proposed development was a massive one.  As the old saying goes "people would say they would put legs under hens".  The proposed development was to be built on stilts and the river was to flow under it.  That is codswallop.  I have never before heard of such a proposal.  I live in the vicinity of a flood plain and anyone who knows about flood plains understands concerns in this respect.  Architects can design any development one would want, but the planned siting for this development was wrong.  It was a divisive issue in the town.  The proposed development was granted planning permission and then the decision was referred to An Bord Pleanála.  Objections were lodged and I made a submission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I raised it with the previous Minister of State with responsibility for public works and with my colleague, the current Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I accept he cannot intervene in such a matter, but logic must prevail.  The answer I would get from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding this development is that he cannot micro-manage town councils.  I accept that, but there is no point having grandiose plans for regional developments and flood plain guidelines if they are not heeded.  Thankfully, following the oral hearing on this proposed development which was a major issue and on which many contributions were made, An Bord Pleanála made a decision, with which I was satisfied, that it was unsuitable because of its scale and its potential impact on the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Some €4 million was spent on building flood defences in that town some years ago and in the flooding that occurred there last February and recently, flood waters came within inches of breaching those defences.  Therefore, that development would have had an adverse impact and proposed developments in such areas must be seriously examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Planning for community facilities needs to be fast-tracked to kick-start work on them.  In doing that we should not break the law but get around it by ensuring an easier system is put in place and that there is a more transparent system in place in An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The development contribution scheme is another issue.  I supported and voted for that scheme when it was introduced at council level.  I have never apologised for doing that because it is a valuable scheme in terms of the community facilities provided under it for many areas.  Substantial moneys have been collected under it.  However, there are people who have been granted planning who cannot pay their development contributions because of the collapse of the building industry.  There must be flexibility in this respect.  If we want to get these people back in business, to have buildings completed and to collect the contributions, this matter will have to be worked through and perhaps a site will have to be taken for a playground, as was done in my village, instead of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">There is a myth that councils have a slush fund of such development contributions.  I raised this issue with my parliamentary party today.  Substantial moneys were collected during the Celtic tiger era.  If this is myth, it must be dispelled, or if local authorities have this money, it must be spent now on the roads, building flood defences and driving forward our economy.  There is no point in having it in the bank.  If they do not have such money, we need to be told that.  I thank the Chair for his patience and I look forward to having further input into this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The recent flooding and the consequences of the freezing temperatures have brought into sharp focus the need for appropriate planning regulations.  There has been something of a philosophy of "getting away with it" in regard to the need for meeting standards and observing the regulations in regard to planning and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Unfortunately reforming the Planning and Developments Acts now is akin to closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Housing estates throughout the country have been under feet of water.   Such flooding affected Sallins in Kildare, Ballinasloe, Cork and the area from Roscommon down through the country.  While climate change has a very significant role to play in this, bad planning has been clearly identified by many people who have spoken on this issue, it having caused huge damage to householders, farmers and other businesses.  The senseless rezoning of land on flood plains is an extreme example of bad planning and we live with the effects of bad planning whether in rural or urban areas.   In Terenure in my local area, a developer who illegally demolished a habitable dwelling was fined a paltry €1,000 on a site which was valued at the time in the order of €15 million, which is an issue to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Many apartment blocks in this city are built to poor standards, which developers recognise at this stage.  Now we have the eyesores of many of these appalling apartment blocks lying idle.  We also have the problem of planning permission having been granted for various sites where, clearly, no development will take place.  There are other sites where planning applications have been submitted.  I am concerned that we will have a host of derelict sites around the city.  We need to take action to ensure that these do not become a magnet for anti-social behaviour.  This is an important point in regard to failure of planning to a certain extent up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Developers have left estates and apartment developments unfinished.  We are well aware of numerous examples of that.  An unfinished development is often a euphemism for a wasteland with no pathways, no infrastructure or local school and unfortunate residents are left with no public transport in the area.  They might have to plough their way through potholes to get to the front door of their house.  We are very much aware of such developments.  Landscaping is simply a far off promised land with no hope of it being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Planning permission was granted willy nilly for almost any development in this city.  The refusal of an application for any substantial development by the local authority was more the exception than the rule.  We are now reaping the benefits of another example of light regulation in the building industry.  For example, one of the reasons put forward for burst pipes in relatively new developments was that the developer failed to place the pipes sufficiently deep in the ground to prevent freezing and subsequent cracking of the pipes, hence some of the flooding and the water shortages now being experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I have acknowledged that climate change has had an important impact but our changing climate has brought home to us the cost of poor planning standards, the absence of any adequate regulation and the failure to enforce minimum standards.  It is our job in this House to act as public legislators.  I have serious issues with the Bill, as it stands, but at least it is an attempt to move matters forward and I acknowledge and welcome that.  My experiences of the planning system in Dublin South-Central are, I am sure, similar to that in many other constituencies.  The role of the local authorities is paramount to ensuring good planning.  A significant portion of this Bill is dedicated to ensuring that local development plans are in keeping with national strategies, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">I refer specifically to a planning issue that was of recent concern to me.  A planning application was submitted by a developer for a private hospital on the grounds of St. James's Hospital.  While I disagree with the philosophy of building private hospitals on public grounds, that is a separate matter, and the developer was entirely within his rights to submit such an application.  Of much greater concern to me was the response of Dublin City Council to a request to place a chapel located on the grounds of the hospital on the list of protected structures, which it failed to do.  Coincidentally, as part of the development, there was an application by the developer to demolish the chapel.  Prior to the submission of the planning application, a request to put the chapel on the list of protected structures was made to the area committee, which recommended that it be placed on the list.  The normal procedure in such cases is that the proposal then goes before the next full meeting of the council.  In fact, this is a reserved function of the councillors.  The area committee agreed to this in May 2008.  Now, after 18 months, the proposal still has not gone before the full council.  Whether the chapel is ultimately placed on the list, it is a matter for the council to accept or not to accept the recommendation of the area committee.  In effect, the council officials are thumbing their noses at the elected councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">A planning decision is due shortly on the application for the private hospital, which includes an application for demolition of the chapel.  If planning permission is granted by the city council and it is permitted to demolish the chapel, this will raise serious questions about the transparency of the planning process and the meaning of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">Last year I introduced a Private Members' Bill in the House on the issue of prior breaches of planning legislation.  Section 20 of the current Bill is concerned with the sanctions placed on a developer if he or she is found guilty of breaching planning permission.  I welcome the fact that this is included in the Bill, but the proposed sanctions are paltry, and I will table amendments to this on Committee Stage.  The sanction, as the Bill stands, would only preclude the developer from seeking planning permission, which would have little or no effect as he or she will be able to appeal this decision.  In the Private Members' Bill I proposed much stronger sanctions.  The Bill stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1046">Where a person is convicted of an offence to which section 4 applies and the court is satisfied that the relevant provision of the Principal Act was contravened deliberately and with a view to increasing the value of the land concerned, then, during the period of five years from the date of conviction or such other period as the court, on the application of the prosecutor and having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may order—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1047">(<i>a</i>) a planning authority shall not grant the person permission in respect of any application for development that is made in the course of, or is connected with, the business of dealing in or developing land,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1048">(<i>b</i>) that person shall not be appointed or act as a director or other officer of, or be in any way, whether directly or indirectly, concerned or take part in the promotion, formation or management of, any company the business of which involves dealing in or developing land.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">This would, in effect, keep a developer out of the business for five years, which would be a significant sanction and more effective than anything proposed here.  I urge the Minister to take account of this.  I refer to the event in Terenure in which a convent was knocked down by a developer, who was given a paltry fine of €1,000 — a tiny amount compared to the vast value of the land at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The purpose of section 28 is to reduce the number required to achieve a quorum for a board decision of An Bord Pleanála from three to two.  This is a retrograde step.  Three has traditionally been the number for a quorum.  This will do little to improve planning law and I question the need for it in the current climate in which the number of applications to An Bord Pleanála has reduced substantially.  An Bord Pleanála has been effective and proactive in addressing problematic decisions made by local authorities and I welcome the fact that it has this role.  Thus, I question the necessity of reducing the number required for a quorum from three totwo.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">Section 29 seeks to increase the fines levied under the principal Act, mostly by a factor of three.  While this is welcome, the fine does not fit the crime.  We need to make the penalty such a disincentive as to prevent any breaches of planning law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">On the issue of information for local residents, any public representative who must deal with planning applications for substantial developments in his or her area will be aware of the impact they will have on local residents and the environment.  I propose that a developer be obliged to provide information to every household within a specific radius of the location of the proposed development.  As the law currently stands, developers must put up a site notice that may or may not be seen by local residents.  Where a substantial development is proposed — for example, more than 250 residential units, although that is open to discussion — the developer should be required to advertise and hold a public meeting to seek to address the concerns raised by the local community.  This would benefit the local community and the developer, because a consensus can be arrived at through discussion rather than confrontation later on.  If a consensus can be arrived at, this could prevent later planning objections and appeals to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Around the country there are numerous examples of poor developments, with large blocks of houses and few or no services.  I emphasise the need to ensure that the required infrastructure is there, particularly schools, as has been mentioned by several Deputies.  Such a recommendation is contained in the Bill, but there is no requirement that a school be provided as part of a development.  I ask the Minister to consider making this provision more substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">This Bill is necessary to amend the serious flaws in our local and national planning system.  There are several positive aspects to the Bill, but there are also a number of areas in which there is much room for improvement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1055">This Bill is timely, given the ongoing issues with property development and planning matters.  To that extent, it can be welcomed.  I support the positive proposals in the legislation which are designed to introduce improvements in the overall planning process.  However, while I will not vote against Second Stage, I will propose amendments on Committee Stage as there are improvements that could be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">The recent flooding in many parts of the country — leading, in some cases, to the virtual destruction of people's homes — has highlighted deficiencies in local planning and raised serious questions about the permitted location of housing developments and the procedures that resulted in permission being granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Several weeks ago I visited Carlow, Sallins, the Shannon basin and parts of west Cork.  In many areas it was evident to the naked eye that granting planning permission for developments was a recipe for disaster.  I raised this issue before Christmas, mentioning the building of homes in locations in which there were historical records of flooding.  There may not have been flooding in some of these locations for many years — perhaps even in living memory — but where housing developments were allowed to proceed in locations close to rivers or in water basins, that risk was always present.  Some of the newer developments where flooding did take place were in areas whose placenames actually referred to water, which might have provided a clue to those dealing with the planning applications.  Two years ago, not far from where I live, in Banna — part of which is under water for perhaps six weeks of the year — planning permission was granted for a mobile home park, although it was subsequently refused by An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The dangerous phenomenon of developers using elected representatives to put pressure on council employees, planners and so forth, to secure planning permission to satisfy their own greed, needs to be addressed.  Surely planners and developers ought to have paused and considered why nobody had built in locations such as I mentioned, even though they were close to existing settlements.  We now know the reasons, but unfortunately that knowledge comes too late for those whose homes have been destroyed.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_583">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1059">I welcome the opportunity provided to Members by the Labour Party to debate this issue.  The Government must realise that there is great political and public scepticism about its attitude to investigating the banking inquiry.  This is not a surprise because such scepticism has arisen from the Government's reaction whereby, from the very first day that such an investigation was mooted by the Governor of the Central Bank, the response was evasive.  It was to the effect that the Government was too busy with other matters to have an investigation or that, while an investigation should by all means be held, it should be in the long-distant future.  Members who were told it would be too costly or would be a political football now are expected to believe the Government is fully open about the investigation, which strains credibility.  People's scepticism is greatly enhanced by noting that the form of inquiry being proposed by the Government is so constrained in respect both of its terms of reference and of the period over which it is to investigate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">It betrays the fact that there still remains a culture within the Government that does not believe public officers, whether elected or non-elected, should be accountable.  Accountability is at the heart of this matter and a culture exists within the Government that simply does not accept that anyone is responsible or that anyone should take responsibility when things go wrong.  The reason the public wishes to see an inquiry in the public domain is that in part, contrary to what the Government would suggest, this is not simply about finding out the reasons and causes but is about the very notion that people are accountable.  Those who hold high offices in the country, whether it be a non-elected office such as the power to investigate and regulate the banking system and ensure that excesses do not occur or whether it be a political role, must be accountable in public for their stewardship.  This is at the heart of any proper system and is at the heart of any democratic parliament that is worth its salt.  Members should be capable of holding people to account and this simply has not been possible.  It has not been possible for many reasons, some of which were created by the courts' circumventing of the Dáil's ability to perform such work properly.  However, Members must return to a position whereby Parliament holds people to account.  This is a fundamental point in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I have heard the terms of reference which have been set by the Minister described as being focused.  The only thing on which I can discern them being focused is on ensuring that nothing involving political accountability will be properly investigated.  The sort of focus involved is to keep it away from the Government at all costs.  The Government has stated that an investigation of systemic failure in the banking sector is needed.  This is to suggest that the commission of inquiry should have a narrow focus and simply is about the banking sector.  The Minister of State is aware that in respect of what has gone wrong in Ireland, the banking crisis is a symptom of a much deeper systemic failure that has occurred.  I refer to a failure of our system of governance and regulation, as well as the willingness and ability to hold power in all its shapes to account.  That is what is at the heart of this matter.  There has been regulation in Ireland in which no probing scepticism was exercised by the regulators.  There have been unhealthy linkages between policymakers, regulators and those who stood to gain from their decisions.  Such unhealthy relationships have been developed by a political culture that has occurred during the past ten years in particular.  It has discerned no difference between personal and political donations, has appointed those who made donations to boards and has favoured some of those people in political decisions that were taken subsequently.  Members have the evidence of that trail and the moral, ethical and accountability boundaries that should have prevailed and kept those matters separate simply were allowed to erode.  This has formed part of Ireland's systemic failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Moreover, those who issued warnings about the impending banking crisis and the fragility of the economic model were treated with contempt by those at the head of the political system.  Such warnings not only went unheeded but were dismissed contemptuously.  The message was clear to those within the regulatory systems that the political system had a view as to whether the ongoing bank lending and property boom was sustainable.  Clearly, the political system was stating repeatedly that this was based on sound economic fundamentals and was the route to take when this manifestly was not the case.  There was no understanding and a political atmosphere was created in which regulation was encouraged to break down.  While I do not exonerate from responsibility those who were directly holding those offices, a political climate was created that stated the property boom was based on sound economic fundamentals and that these banking models, which Members now know were so holed below the waterline, were to be encouraged and supported.  This constituted a massive political failure that must be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">Instead however, I read closely the Minister for Finance's discussion of what will be involved and the only reference he made to the Government and its Departments was to consider the Departments' response.  Moreover, such consideration was mysteriously to end at September 2008.  As for the notion that the Government was only responsible for the response to the impending crisis, it was at the heart of its creation.  This must be acknowledged by anyone who is setting up the terms of reference for an inquiry.  It is wholly inappropriate to ask the new Governor of the Central Bank to decide on or to shape the terms of reference of an inquiry into himself and his agencies, albeit before his time.  This is inappropriate and trying to shape these terms of reference places the Governor in an invidious position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">There is a need to examine the manner in which the economy and the Government allowed policy development to occur that supported the banking sector.  The collapse of banking did not take place in a political and policy vacuum but took place within a policy arena that was created by the Government.  The shutting down of a veil of secrecy at September 2008 is completely unacceptable and inexplicable.  How can one pretend that a forensic examination of facts, the purpose of which is to shed light on the development of future policy, should suddenly end when the policy decisions start to occur?  Surely one should examine what sort of advice was being tendered by regulatory authorities and others and which shaped the public policy that has been adopted.  Surely one needs to know the reason regulators were stating in September 2008 that Irish banks were among the most sound and well-capitalised in the world.  Although this manifestly was not the case, it was being offered as an assurance and support to Government policy.  However, the investigation is to be shut down as though, while one must know what happened in the past, one does not need to apply it to what is being done at present or that one does not need to know whether the policy decisions that have been adopted are best designed to be least costly to the taxpayer and most effective in getting credit to flow.  The only reason such questions are not to be asked is that it is on the present Government's watch.  This is not because the power of a forensic inquiry might not be able to investigate such matters or shed light on how one should modify public policy from henceforth.  It is totally arbitrary and unacceptable that such a cut-off point has been proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The issue of whether the inquiry the Government proposes to set up should be held in public or private is important.  As I stated, I believe the conduct of public policy and the behaviour of those charged with its execution are properly matters for public accountability and the inquiry should be held in public.  I accept that when one is making decisions or findings that could affect the reputation of an individual who is not a statutory officeholder, elected or otherwise, different rules apply.  However, in shaping the terms of reference, one should make clear to the commission that the reason Members seek this investigation and a commission of inquiry is that certain matters must be held to public account.  Consequently, one should create an environment in which a commission of inquiry will use the maximum discretion available to it to hold hearings in public and will confine the private element only to instances in which the reputation of individuals may be affected.  If that were a term of reference, the Government would dramatically step forward, as Deputy Kenny said earlier, from the inquiry it proposes.  The Taoiseach said he would welcome such an approach but, within moments, he replied to the Labour Party leader that if an inquiry were held in public, everyone would have to have legal representation.  That is untrue.  Legal representation will be necessary even if the inquiry is held in private if it impinges on an individual's reputation.  However, there is no need for such representation if the inquiry investigates the conduct of public policy.  The Dáil needs to find role for politicians in the investigation of banking and to show that, once and for all, politics can hold public offices accountable for catastrophic failures that have brought the ordinary people of this country to their knees.</p>

          <p eId="para_1070">I am seeking that whatever can be established be agreed by all sides of the House, which is an effective and thorough inquiry into the reckless behaviour that left our banking system in such a sorry state.  The sooner we can have that inquiry the better.  The Green Party Leader, Deputy Gormley, was the first member of Cabinet to call for such an inquiry publicly in December.  We will have an inquiry that will ensure full public accountability for the actions that need to be taken and the findings that need to be arrived at, which we cannot predetermine.  It is important that we do not fall into the trap of rushing to predetermine the outcome as this would jeopardise the effectiveness of such an inquiry, although I agree with Deputy Noonan who stated last night that the public feels a need for a catharsis and that will not happen if an inquiry is held behind closed doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">It is important to read the terms of reference in full.  As my colleague, Deputy Mary White, said, the digging will be done behind closed doors in the same way one would conduct research or do homework but the grilling will be in public and the effectiveness of the grilling will determine whether we achieve the public accountability that will be the measure of this inquiry.  It is unfortunate that Members have described it as a "whitewash" before it even commences.  Such a prejudgment will play into the hands of the very people who do not want an inquiry or to be found out and who want to get away with the actions in which they mistakenly engaged.  I urge that we have faith in people such as Professor Honohan who is well recognised for his independence and rigour, not only in this role as Governor of the Central Bank but prior to that.  That is the reason faith is being put in somebody such as him when it comes to the commission of investigation's terms of reference.  It must be recognised, whether one is in Government or in Opposition, that, given the nature of politics, one is compromised from being quasi-judicial because for obvious reasons there is a political point to be made from either being in Government or in Opposition and it is important that there will not be the makings of a Star Chamber which would make for an interesting spectacle from a political and media point of view but it would not be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">This inquiry will adopt a similar approach to the Murphy commission regarding what must be done on the ground and that commission report resulted in resignations.  Nobody said it was a whitewash.  The proposed inquiry will be more public than the Murphy commission in that there will be accountability to the Oireachtas, an Oireachtas committee will be involved and questioning will be conducted in public.  I urge all Members to refrain from a prejudgment or political point scoring, as this will play into the hands of the very people who do not want this inquiry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">The banking system, however, is a much more important issue.  Let us have a banking inquiry as soon as possible.  That is what the Government has proposed.  The appointment of Professor Patrick Honohan, a recognised expert who has previously worked with a Fine Gael-led Government, was the best decision the Government ever made according to a number of Opposition Members.  Now that he has been put in charge of an inquiry in which his independence can be assured, doubts are being cast by the Opposition on his ability to do that because of his position in the Central Bank.  He is completely independent of the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party and he is the right man to undertake the aspect of the inquiry for which he is required.  An expert will be appointed to examine other issues and this will be followed by a commission of inquiry, which can hold its hearings in private or in public.  It was intended that the Iraq inquiry would be held in private but there was provision to allow the judge in charge to hold hearings in public, which is what he decided to do.  Perhaps that will happen with this inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">It is important that the public obtain answers.  Every Government Deputy wants to know what went wrong with the banking system.  The system went awry in other countries but we must primarily examine what went wrong with regulation and within the banks and what caused the problems we have.  The inquiry must get on with its business and answer these questions as soon as possible.  The entire focus of the Government must be to allow the banking system to continue its recovery, to allow the NAMA process to continue and to do whatever needs to be done in terms of recapitalisation to ensure our banking system remains safe.  This will be done in the face of opposition from the Opposition, but we must do this.  No matter what proposal is put before the House regarding banking, it will be opposed by the Opposition.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1088">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Everyone in the House shares a determination to understand the reasons behind the banking crisis, to get to the bottom of why it happened and to ensure to the greatest extent possible that lessons are learned so that such a crisis can never happen again.  A number of key questions need to be answered by the inquiry.  These include why Irish banks, which historically have been conservative, departed from the traditional model of banking where the level of deposits on hand determined the amount of money lent out.  Why did they become over-reliant on international lenders to fund their operations?  Why did they engage in a frenzy of reckless lending to a property and development sector, thereby jeopardising their entire business model?  Why did the financial regulator not shout stop?  Did the regulator not recognise the risks associated with what the banks were doing or did the regulator turn a blind eye?  Why did the Central Bank not ring the alarm bells much louder during these years?</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">Of course the role of Government policy during these years must be examined and this side of the House must be mature about that issue.  Was the legislation that established the financial regulator robust enough?  Why did the risk management functions in individual banks fail so miserably to identify the risks and address them in a comprehensive way?  What about the role of the external and internal auditors in these financial institutions?  Why did they not identify the risks and shout stop when it was clear for all to see that the risks associated with the banks' practices were very significant?  The bonus and reward system in place for bank executives clearly rewarded the level of lending that occurred and encouraged such risky practices to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">What is important for me, everyone in the House and the Irish people is to get to the truth.  We would all love nothing more than to bring in some of the leading lights in the banking world over recent years and subject them to a public grilling and put all of these questions and many more directly to them.  However, I would be gravely concerned that if we went down that road the outcome would be to prejudice the investigations under way to which we all want to see a successful and speedy conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The inquiry being established by the Government is not about the individuals.  The investigations under way will deal with those issues, it is hoped, in a comprehensive and quick manner and I will return to this point if I have time.  It is an independent statutory commission of inquiry preceded by two preliminary reports that will feed into the process.  Let us be honest: if we were to deal with the issue solely by way of a fully public Oireachtas inquiry, the temptation would be to bring partisan politics into it on every occasion.  Consider the debate we have had in the House since the banking crisis emerged in 2008.  It has been characterised by partisan politics from day one.  If we were to bring this into the environment of an Oireachtas committee, there would be division along party lines.  There should not be but it is inevitable that there would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">I am all for restoring the primacy of the role of Parliament and the elected Member but this is an issue on which a judgment has to be made on the role of Government.  It is better that judgment be made outside of the heated political environment which would inevitably dominate any public inquiry conducted in full by an Oireachtas committee.  Comments made in recent days about Professor Honohan have been somewhat unfair.  He is completely untainted by some of the practices that led to the banking crisis in Ireland.  He was among the first to suggest an inquiry a number of months ago.  He is a man of the highest integrity and he is well placed to review the role of the Central Bank during the period when the crisis took root.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The inquiry must work quickly, it must be efficient and it must be cost effective.  I am glad to see that deadlines will be placed on the completion of the inquiry.  This is particularly important.  The Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which I and Deputies Bruton and Burton are members, will have an important role to play at various stages of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">We need to see real progress in the investigations by the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement which are under way.  They have been going on for quite some time.  Yesterday, I saw news reports on the case involving DCC and Fyffes which went on for nine years and concerns a transaction from February 2000.  It was finally brought to a conclusion in January 2009.  I would be utterly depressed if that were to be repeated in the investigations into the practices at Anglo Irish Bank and other institutions.  They must be brought to a head very quickly so public confidence can be restored.  What certain individuals in some institutions did during those years was patently wrong and there can be no question about that.  The decisions they made had real consequences for individuals and families in this country, for pensioners holding shares, for people who bought property at the height of the boom and who are now suffering with negative equity, and for those who lost jobs because of the crisis of confidence and the recession which has taken root partly because of the banking crisis.  We need an urgent conclusion to those investigations and the people directly involved must be held to account and brought to justice.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_602">
          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1095">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the debate this evening.  It is important to state what is involved and what the Government is setting out as outlined in the amendment to the motion before the House because it has been lost in the flurry of activity in recent days and the wish to report not what is happening but one's individual bias.  I am sure it has been stated several times that we will have a report produced by the Governor of the Central Bank and an international expert or experts on the recent banking crisis and both will include in their terms of reference the national economic environment.  This will take into account the overall fiscal and policy positions of the Government and the overall national finances and the macroeconomic environment of the country.  This is specifically stated in the amendment tabled by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The Governor of the Central Bank and the international expert will receive a briefing from the Oireachtas on its priorities prior to commencing their investigations and they will then produce a short report.  I presume that briefing will come from the Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  When the short report has been completed and the key issues to be dealt with are known, the Government will bring forward terms of reference to establish a statutory commission of inquiry.  That will commence very promptly thereafter with a view to producing a very short report which will be returned to the Oireachtas for full debate and elaboration and enhancement through the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I do not know whether the work will be done by the joint or select committee.  I would prefer to see Senators included in the process.  I notice the motion tabled by Deputy Joan Burton proposed that the work be carried out by Members of Dáil Éireann.  She seems to be specifically excluding Senators from any role in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">When the commission of inquiry is established, which is a few months away, I suggest that the Government is very careful when choosing who to chair and lead it.  It will be an investigation and I would like it to be chaired by somebody with particular expertise in banking or economics, a forensic accountant or a retired Garda assistant commissioner with the appropriate legal support.  I would not like to see it being automatically headed by a barrister or a judge from the Four Courts.  The reason I state this is that many tribunals headed by members of the legal profession get more involved in the legal process of how they go about the work rather than the job at hand.  It would be far better if a different approach was taken to the appointment on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The process has been criticised because there will be an investigation prior to its return to an Oireachtas committee.  However, I remind Members of the House that this is precisely what happens week in week out at the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts carries out a detailed investigation every Thursday, cross-examines witnesses and re-examines them, all based on an initial report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In September 2010, the Comptroller and Auditor General will produce a report on the activities of all agencies and Departments under his remit in 2009.  Towards the end of 2010, when the report is fully assessed and laid before the House, the Committee of Public Accounts will carry out a detailed examination.  Nobody in their right mind would suggest that Members of the Oireachtas should carry out the audits of the Departments.  It is right that a report be produced by the experts, so that the Oireachtas can examine it in further detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Deputy Burton made a case personally by her own actions and by demonstrating her own bias.  She has drawn firm conclusions on what she would like to see as the outcome of this.  She had demonstrated that Members of the Oireachtas would not be free from bias, would not be neutral, and therefore would not be capable of carrying out such an inquiry.  It is important that Members from the Government side and from the Opposition do not carry out this kind of work on that particular occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">There has been a backhanded criticism of Professor Patrick Honohan suggesting that it is unfair to ask him to do this job.  If Deputies think that he does not have the gumption to examine the Financial Regulator's office and the Central Bank, then we are damning the man with faint praise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1113">Let nobody misunderstand what I am doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">There is no need to repeat what Deputy Fleming has said, but it is important to point out that people want us to talk about this.  I compliment the Labour Party and Deputy Burton on putting down the motion, because it gives us an opportunity to talk about something about which people want us to talk.  I accompanied a Tallaght businessman to a meeting with a banker in the city.  I jokingly said to the banker that he was in a profession that was less popular than my own.  That is the reality and people want it to be corrected.  I would have thought that bankers should understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">These issues have been raised in other places in this House.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs, under the chairmanship of Deputy Healy Rae, has held a number of hearings over the past few months on issues that fall within the remit of this debate.  The Opposition spokespersons, Deputy Enright and Deputy Shortall, have been involved in those discussions.  I am Vice Chairman of the committee, and in December we sent correspondence to the Minister and to the party spokespersons on finance.  It followed a presentation to the joint Oireachtas committee by officials from the EBS, when we were very anxious to get a hold of their proposals and their vision on mortgage arrears.  I hope they will get back to us and tell us precisely what they feel about those proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">We are all politicians and we all have our political perspectives.  There will always be differences and we will sometimes need to dot the i's and cross the t's, but I hope that we all have concerns about those families in our communities who suddenly find themselves in seriously challenging positions.  People who were quite comfortable until fairly recently, suddenly have challenging issues facing them.  They have to go to the local social welfare office and the CWO.  They have serious issues relating to their mortgages and other expenses.  The Government should be concerned about these things.  They are nearly as serious as security.  I hear everybody saying that the first priority of the Government must be the security of its people.  Security does not just mean keeping us safe from terrorism.  It also means keeping us safe from everything else that will affect families.  It is a fact that people are being affected by the current situation, particularly in respect of mortgages.  Families are often finding it quite a struggle to deal with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">I have been made redundant in my lifetime, and I am now dealing with constituents who have those same difficulties.  They want to know from politicians what is being done about it.  People are saying to us that there should be some process where the Government looks at the difficulties encountered by families.  Something should be done about assisting families.  We know that there is huge demand on local services in our communities.  MABS is doing a great job under a lot of pressure.  Workers from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in every community can tell us what they have had to do in recent times.  We all have tried to help.  I was involved in a number of initiatives with other colleagues over Christmas where the society had to respond in an even more difficult way than it ever did before.  People's homes and livelihoods are being threatened, and I think they will look at this debate and ask what will be done about the bankers.  There is much politics flying around in this debate and I suspect there will be more to come in the next 40 minutes, but people want to know what will be done to assist them.  Everybody is saying — even on the Opposition benches — that things will improve and the recession will be over, but in the meantime people are suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">A number of initiatives have been taken by the Government in recent times on general banking issues, including the introduction of a bank guarantee scheme in September 2008 that covered seven institutions, including branches overseas in certain subsidiaries.  Other colleagues have spoken about the recapitalisation of a number of banks, and it is fair enough to talk about that in this debate.  A new code of conduct on mortgage arrears took effect on 27 February 2009, and a new code of conduct on business lending took effect last March.  These things should be reviewed again, because we have found in the past year that things are changing more rapidly than ever.  People want to continue to review these matters and to develop good ideas across political parties.  I do not have a difficulty listening to good ideas proposed by colleagues from other parties.  I hope the Government will continue to adopt an open approach in these difficult times by considering these matters.  If the telephone ringing in the Chamber is for me, I will conclude.</p>

          <p eId="para_1123">Yesterday was a bad day for Parliament.  "It goes without saying that the worst financial crisis this country has ever experienced requires an inquiry."  That was the opening sentence of yesterday's speech by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  While I agree with the Minister, what he should have said was, "The worst financial crisis in this country's history requires a public inquiry."  The inquiry is not public, Parliament has been sidelined and the critical events of the months of September and October 2008 are excluded.  We have a private inquiry that is designed to shelter the key players in our economic downfall from public scrutiny.  With evangelical zeal the Green Party continues to see white blackbirds.  So much for its demand for "an open public inquiry with meaningful Oireachtas involvement."</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">If "the worst financial crisis" in our history is not the business of Parliament, what is Parliament's business?  The Irish people who are paying the piper want accountability.  They expect to see those responsible for the banking crash made amenable and want to judge for themselves why and how the crash happened.  The Government has relegated the process by having it behind closed doors.  When the report is finished — hopefully some time in 2011, although it may well be later — Dáil Éireann will be invited in a routine way to discuss its findings after the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">I am sorry Deputy Fleming has left the House.  I have some reservations about the wisdom of imposing on the new Governor of the Central Bank the obligation to investigate his staff, nor is it clear that Professor Honohan can discharge such a function without breaching section 33AK of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The Dáil is being diminished in relevance, while the executive and the judicial arms continue to develop.  The Labour Party is convinced that the parliamentary model of inquiry can be a focused, cost-effective, expeditious and fair means of dealing with issues of important public interest, legislative proposals, public accountability of the Executive and its agencies and value for money in respect of public moneys, whether voted by the Dáil or raised from other sources.  Our conclusion is that an effective parliamentary power of inquiry is essential to the relevance of parliament to public life in a modern day, representative democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The parliamentary inquiry, properly organised and conducted, is a natural extension of parliamentary oversight.  The Labour Party Bill would enable such an inquiry which, in turn, would have enhanced Parliament and satisfied the demands of most people who are being burdened with higher taxes and pay cuts to rescue the banks from their reckless behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Our main argument for strengthening the Dáil is that it enhances public accountability.  A vigorously active and independent parliament with the powers to investigate matters of serious public importance would ensure the systemic abuses and breakdown of good government highlighted by the DIRT inquiry, the various tribunals and other inquiries would be less likely to recur.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">This secret inquiry is an old style Fianna Fáil stroke.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party know well what they are doing.  Members of  the Green Party, on the other hand, are like those people who visited Knock and damaged their eyesight while staring into the sun.  Being in government has dazzled them so badly that they do not recognise that the only thing public about this inquiry is their humiliation by Fianna Fáil.  It is amusing to note from the contributions of Fianna Fáil Deputies that an outsider would be forgiven for believing that the motion was tabled by their party.  My friend and neighbour, Deputy O'Connor, like many of his colleagues, is upset about partisan politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_1132">Where else in the world would a government hide behind a Supreme Court judgment and use it as an excuse for not holding an open and informed inquiry?  In no other liberal democracy would a Minister for Finance stand before the legislature and, in addressing his justification for an inquiry behind closed doors, refer in one form or another and on no less than six occasions to the global international crisis, while omitting to refer to the political climate underpinning the anatomy of the crisis or the political decisions made that were inherent to its very character.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">It is extraordinary that the commission of investigation will not reach into the domestic political decisions which gave rise to the crisis.  That Ministers for Finance will not be subjected to examination or held accountable for their actions is ludicrous.  I am not sure if Deputies on the Government benches are aware of how ridiculous this sounds to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The Labour Party does not seek retribution, an issue alluded to by others, but it is entitled to seek to have answers provided in public to questions surrounding the role of the Financial Regulator.  Why was the regulator able to ride out of "Dodge City" with a €600,000 pay-out without being subjected to an analysis of his performance or at least some scrutiny of his decisions?  We also seek an answer in public to the question as to why Anglo Irish Bank continues to exist.  We want to know the reason analysts in the city of London were baying for a kill when a substantial shareholder in the bank could no longer cover his position.  How could one individual build up a stake of 28% in Anglo Irish Bank through numerous contracts for difference?  The hedge funds had a field day on that issue and no one in the Office of the Financial Regulator called time on the madness.  I am sure we will never know the reason because an open inquiry will not allow us to ask this very question.  Instead, we will have to continue to read the business pages of the broadsheet newspapers to glean the knowledge we so desperately need to make honest appraisals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">If there is a sound economic logic for the continuance of Anglo Irish Bank, let the case be made publicly in order that those who elect us can adjudicate for themselves.  As a society we need to learn valuable lessons from this period in our economic history.  We want Ministers for Finance to be subjected to rigorous questioning in the public interest.  The only way we can achieve this is through a transparent process that stands up to political scrutiny.  By not having this inquiry in public we add to the moral turpitude that has underpinned this society for too long.  We want the facts to fit the preconceptions.  As long as a veil of secrecy exists, we will not make the changes that are necessary to move on in a real sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_1136">While every area has suffered as a result of the weather conditions of recent weeks, I can speak only for the area I know best.  Before the President visits my area on Friday, the road to Donoughmore will have to be completely resurfaced and rebuilt.  It is the only road in the area which will resurfaced because the county council does not have sufficient funds to do what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">This story could be repeated all over the country, including Wexford, Dublin and Tallaght.  The unusual event that will occur on Friday is that the president will accept that all roads in County Cork are as perfect as the one she will drive on.  She will be like a queen, thinking there are new roads everywhere she goes.  The county council does not have enough money to redo the roads.  In Cork the water system is turned off at 9 p.m. every night because the water system cannot hold the pressure.  This is as a result of our economy going down the tubes.  We have a country in dire need of infrastructure such as schools, roads, water and all of the facilities a developed economy should have.  Instead we are bailing out the banks to such an extent that our economy will take years to recover.  The people expected to bail out the banks are those who sit here every day and serve this country, firemen and county council workers.  They are all taking a hit in order to bail out the banks.  The Government has decided that the inquiry into the failure of the banking system will be held in private.  The Government knows that if this was to be done in public, those who are angry at having their pay cut and not having decent roads to drive on would revolt when they see what really happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">I refer to the lack of regulation and the Minister who continually told us that regulation is a dead hand, that regulation should be lighter or that we should have none.  That is the scenario that brought us to where we are.  We have heard this scenario from Fianna Fáil backbenchers, telling us of the trouble their constituents are in with mortgages and telling us about companies going out of business because they cannot get cash flow from the banks.  We are not to know what happened and we will never know what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">This inquiry is designed to take Fianna Fáil past the next election.  A Fianna Fáil backbencher said today that the only focus is on Brian Cowen.  It is not.  We would like to know what Charlie McCreevy did during all of this and we would like to hear from Deputies Bertie Ahern and Mary Harney.  I will not mention the Green Party at this stage because its members do not appear to want to come to the House.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Environment, Deputy John Gormley, is like the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi of this Government.  He is on the television every time I look and on the radio every time I listen but he is never in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The economy is going down the tubes as a result of greed and lack of regulation.  We will not be able to see the very people charged with investigating what happened in this country, who they are questioning and what are the answers.  We will eventually get a report that will lead us to another report yet the ordinary person who works every day of the week will pay not just for the crisis but for the investigation this Government has decided we are not entitled to see.  It is a disgrace and I am more than surprised at certain members of the Government who are allowing this to happen.  I know that certain Members on the Government side are distinctly uncomfortable with what is happening.  It is about time their voices were heard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1141">The Government's decision not to hold a public inquiry into the banking crisis is nothing short of a disgrace.  It is an insult to our intelligence to pretend this is a public inquiry; it is anything but.  Anyone with an interest in politics and current affairs has read the many books dealing with how decisions were taken in smoky rooms, almost always by men who claim to know what was best for their country.  In politics, construction and banking, it appears a small coterie of people effectively decided the policy of the State and the impact this would have on citizens.  They behaved as if they had all the answers and were masters of the universe.  They were wrong then and Government is wrong now to hold what is in effect a private inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">It seems this Government is so desperate to protect itself and the bankers who ran rings round it for years that it has truly lost touch with the people of the country.  The citizens of Ireland realise that they and their children will pay for the mess the Irish economy is in for years to come.  They know the excessive mortgages, which hundreds of thousands of people are saddled with, are a direct result of the banking policy to triple bank credit relative to GNP in just 11 years.  They realise the banks will not lend enough money for years to come as they desperately seek to repair their balance sheets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The public wants openness, honesty and a real investigation into what went wrong in the Irish banking and financial sectors, why it went wrong and who is responsible.  This requires a public investigation, not a report conducted in private.  The only Oireachtas oversight proposed is that of the committee packed with and chaired by Fianna Fáil Members.  The Government is so petrified of having to take responsibility for its actions during the Celtic tiger that it is willing to sanction a whitewash.  If we are to learn the lessons from the collapse in Irish banking and to ensure this will never happen again, we must have a public inquiry that deals with every facet of the crisis in an open and transparent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">I listened to Deputy Mulcahy last night when he was asked about the timeframe of this inquiry and whether it would include September 2008.  He gave the usual evasive answer about his opinion.  We are not interested in opinions; we want facts.  From reading this, it appears to the rest of us that anything beyond September 2008 or from the beginning of September 2008 is outside the remit of this investigation.  So much happened beyond that date but we get opinions and no facts.  This means the banking guarantee is not within the remit of the investigation.  Is this because the Government does not want it to emerge how it was hoodwinked by the bankers into offering blanket support to the Irish banks?  Is it because the Government does not want the public to realise how much it knew about the perilous state of Anglo Irish Bank?  To limit the terms of the investigation to September 2008 is a whitewash.  Everything the Government has done with the banking system flows from the bank guarantee scheme hatched one night in Government Buildings.  The Labour Party voted against the bank guarantee, which was the right decision.  Bailing out banks to the tune of €11 billion, nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and establishing NAMA all became necessary because the Government had to take these actions once the guarantee was in place.  Otherwise, the guarantee would have been called upon, thus bankrupting the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">Another matter must be addressed by an inquiry and may not be addressed by the Government's private inquiry.  I refer to the complicity of the media in stoking the property bubble.  A few years ago, property was such a big earner for newspapers that the properties sections were often as large as the rest of the newspaper.  The media happily quoted the pet economists of the banks, who told us the property sector remained strong and the fundamentals were sound.  One could hardly open a newspaper without being told of the mythical property ladder.  Where is the property ladder now?  Is it stored away in someone's garage, has it been repossessed or is the property ladder to be purchased by NAMA, perhaps with a 30% discount meaning the loss of the few steps?  The role of the media and others with a financial interest in effectively scaring people into purchasing houses at grossly inflated prices, with the threat that they had to get on the ladder, needs to be investigated by a public inquiry.</p>

The amendment from the Government is designed to provide a convenient smokescreen that edits some of the most important timeframes within which the major decisions were taken.  We need an opportunity to see the uncut version of the film and read the unedited script.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_627">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1148">I thank my Labour Party colleagues and others who have spoken on this motion.  The most-read document in Ireland this month will not be a book on the bestseller list — it will be the individual payslips and social welfare receipts of thousands of people whose household incomes are dropping month by month.  The Government's proposals for bailing out the banks are linked to the decisions it announced in the recent budget.  As they look at the bottom right-hand corner of their payslips, people will ask why their simple expectations for themselves, their families and their children have vanished without a trace.  They do not understand why they are being told to take responsibility for picking up the pieces after the biggest economic crisis this country has ever faced.  Why are they being asked to take a share of the responsibility, having received none of the benefit?  To answer this question, we must understand that we face a political crisis as well as a financial one.  The crisis has been caused by Fianna Fáil's governance of the economy and the policy decisions it made over the past decade.  I refer to decisions on issues like property tax relief; soft touch regulation; the triangular relationship between the Fianna Fáil-led Government, developers and bankers; and the operation of our system of political funding.  Such decisions were not made in the boardrooms of AIB, Bank of Ireland or Anglo Irish Bank, or on a building site — they were made in this House.  Those who implemented such policies should be held accountable to this House through an inquiry conducted by their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">It might be difficult to state when exactly this financial and political crisis started, but we know for sure that it did not end in September 2008.  The proposal to undertake an inquiry that does not extend beyond that date is simply outrageous.  It is proposed to examine how the heat was applied, but not to question how the Government reacted on the night the pot boiled over.  At that time, the Minister for Finance said in this Chamber that the fundamentals were sound, that everything was in place, that there was nothing to be worried about and that the banks had the cash they needed to hand.  In October 2008, the Financial Regulator told us that the financial fundamentals were sound.  On the morning we were due to travel back to Dublin after the summer recess, Members of the Dáil woke up to hear that following major negotiations with the banks, legislation was to be introduced to guarantee bank deposits.  The Minister told us at that time that the system to be introduced would deal with the financial situation without costing the Exchequer a cent.  We have moved so far since then that matters of Exchequer accountability are now discussed in terms of billions and trillions of euro, with millions of euro being in the tuppenny ha'penny place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Rightly or wrongly, a significant percentage of the public believes there was collusion, if not a conspiracy, between Fianna Fáil, developers, builders and bankers and that this ultimately led to the crashing of the economy.  It is rightly regarded as suspicious that 40% of disclosed donations to Fianna Fáil between 1997 and 2007 came from the construction and development sector.  Does this explain why over 80,000 houses that were surplus to requirements were built at the height of the property bubble, when house price records continued to be set?  Does it explain why rules governing mortgage lending went out the window and repayment periods were extended from 20 years to 35 years and beyond?  Does it explain why trusted banking approaches, involving a duty of care to customers and strict income lending and property value ratios, no longer applied?  Does it explain why, according to this morning's newspapers, 300,000 homes are lying empty throughout the country at a time when 56,000 people are in need of housing?  Ultimately, does it explain why so many home owners are facing negative equity and living with the real fear of having their homes repossessed?  If, as Fianna Fáil frequently asserts, there is no conspiracy, it is in that party's interests to provide for a full public inquiry and thereby assert its good name.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">In his response this evening, I would like the Minister for Finance to state without any mental reservation that the system of inquiry he has proposed will suffice to examine thoroughly all the evidence and to allay public suspicion on this matter.  The Green Party have suggested that they will demand the assertion of certain principles during this investigation.  It seems to me that a quotation from Groucho Marx applies in this context: "those are my principles, and if you don't like them... well, I have others."  Obviously, that is what the Green Party has said to Fianna Fáil in recent days.  It was suggested last evening that the judgment in the case of Maguire <i>v</i>. Ardagh prevents future parliamentary inquiries from dealing with certain matters.  However, research conducted by me, and by the Oireachtas library and research service on my behalf, shows that the ruling does not in any measure prohibit or prevent the Oireachtas from inquiring into policy matters or into the activities of the holders of public office.  On that basis, those who hold or have held public office can be questioned in this House and in public view.  There is no impediment to such an inquiry, regardless of the fig leaf behind which Fianna Fáil or the Green Party might choose to hide.  There is a facility whereby former and past members of the Government can be questioned in public on their activities and roles over the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">Taken together, the collapse of our banking system, the failure to monitor the system and the manner in which lending, prudence and financial governance were allowed to get out of control represent one of the biggest scandals in the history of the State.  It is crucial to our country's future that a banking inquiry works and is seen to work.  Ultimately, such an inquiry should relate not only to the reputation and management of the banking sector, but also to the reputation of this House and the manner in which we conduct our business.</p>

          <p eId="para_1153">I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me.  I am glad to see the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the House.  I consider this to be the biggest crisis and scandal in the history of the State.  If we are to deal with something of that nature, it is extremely important that we do so in a proper fashion.  Our democratic proposal would include the Oireachtas in a public, rather than a secret, inquiry.  It is not good enough that the Government is proposing a convoluted hybrid tripartite inquiry, with no guarantee of any element of it being in public.  It is an insult to taxpayers, who are having to take up the burden of underwriting the €500 billion guarantee scheme and the €7 billion recapitalisation programme, as well as NAMA and the taking into public ownership of Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">Taxpayers are already paying through the nose as a result of the three most recent budgets, which hit them very hard.  It is likely that similar bills will come from the Government for four more years, in order to pay for what the bankers have done.  If we cannot respond by telling the taxpayer we will do a decent job of exposing those who bought us to this stage, what are we doing in this House?  As public representatives, we have been elected by the taxpayers to represent them.  The least we can do is provide a thorough, comprehensive and transparent inquiry for them.  If such an inquiry is to deliver the goods, it should reveal how it happened, why it happened and who is responsible for it.  It should make it possible for the relevant sanctions to be imposed on those people.  That is what we are doing here tonight.  The Minister is trying to turn down the covers. Keep it as tight as possible and do not allow questions on the €500 million guarantee or the decisions made by successive Ministers and taoisigh.  It will not be relevant unless we can get to the nub of the problem, namely, where and how decisions were made.  The public must be able to see that we are properly representing them in this House.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1155">I welcome that the House is in agreement on the need for a preliminary inquiry.  The reports of the two preliminary inquiries will shape the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry.  The Oireachtas will also be consulted on these terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">It has been suggested by the Labour Party that the legislation controlling the Central Bank may constrain the ability of its Governor to carry out the inquiry on the lines proposed by the Government.  The advice of the Attorney General is that such an exercise is within the scope of his functions.  Legal constraints certainly exist in regard to what the Central Bank or its officers may say in public about confidential data relating to financial institutions but the same applies to regulators throughout Europe and the rest of the world.  These constraints arise in part from EU law, which protects certain types of data collected by central banks and financial regulatory bodies, but that does not mean the Governor cannot undertake the preliminary inquiry requested of him by the Government.  Professor Honohan is in an especially good position to carry out this inquiry because he has full access to papers and information within the Central Bank and is therefore in a better position than an independent person.  Using this unique access, he will be in a position to report fully on the performance of the respective functions of the Central Bank and the regulator in the period since the establishment of the regulator, having regard to its statutory position.  There is no prohibition on the Governor giving his analysis of the performance of functions within the regulatory system or presenting in his preliminary report appropriate conclusions based on his study of the relevant documentation.  He is not barred from expressing in a report his opinion on these matters or on the financial system generally.  Most important, there is no prohibition on the Governor giving his guidance and advice on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of the commission of inquiry based on his research and access to data.  For these reasons, I believe the Governor is in an ideal position to carry out the task the Government has requested him to perform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Questions were raised by Deputies Burton, Kenny and Noonan in regard to the time limit of September 2008.  The Government has taken the view that the purpose of these inquiries should be to identify, examine and report on the causes of the systemic failures which have occurred in the banking system and which require the State to allocate significant amounts of scarce resources to financial institutions.  That is the matter for which the public wants answers.  If we do not understand how and why this crisis arose, we will not learn the lessons that will prevent it from ever happening again.</p>

Deputy Burton made the criticism that wrong practices which may have occurred in the banks or regulatory system since September 2008 will not be investigated.

          <p eId="para_1163">Deputy Noonan asked whether the inquiries will investigate the response of Departments and State agencies.  The Government's amendment to the motion clearly states that the preliminary reports should consider the international social and macro-economic environment which provides the context for the recent crisis in the banking sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1166">Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of why an inquiry cannot be held in public.  The Oireachtas will be involved in public and once disputed issues of fact are determined by the commission, the entire matter can proceed in public.</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">I recall when the corruption of the beef scandal, which was closely associated with Fianna Fáil activists and others, was uncovered by the media in 1989.  Demands for a tribunal of inquiry were vigorously resisted.  The then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Michael O'Kennedy, was on his feet where the Minister for Finance now sits to explain why an inquiry would not take place.  However, a very courageous minority leader in the coalition Government of the day, Mr. Des O'Malley, warned the then Taoiseach that he would leave Government if an inquiry did not take place.  Over the weekend, a would-be courageous leader of the Green Party who has exactly the same leverage called for an open inquiry which would be conducted by the Oireachtas and accountable to the citizens of this State, yet he does not have the courage to enter this Chamber.  The Green Party has rolled over on the matter.  What was promised by Senator Boyle through the media over the weekend and articulated with great passion and conviction by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has simply been swept aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">We all know that the glue which holds Fianna Fáil together is its everlasting desire for power.  The Taoiseach would no doubt have responded in exactly the same way as Deputy Bertie Ahern and Charlie Haughey.  If the Green Party really has the courage of its convictions, the Minister for Finance would be announcing the same U-turn as his predecessor, Mr. O'Kennedy, made in regard to the beef tribunal.  Sadly, we have the Minister, Deputy Gormley, rather than Mr. O'Malley.</p>

It will be no more than an inquiry in name.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Let us be clear about what the Labour Party is calling for.  We are proposing a public inquiry to be conducted by an Oireachtas committee, that is, a committee of the elected representatives of the people, whose hard-earned tax money is going to fund the banks and whose businesses, jobs and earnings are being sacrificed so that Irish banking can be subsidised by the State.  We propose that this Oireachtas committee should under legislation be given the power to appoint an investigator to carry out an investigation on a professional basis and to produce a book of evidence on which appropriate witnesses, including bankers, regulators, public officials and Ministers, will be questioned in public about what happened to the banking system and its consequences for the economy.  The Government has sought to represent this choice as one between what the Government is proposing in its amendment to the Labour Party motion and a tribunal of inquiry that will cost a lot of money and might last forever.  That is a false choice because nobody has suggested — certainly not the Labour Party — that there should be an inquiry of tribunal.  We have proposed that there should be an Oireachtas committee, similar to that which undertook the DIRT inquiry, and that such an inquiry be carried out expeditiously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Second, the Government line has been that one cannot have the type of inquiry that is proposed by the Labour Party because somehow it would be legally impeded from carrying out its work.  In defence of that position the Government cites the Abbeylara judgment.  We have addressed that difficulty by proposing a Bill which was prepared by Deputy Rabbitte and published last week which would give the Houses of the Oireachtas the power of inquiry available to every other Parliament I know of, would afford the committee the right to appoint an investigator and would delineate the difference between that type of public inquiry and the type of liability that would be imposed on people for criminal or civil purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The arguments being made by the Government in opposing the Labour Party motion are false.  The true Fianna Fáil position on this motion is that it does not want an inquiry into banking at all.  When we first raised this with the Taoiseach before Christmas, it was clear from his response to me that he and his party did not want an inquiry.  Instead they wanted this matter brushed under the carpet.  However, faced with the prospect of the Labour Party motion on this week's Order Paper the Government has cobbled together an amendment, a set of proposals it is calling an inquiry.  Fianna Fáil is spinning it to those gullible enough to believe that what it proposes would somehow be as effective as a public inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">It will not be effective for several reasons.  First, what Fianna Fáil is proposing would be unnecessarily lengthy, comprising three or four stages, including a report by the Governor of the Central Bank, a preliminary investigation to be conducted in private and a commission of inquiry which would conduct its business in private.  Only then would a report be presented to us.  Although dates are indicated by which various stages of this process should be completed, we all know that, as has happened in the case of every commission of inquiry that has been appointed to date, additional time will inevitably be sought if those dates are not met.  If a commission of investigation is established at the end of June, as proposed by the amendment, the summer will intervene and it will be autumn before it starts its business.  We can safely predict that by the end of 2010, the first report that will come from the commission of investigation will be one seeking additional time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">Second, the role being proposed for the Oireachtas is purely minimal and superficial.  The Oireachtas committee or Members of the Oireachtas will be briefed on what the private investigations and commissions are doing in the early stages but thereafter it is only at the end of the process that the report of the commission will be laid before the Oireachtas in the same way as the annual report of a State body, with no commitment that the Oireachtas can do anything about it and certainly no commitment that the Oireachtas can follow it up by examining those who are brought before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">Third, what is being proposed in this amendment is legally restricted.  I heard the Minister for Finance argue, as has been pointed out by the Labour Party, that there are certain restrictions on what the Governor of the Central Bank can do and say.  Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, clearly states that the Governor may not comment publicly on matters that are regarded as commercially sensitive involving the regulated institutions.  Of course the Minister is correct that the Governor is not prevented by that provision in the legislation from making a report, offering his opinion on the terms of reference of a commission of inquiry or any matter, or reaching general conclusions about what happened in the banking system.  He could probably do that now without any need for the provisions in the Government's proposal.  However, he cannot comment on the relationship between the Central Bank and the individual institutions, an issue that is central to the entire matter.  Without that relationship being examined, an inquiry would be quite weak and worthless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">Perhaps the most significant omission from the Government's proposal is the exclusion of its own role in the process.  The Minister has said that the purpose of the so-called inquiry now proposed by Fianna Fáil is to examine the causes of what happened in the banking system.  Deliberately excluded from the process is Fianna Fáil's own role in the handling of the banking crisis, including what happened in September 2008, namely, the series of meetings with representatives of banking institutions which led to the Government's decision to introduce a blanket guarantee that has ended up with the taxpayer having of necessity to take responsibility and carry the can for what happened in banking.  An issue deserving of particular consideration is the situation where Anglo Irish Bank was given a guarantee in circumstances where we now know it was a delinquent bank engaged in irresponsible lending and had to be nationalised within months of securing that guarantee.  All of this will be excluded from the terms of the inquiry.  I challenge the Minister for Finance to show how one can properly examine the causes of the banking crisis if one cannot examine the management of the crisis by the Government and make connections between that and the causes of the crisis, particularly in so far as those causes relate to failures of policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">I am not surprised Fianna Fáil has taken this position in regard to the Labour Party motion.  That party clearly does not want an inquiry that would at a minimum expose the policy failures of various Ministers for Finance, the present Taoiseach in particular, and the obligation that would be on them to account for their policy handling and management of banking during their terms of office.  That is the least worse scenario as far as Fianna Fáil is concerned.  At worst what might be exposed is the pivotal role of the party in the toxic triangle that brought about the banking crisis, the collapse in construction and the consequences for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">What I am surprised and disappointed at is the position of the Green Party.</p>

I call a vote to vote be taken by other than electronic means.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
            <p eId="para_1531">I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this most important of issues.  I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, for being here to deal with the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">A key factor is that the mid-west task force was established in February 2009 in the wake of the announcement by Dell that more than 2,000 people would lose their jobs as a result of the closing of its manufacturing facility in Limerick.  I very much welcome the fact that Dell continues to provide more than 1,000 high-end jobs in Limerick and we hope that number will increase.  This report emerged from the fact that a significant number of jobs were going to be lost in Limerick and the mid-west region.  This task force was established nearly 11 months ago.  Its report was completed and published within a short period by July 2009.  Yet we find some seven months later that little if any of its recommendations have been implemented.  That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">A person of the eminence of Denis Brosnan took on the job of chairing this task force.  It is extremely important that his recommendations and those of the other members of the task force are taken on board.  I note with regret that the IDA did not partake in the work of the task force.  The report's recommendations are varied and in its executive summary up to 20 issues are raised.  I wish to deal with a number of specific recommendations that should have been implemented with immediate effect.  The report states that Limerick and the mid-west region should be made a priority region for foreign direct investment. Yet we find that since the announcement by Dell, not a single IDA-backed job has been created in Limerick or in the neighbouring counties of Tipperary or Kerry.  A total of 134 jobs were created in County Clare last February, around the time the task force was established.  However, 2,500 new IDA-backed jobs went to Cork, Dublin, Kildare and Galway.  The majority of the mid-west region did not get one.</p>

            <p eId="para_1535">I am speaking for four minutes so I have another minute.  I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Another issue is that of promotion of the Limerick region.  Of the €53 million tourism and economic development plan, only €6 million has been dedicated to this, in the form of funding for the Limerick-Shannon gateway.  The report recommends that such funding should be provided and there should be a proper marketing strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">How will the European Globalisation Fund work in practice?  This is a fund of €23 million, consisting of €8 million of taxpayers' money from the Irish Government and €15 million from the EU.  When will it be fully up and running and how can it be accessed?  This is a key issue for people who want to become entrepreneurs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">I want to hear good news from the Minister.  What we want is action.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment says she will not resource the implementation of the report's recommendations.  That must change.  The mid-west has become the forgotten region; this must no longer be the case.  I want the Minister of State to tell the House that the recommendations of the report will be implemented, that Limerick and the mid-west will be the number one priority for foreign direct investment, that jobs will be created and that the globalisation fund will be accessible.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_683">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1539">I thank Deputy O'Donnell for sharing time with me.  The report of the mid-west task force has major implications not only for the immediate region, but also for north Kerry, which is quite close to Limerick city.  Indeed, we look more towards Limerick city than to Cork city.  It was unfortunate that the terms of reference of the report did not include north Kerry from Tralee northwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">When the task force was established by the Minister, she assembled a high-powered group which was the envy of those in many other areas.  Most of those people participated in the task force on the basis that action would be taken on their recommendations.  They are busy people who do not waste their time.  They received such a commitment at that time.  Now, they are disappointed and disillusioned.  Next Friday they will have a press conference for politicians.  I will not pre-empt what they will say, but I suspect they will be critical of the Government.  They put their time into producing this report and they now feel their time will have been wasted unless there is some effort to implement their recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">The task force report contained a good proposal for a large cargo facility at Shannon Airport.  My understanding is that the group approached the Government for support for this proposal, but to date it has received no response.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who is a pragmatist and in whom I have great confidence, will relay to the Minister how disillusioned these people are with the way in which she has responded to the recommendations of the task force despite her previous commitment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1542">I thank Deputies O'Donnell and Deenihan for raising this issue and acknowledge the regular contact we have received from Deputy O'Donnell on the issue of the globalisation fund over the past number of months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">As the House is aware, the mid-west task force completed an interim report which was presented to the Minister by the chairman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, last July.  A number of national and local issues were dealt with in the report.  All measures taken by the Government to address the downturn in the economy have benefited regions including the mid-west region.  The measures taken by the Government were outlined fully in an initial response by the Minister to the recommendations of the task force in late September of last year.  Given the wide range of recommendations in the report, the Minister also brought the report to the attention of the Cabinet, and it is currently being further considered in a number of Departments, as well as my own, following the recent budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">The Minister and I are very grateful for the work undertaken by Mr. Brosnan and the other members of the task force, and I will continue to keep the task force informed of the Government's work on matters covered in the interim recommendations.  The task force identified a number of issues for further study in its final report, which we look forward to receiving.  Over the coming weeks I intend to visit Limerick and I have no difficulty in meeting members of the task force to discuss their specific concerns about its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">As the Deputies will be aware, the European Globalisation Fund, EGF, was approved by EU budgetary authorities in late December 2009 and we anticipate the transfer of EU funds later this month.  Provision has also been made under my Department's Vote, as Deputy O'Donnell recognised, for the national financing element.  The timeframe permitted for eligible expenditure under the fund is September 2011.  We are continuing with the implementation of the suite of EGF-funded measures.  For example, FÁS has already provided guidance services and training courses to over 1,500 workers affected by the closure of the Dell plant in County Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">My Department will be the managing authority for EGF funding in the State, while the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will be designated intermediate bodies for funds transfer, reporting and monitoring purposes.  Approved funding will be made available to public beneficiaries delivering services on the ground to eligible redundant workers.  All intermediate bodies must certify expenditure in their areas of responsibility and report to my Department, and all expenditure must adhere to relevant EU and national accounting and auditing procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">It is imperative that the wide suite of EGF-assisted measures being provided to eligible redundant workers is co-ordinated in the most effective and efficient manner locally and regionally.  To that end, the Minister and I have charged FÁS with establishing a dedicated EGF co-ordination unit in Limerick to ensure that all relevant supports are co-ordinated on the ground in a timely, effective and efficient manner.  The unit will act as the primary co-ordination agency for the Department in the implementation of the EGF programme for Dell worker supports.  A manager of that unit will be appointed in the next week to act as a contact person for any queries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">This week, FÁS is contacting all relevant redundant workers to inform them of the supports being offered with EGF assistance in the areas of training, skills, entrepreneurial supports — which were mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell and which I agree should be a particular focus of the fund — and further and higher education.  It is also inviting workers to a two-day information fair in early February at which all service providers will be in attendance to detail their programmes and supports, to answer queries and to provide for course registrations.  A steering group will be established to include worker representative bodies in order to ensure that the views of the redundant workers and other key stakeholders are made known and fed into the implementation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">In the first week of February I will be going to Limerick to meet representatives of the redundant workers and hear their views at first hand.  I will also seek to meet the Oireachtas Members from the mid-west.  A review of the operation of the EGF will be undertaken by the Department in June of this year to ensure that all measures are being taken in a timely fashion and that all expenditure is reached within the designated period.</p>

          <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_685">
            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_1550">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue which is of particular concern.  I am alarmed at reports in the media in recent weeks about head shops, although such shops and the products they sell have existed for quite some time.  Throughout the country there has been an alarming increase in the number of outlets offering products which, while not illegal, are highly dangerous, according to certain reports, and should not be freely available without any form of control or regulation.  They have been described as "legal highs" and "party drugs".</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">I am particularly concerned about reports from health care workers in the past number of weeks, particularly media interviews with Dr. Chris Luke, a consultant in emergency medicine in Cork, who stated that in one weekend the accident and emergency department of Mercy University Hospital, Cork, had dealt with five cases associated with the use of such products.  Four of the patients had to be brought to the hospital by ambulance.  Dr. Luke described the reaction as being extraordinarily severe and a number of weeks ago, one girl took three days to stop tripping in the emergency department from the effects of such products.  The symptoms have been described as being the classic symptoms of those who use illegal drugs, with reports of psychotic episodes, disorientation and hallucinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">I visited a head shop today in Dublin and bought the product I have to hand.  It cost €30 for five capsules and on the front of the package is written "Blow, intense euphoria, 18 year olds plus".  I will leave it with the Minister of State who should pass it over to the relevant Minister.  On the back of the package, the product is described as a plant food that is not suitable for human consumption.  What kind of legal loophole or regulation is this packaging trying to get around?  On the one hand, it promises intense euphoria for 18 year olds only, but on the other, it claims to be only suitable for plants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1554">God help the poor plants as the ingredients are described as being ketones mix, herbal extracts and glucose.  This is alarming and is highly dangerous.  A selection of products was freely available in the shop without regulation.  Moreover, no one asked me what I intended to do with the pills or how I intended to take them.  There is a complete free-for-all in respect of the sale of such products in the shops.  Serious concern exists among parents, health professionals and young people.  The problem is that such products are not regulated and are legal.  They are being sold as legal highs and people are buying them who would not use illegal drugs at all but who find themselves in a sorry and sad state.  Someone will end up in a highly serious condition unless something is done to regulate such products and to ensure that their sale is controlled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The Minister of State should outline exactly what the Government proposes to do regarding this issue about which demonstrations are taking place.  There was a demonstration today about the situation in County Roscommon and public meetings are being held nationwide.  Parents want to see action in this regard as the present position is not good enough.  While the Minister of State probably thinks it is amusing that I was able to buy this product so freely, it is frightening to enter such an establishment and see the number of products that are for sale on an uncontrolled basis.  It is simply a case of handing over the €30 in cash.  This is a serious situation as 100 such shops exist nationally.  While there has been much media coverage on this issue, the most important consideration for me is the concern expressed by medical professionals about the complete lack of control over such products.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">Items for sale in the so-called head shops, such as those referred to by Deputy Clune, and which often are referred to as legal highs, are substances which are not controlled at present under the misuse of drugs legislation.  The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review and in particular any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health is reviewed.  For example, in 2006, psychotropic or magic mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale now is illegal.  On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">The Government has concerns about the growth in the number of head shops, their activities and the health risks associated with some of the products sold.  The issue of head shops also is of concern throughout the European Union and all member states are considering how to address the issue.  However, no EU member state has come up with a comprehensive response thus far.  Under the national drugs strategy, which was published by the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, on 10 September 2009, it is intended to monitor the activities of head shops and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken.  It also proposes that steps be taken to reform legislation in this respect where it is deemed to be appropriate.  To this end and under the aegis of the national advisory committee on drugs, a research advisory group has been established to identify possible options for the regulation of head shops.  The Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Revenue's Customs Service and other relevant statutory agencies are actively participating in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">Legislation was introduced in the United Kingdom immediately before Christmas to control a number of substances and groups of substances that have been on sale in head shops.  The Department of Health and Children, which has statutory responsibility for the drafting of misuse of drugs legislation, is currently reviewing that legislation to ascertain how similar controls could be introduced in Ireland.  I also will bring the Deputy's specific experience today to the attention of the relevant Minister.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_1561">I am glad to raise one of the real good news stories in respect of sport and economics to have taken place in the past 12 months and which I believe has not received sufficient recognition of its success.  Many people perceive sailing to be a minority sport that may be exclusive to those who are lucky enough to be able to afford to buy a boat.  The Volvo Ocean Race stopover or visit to Galway, which took place last summer over a two-week period from the end of May to the beginning of June, blew that entire concept out of the water.  There was a net benefit to the economy of Galway and the western region in general of just under €60 million over those two weeks.  A total of 600,000 visits were made to the race camp in Galway and to Salthill.  Almost 90,000 people came from outside Galway and from abroad to visit the city of Galway and Galway Bay as a venue for sailing and for recreation.  Moreover, we were blessed with fantastic weather at the time, as well as a large group of both volunteers and professionals, who made it all work well.  The experiences during those two weeks of everyone to whom I have spoken have been highly positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">We struck gold with the Galway stopover for the Volvo Ocean Race.  This race has cumulative television and radio audiences of 1.3 billion and approximately 235 million, respectively, and has been recognised by Bord Fáilte and other bodies as the biggest sporting tourism event since the Ryder Cup in 2006.  If one considers the recognition afforded to the success of the Ryder Cup in Ireland, one begins to realise the potential of such an event, which no one outside sporting or sailing circles had expected.  Although 90% of those who visited during this period knew nothing whatsoever about sailing, this constitutes a great example of how a relatively small Government sponsorship of €8 million could produce a return of approximately €60 million, as well as being a huge promotional event for Galway and the west of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The race starts again in 2011 and we must ensure that Galway as a destination again is factored into the organisers' thinking for the next race.  As the decision will be made by mid-March this year, the Government must campaign actively to ensure this happens because there is a lot of competition for Galway this time around.  However, Galway was recognised by the organisers as being the most successful stopover of the last race and we must ensure this happens again the next time around.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_690">
            <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
            <p eId="para_1564">I thank my colleague, Deputy Coveney, Fine Gael spokesperson on the marine, for his support for the Volvo Ocean Race stopover in Galway.  The Galway committee, headed by John Killeen, already has lodged its bid and its submissions to the Volvo Ocean Race organisers to have Galway selected as a stopover venue for the 2012 ocean race.  The committee has received notice that it has a deadline of 29 January to have in place a pledge from the Government to the effect that the necessary grant of approximately €6 million would be forthcoming for 2011 or 2012 and such a pledge is necessary to have the committee's bid even considered.  However, were such a pledge or letter of comfort to be supplied by the Minister, Galway, which is on a short list of three sites, would have a great chance of being selected as a stopover stage for the 2012 race.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">This pledge of financial support from the Government would be repaid to the Exchequer one hundred fold if Galway and Ireland again secured the stopover.  Nationally and internationally it is recognised that Galway was one of the outstanding stopovers and was a huge success last year both from the point of view of the Volvo Ocean Race and the benefit to Galway and surrounding areas, which is estimated to have generated up to 200,000 bed nights in May and June last year.  Fáilte Ireland is strongly supporting the Galway bid and an independent report by Ernst &amp; Young established that last year's event generated €60 million in expenditure by people outside a 40 km radius of Galway.  The investment, if forthcoming from the Government, would be a gilt edge investment.  Last year, the Galway committee headed by John Killeen, John Concannon, Fáilte Ireland and Enda O'Coineen had the vision, courage and tenacity to pursue this dream which culminated in the outstanding success of the Galway stopover and which surpassed the wildest dreams and expectations of everyone.  I acknowledge the support of the Galway Harbour Board, Galway City Council, Galway County Council and the hundreds of volunteers who worked on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">I appeal to the Minister and the Government for the necessary financial commitment which will enable Galway and Ireland to again secure a stopover for the race in 2012.  The benefits to Ireland of the international publicity that this would attract is immeasurable.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_691" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1567">I thank the Deputies for raising the issue.  As both of them stated, the matter of applying to the organisers of the Volvo Ocean Race to host a stopover of the event is primarily the responsibility of the host port, which is comparable, for example, to the manner in which a golf venue bids with the PGA European Tour to host the Irish Open.  The promoters who initiated the process that led to the Volvo Ocean Race stopover in Galway during 2009 are again seeking Government support to bring the race back to Galway in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The 2009 stopover was strongly supported by the Government, with funding being provided through the international sports tourism initiative operated by Fáilte Ireland.  A sum of €5 million was provided in 2008 and a further €3 million in 2009 as part of a special and dedicated Government funding commitment to secure the Irish stopover.  The total funding of €8 million provided by Ireland comprised a port rights fee of €5 million, seed funding to activate the Irish team and secure branding on the boat of €2 million and €1 million towards the building of a number of infrastructure items such as pontoons, which have remained in place as a legacy of the event.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">As both Deputies said, the 2009 stopover was generally considered to be a success.  An economic impact study of the race stopover in Galway, carried out by Deloitte, found significant favourable impact to the State and to the west, in particular.  The study found the overall impact of the race on Ireland was almost €56 million — almost double the expected impact.  The higher than forecasted economic impact was due mainly to a greater number of overseas visitors than was originally foreseen.  Within the overall expenditure, more than €24 million was earned in "invisible exports", that is, through spending by international visitors and participants.  More than 200,000 accommodation bed nights were associated with the event, which attracted 40,500 overseas visitors to Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">In late 2009, Let's Do It Global, the Irish corporate promoters of the event, approached the Government seeking financial support for a bid for Galway to host a stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race 2011-2012.  Since then the proposal has been considered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and representatives of other relevant Departments and State agencies.  Despite general support across Departments and agencies for the proposal, funding of the magnitude required from outside the existing budget lines is not available for the project in current financial circumstances.  Should specific funding become available, the Department and Fáilte Ireland have indicated that they are broadly sympathetic to Ireland hosting the event again and they acknowledge the possibility of again leveraging significant economic and promotional benefits across different sectors and interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_1573">The current overall Exchequer position is not favourable towards the provision of funding for such large-scale sports tourism events.  There are pressures on the tourism services budget of the Department and that position is unlikely to change in the next few years.  The current commercial funding environment is difficult and I fully understand why the Irish promoters wish to first secure a commitment to public funds to provide a more attractive and persuasive proposition to potential commercial sponsors.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_1577">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue of the school library service, SLS, which is available in every county.  There are structures in place to provide school books to every national school in a county on a rotating basis.  For example, the books purchased by the service in Galway are made available to all schools in the city and county.  Every school is visited twice a year.  They return books that have been read and they are provided with a new and different selection for the upcoming term.  A number of reading projects run by the SLS have been of great benefit to schools, including the class novel scheme under which any school that wishes to read a class novel during a term can borrow up to 15 copies.  The novels are written by well known authors and some are chosen to reflect aspects of the curriculum such as Irish history.  Other projects included the Interschool Book Club, which forges links between schools, the Big Books project for infants and parents and the Reading Tree project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">The SLS has been in place in County Galway for 40 years.  It has survived some lean and tough years and it would be a shame if all the hard work that was put into building up this service should be wasted if provision is not made in the Estimates.  The school book grant provided by the Department of Education and Science amounts to €2.1 million for the entire State.  It is a small sum in the context of the €8 billion budget of the Department.  This resulted in an allocation of €117,000 for County Galway or €4.50 per child in 2008, which is a small percentage of the Department's budget.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities more than match the grant of the Department of Education and Science, as they cover the salaries of professional librarians and the cost of library vans and book materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">The grant was not available in 2009 and I would like it to be reintroduced in 2010.  I hope the library service can be part of the smart school programme, under which €150 million will be provided for laptops and whiteboards.  The restoration of the book grant for the SLS requires only €2 million.  There is a danger with all the focus on the technology that we will forget about reading.  Reading should be encouraged from a young age and reading for pleasure should not become a thing of the past.  It is important that this facility be provided and, as a former teacher, it is important that we encourage both reading and writing.  I used to welcome the library van to the school in which I taught and I hope that service will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">I had the privilege of serving as a Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I had responsibility for libraries.  I pushed hard for library development and I would be disappointed if, while this Department was promoting library services, the Department of Education and Science did not restore the book grant.  I appeal to the Minister to restore the grant, to encourage both the reading of books from an early age and the rotation and exchange of books and to show that recreational reading is something we treasure in this country, particularly in our primary schools.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_699" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1581">I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this issue and I acknowledge the work he did as a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I will reply to him on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">The Deputy is aware that a number of difficult decisions have had to be taken with regard to the management of the public finances.  In this regard, education, while a priority for the Government, could not be completely spared.  These decisions included the decision to discontinue the funding the Department made available to local authorities to support school library services.  The priority of budgets since October 2008 has been to provide as much as possible of available resources directly to schools.  Unfortunately, it was not possible in this context to continue to provide funding, which in 2008 amounted to just over €2 million, to local authorities to support school library services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">The Minister strongly believes in the importance of encouraging reading.  Literacy is an essential life skill through which children access all areas of the curriculum.  Educational policy places a central emphasis on ensuring that the needs of children with literacy difficulties are identified and addressed early.  Standardised testing in English reading and mathematics has been introduced for all children at two stages of the primary cycle, and a range of intervention measures are provided in the form of professional development of teachers, provision of learning support, and additional supports for children with learning disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">Under the DEIS strategy additional teaching and non-pay funds are provided to schools designated as disadvantaged and there are three specific projects.  The reading recovery programme is a school-based early intervention programme designed to reduce literacy problems in schools.  It provides intensive individual help for children who have not responded to the standard instructional programme in reading and writing after one year in school.  A total of 228 DEIS schools are now included in the reading recovery programme, with 54 of these included in 2009-10 school year.  An additional 2,017 children are being taught throughout Ireland in 2009-10, bringing the total to 6,908 to date since the programme was introduced in 2001.  It is expected that 550 teachers in total will have been trained in this programme by June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">The first steps initiative is a research-based literacy resource including professional development courses and support materials for primary teachers.  The overarching aim of first steps is to support schools as they help all children make measurable and observable progress in language and literacy development.  Teacher-training in first steps will continue.  There are a number of strands to the first steps programme; the three being introduced to urban DEIS schools are first steps writing, first steps reading and first steps speaking and listening.  A total of 332 DEIS schools are now included in the first steps programme.  This roll-out will continue in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">The junior certificate school programme, JCSP, literacy strategy promotes a whole-school approach to literacy development at junior cycle.  The JCSP literacy strategy encourages schools to involve all subject teachers in adopting specific techniques in teaching the literacy demands of their subject areas.  A between the lines literacy handbook and training video were produced and distributed to schools in 2002 and they form the basis of the teacher training.  The JCSP demonstration library project began in 2001 and school libraries were established initially in ten schools.  The libraries are staffed by full-time qualified librarians.  A total of 25 DEIS schools are included in the demonstration library project.  I again thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1588">The Deputy seems to have tabled the latter part of this question on the basis of a mistaken assumption.  In fact, as part of the overall modernisation of Defence, the number of civil servants in my Department has reduced significantly and, overall, at a slightly faster rate than the reduction in military personnel.  The record in Defence is quite different to the trend elsewhere in the civil service.  Both the civil service and military elements of the Defence organisation have now achieved the strength levels recommended by the McCarthy report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">Overall, as I have said before, the modernisation of the Defence organisation is a public service success story.  The structure and organisation of my Department and of the Permanent Defence Force has delivered significant reform and productivity gains over time.  The civil servants of the Department of Defence continue to make a very significant contribution to this success story.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">In its report, the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, acknowledged the ongoing reform in the Defence Organisation. That report recommended a further reduction in numbers in both the number of civil servants and Defence Forces personnel over a period of two to three years. As I have already said, this reduction has in fact already been achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">In 1981 employment in Defence totalled 18,063 comprising 15,201 in the PDF, 2,163 civilians employed in barracks and 699 civil servants in the Department of Defence.  In 2009 employment reached 11,300 comprising 10,100 in the PDF, 820 civilians employed in barracks and 380 civil servants employed in the Department of Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">There are currently 344 civil servants in my Department and 270 military personnel in Defence Forces Headquarters.  The details are in a tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">The structures currently in place were the subject of extensive review and re-organisation both before and during the drafting of the White Paper.  Since then, the Defence Organisation has delivered successfully on a programme of public sector reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">The significant improvements over recent years have engendered a culture of continuous improvement within the Defence Organisation and I am confident that where change is required, it will be quickly identified and implemented.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that I remain committed to ensuring that the delivery of services by the Defence Organisation is as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">Because structures, roles, taskings and legal allocation of responsibilities vary so widely between countries, international comparisons are difficult and potentially misleading.  That said, to the extent that comparison can be made, it appears that the Irish Defence organisation employs considerably fewer civil servants than elsewhere.  However, this does not necessarily mean that our organisation is inappropriate to our circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1655">There is a long standing arrangement for the presence of a Military Police detachment at Leinster House and Government Buildings for security duties and fire patrols. A duty officer is on site on a twenty-four hour basis. These duties are performed in liaison with the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1657">The Military Police detachment is not tasked with riot control. The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with an Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required in a range of duties, which include the provision of troops for cash escorts, prison escorts and the provision of military guards at a number of vital installations.  As part of the Aid to the Civil Power role, the Defence Forces maintain an anti-riot capability in order to meet a contingent and operational capability at home and overseas respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">The Defence Forces Annual Training Plan provides for training in a broad spectrum of such Aid to the Civil Power related activities.

            <p eId="para_1660">Subhead D of the Defence Vote includes payments for Reserve Defence Force (RDF) training, gratuities, allowances and also includes grants paid into unit funds. The provisional expenditure figure for 2009 is €6,650,806 out of a provision of €8,900,000.  The budget for 2010 as set out in the Abridged Estimates Volume, is €4,900,000. It is anticipated that in the context of the finalisation of the Revised Estimates volume this amount will be adjusted to reflect the pay reductions announced in the Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">This reduced level of funding will be reflected in the number of days available for paid training for Reservists in the coming year.  Pending the finalisation of the Revised Estimates Volume, it is expected that the number of days available for 2010 will be approximately 50% of what was available for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">Training in the Reserve is comprised of both voluntary and paid training.  In light of the reduced paid training day provision, it is anticipated that there will be an increased emphasis on voluntary unpaid training.  The allocation of paid training to individual reservists will take account of voluntary unpaid training undertaken.  The aim is to ensure that all reservists who complete specified voluntary unpaid training will be afforded the opportunity to avail of a minimum of 7 days paid training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan has provided the framework for the development of the Reserve over recent years.  Revised organisation structures came into effect in October 2005 and the Reserve has been re-organised along similar lines to the PDF.  In line with the plan, new equipment, clothing and opportunities for improved training have been delivered.  As the Plan is reaching its conclusion, there is a requirement to critically examine the progress that has been made to date and to consider options for the future development of the Reserve.  This will be informed by the valuable lessons learned from the implementation process.  The RDF was selected for review as part of the 2009 — 2011 phase of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review initiative and this Review is scheduled to commence in the near future.  This review will assist in informing decisions regarding the future development of the Reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">The six Air Corps Alouette Helicopters, special tools and spare parts were sold in 2009 following an open tender competition to a French company, Mat Aviation, for €1.431 million.  The sale of the helicopters followed on from a tender competition which was advertised on the Department of Finance's e-tender website.  The tender documents were also available from the Department of Defence website and the details of the tender competition were also advertised in Flight International magazine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">The records show that over 60 sets of tender documents issued from the Department in connection with the competition and that a total of 12 tenders were received. The tender from MAT Aviation was accepted as it presented the best offer from the monetary perspective. The money received from MAT Aviation was received in the Department and lodged to the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Department's Vote.  I am satisfied that the tendering procedures used in the sale of the Alouette Helicopters were open and transparent and in line with best practice. The price received for the equipment was a fair price given the age and status of the helicopters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1670">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 105 and 255 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">In the context of the Government Decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2010, recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force has been suspended.  As I have already stated in the House I have made a submission to my colleague the Minister for Finance regarding the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force. My focus is on the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces.  The question of limited exceptions to the application of the measures arises in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">Within the available resources, I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which I have secured Government approval in the context of Budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  I am advised by the Military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 31 December, 2009 was, 9,933 comprising 8,095 Army, 801 Air Corps and 1,037 Naval Service.  As the numbers in the Permanent Defence Force have dropped below 10,000, recruitment will be carried out in 2010 in order to bring the numbers back to this level.  Details of the recruitment campaign for 2010 in relation to the numbers of general service recruits to be enlisted, whether there will be a cadet competition, and the commencement of any such recruitment campaigns are not yet available.  Planning for this process is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">The investment in improved equipment and training made over the past few years means that the Defence Forces are in a healthy state, both in terms of personnel and equipment, to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  They have improved in every respect since 2000 and comprehensive reform of structure and human resources has been achieved during the past ten years.  I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.  I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas.</p>

         if, in view of the stated fact in the defence services review that the medical corps is experiencing difficulties in meeting the health needs of the Defence Forces and the statement that medical corps personnel are increasingly stretched in service management and delivery, the ability of the Defence Forces to undertake missions at home and abroad has been compromised by the structures, staffing and functioning of the medical corps; the actions he will take to correct this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1675">Military medical services and facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities. The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.  As I have stated previously in the House the challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services has been ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces.  The PA Report reviewed the medical services required for the Defence Forces in light of their roles and operations, assessed the current arrangements for the provision of medical services and proposed a model for future delivery of medical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">In its assessment of current service delivery the report did find that the Medical Corps is experiencing difficulties in meeting the healthcare needs of the Defence Forces from within its own clinical resources and that Medical Corps personnel are increasingly stretched in service management and delivery.  However it found that factors other than clinical need, such as current processes and procedures, are driving high levels of demand for health care services.  To address this the Consultants have recommended a programme of major change.  The intention is that the difficulties within the Medical Corps will be addressed through the implementation of this programme of changes.  The high level recommendations include: a Centralised Command Structure for the Medical Corps and the creation of a Medical Services Management and Administrative Function.  This structure will provide strategic planning, resource allocation and overall responsibility for the management and delivery of the medical service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">The development of Medical Officer Lead Care Teams together with a re-focussing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks.  The report also recommends steps leading to a reduction in the number of doctor interventions, medical assessments and better management of health services outsourcing.  The Report reaffirms the need for a dedicated Medical Corps and addresses the challenges facing the Defence Forces in recruitment and retention of Medical Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">In relation to the actions necessary to implement the report I am pleased to inform the House that the governance structure proposed in the report for the delivery of change in this area has been put in place. It consists of a high level steering group composed of senior military and civilian personnel.  The role of the Steering Group is to provide planning guidance, clarify the approach to recommendations where required and ensure that the project is implemented effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">A dedicated Programme Group with civilian and military representatives is now co-ordinating a range of projects. It is progressing a number of the PA recommendations including the structure of the Medical Corps, the alignment of Defence Forces and Medical Corps strategies and the development of medical information systems. Work is also progressing on the recommendations on training and education, clinical issues and the centralised command structure, along with financial arrangements and outsourcing.  A number of the working groups that are in place dealing with these issues have already made recommendations which are being considered by the Steering Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The development of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government. This includes the expansion of the capacity of the Medical Corps to deliver a range of medical facilities on UN mandated missions.  I would expect substantial progress over the coming twelve months in implementing the PA recommendations.  I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad. Notwithstanding the current situation I can assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1686">Twenty self-contained en-suite sleeping units were purchased in December 2007 to provide accommodation for military officers in Cathal Brugha Barracks during term time when they were attending third level education courses.  While these units are repeatedly referred to as "containers" — they are in fact purpose built living quarters which, for the purposes of military standardisation and transportation, are designed around the size of a standard International Standards Organisation (ISO) container (commonly called a 20' container).</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">The units are built to meet required standards in terms of insulation and fire resistance meeting all relevant regulations and all are provided with heat, electricity and hot water.  They are designed for single occupation only and are allocated on that basis alone.  The military authorities have advised me that no reports were received formally by the Barracks Logistics Officer or the Area Engineer Officer in Cathal Brugha Barracks in relation to the lack of electricity, heating or hot water prior to the exceptionally cold spell of weather experienced recently.  During the thaw after the recent cold spell, there were some reports of burst pipes in the heating system which have been attended to. Such incidents are not confined to these units and have occurred in locations throughout the Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_1689">I am advised that, due to maintenance and certification issues, the Beechcraft Super King Air 200 aircraft is permanently grounded.  The question of funding a replacement aircraft has to be considered in tandem with the equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the overall funding available. In the current economic environment and given the pressures on the Defence Budget, a replacement aircraft for the Beechcraft is not regarded as a priority and, as such, there is no provision in this year's Defence Estimate to cover a replacement aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">As the Deputy may be aware, a very significant level of investment in new equipment for the Air Corps has taken place in recent years. The comprehensive investment programme included the delivery of Pilatus training aircraft at a total cost of €60m, the acquisition of two light utility EC 135 helicopters at a cost of €12.8 m, the acquisition of six utility AW 139 helicopters at a cost of €75 m and a major mid life upgrade on the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft at a cost of €16.5 m.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1698">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 92, 97, 102, 112, 118 and 259 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">A total of 419 Defence Forces personnel is currently deployed to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT), the mandate of which expires on 14 March 2010.  As outlined in the budget in December 2009, it has been decided that the Defence Forces commitments to overseas peace support operations will be scaled back in 2010 as one of the budgetary expenditure reductions. The operations where Ireland will be reducing its commitments will be KFOR in Kosovo and Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">However, in relation to MINURCAT, the Government is committed to retaining the Defence Forces presence in Chad, at its present level, beyond 14 March 2010, subject to renewal by the UN Security Council of MINURCAT's mandate beyond that date. I will bring proposals to the Government in due course seeking formal approval for the Defence Forces continued participation in this mission beyond 14 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Had the Government decided to withdraw from MINURCAT, the costs of repatriation of troops and personnel from the UN led mission would have been met by the UN.  Certain additional costs arise to the Defence Vote on an annual basis from participation in overseas missions.  The additional annual costs for participation in MINURCAT, net of UN reimbursements, is approximately €8.0m per annum.  As such, withdrawal from MINURCAT would have resulted in a net saving to the Defence Vote of a similar amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The task of force generation and filling the establishment of the MINURCAT force is the responsibility of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations. The authorised military strength of MINURCAT is 5,200 personnel. As of 30 November  2009, the military strength of MINURCAT is 2,766 personnel.  I understand that the military strength of MINURCAT is likely to further increase over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">I am satisfied that the required logistical support of Irish troops currently deployed with MINURCAT is being delivered in accordance with national standards. There are no concerns in relation to Real Life Support for Irish troops at this time.  Since the Irish contingent was first deployed to Chad in 2008, two members of the Permanent Defence Force have been repatriated as a result of sustaining sports injuries.  During the EUFOR Tchad/RCA operation, a dedicated MEDEVAC helicopter and Aero Medical Evacuation Team (AMET) were stationed in Goz Beida. This helicopter was specially fitted, adapted and certified for the transportation of casualties.  Currently in MINURCAT, a dedicated Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) helicopter is located on a 24/7 basis in the MINURCAT Force Headquarters (FHQ) in Abéché, which is approx 200km (70mins flying time) from the Irish Camp in Goz Beida. There are also two United Nations helicopters based in Goz Beida alongside the Irish Camp, which when authorised by FHQ, can be used for CASEVAC purposes which reduces the airlift response times. All helicopter borne CASEVACs have to be authorised by FHQ.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">As is the case in all UN-led missions such as MINURCAT, medical treatment is provided for in accordance with UN medical guidelines. These guidelines indicate that a casualty should be seen by a doctor within one hour of sustaining an injury/illness and transferred to a Level 2 Medical facility, similar to that located in Abéché, within four hours of sustaining the injury/illness.  All long range patrols conducted by Defence Forces personnel are planned in accordance with this guideline. Standard procedure for Irish troops operating with MINURCAT is that a doctor and medical orderly, complete with armoured ambulance, will accompany all long range patrols. This ensures that a soldier injured or wounded on a long range patrol would receive immediate medical (Level 1) attention.</p>

This structure will provide strategic planning, resource allocation and overall responsibility for the management and delivery of the medical service; The development of medical officer led care teams together with a re-focusing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks; Numerous recommendations leading to a reduction in the number of doctor interventions, medical assessments and better management of health services outsourcing.  The report reaffirms the need for a dedicated Medical Corps and addresses the challenges facing the Defence Forces in recruitment and retention of Medical Officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The structure and systems recommended in the PA Report have been designed to meet the demands and needs of the modern Defence Forces at home and overseas and to provide Medical Officers with a fulfilling and rewarding career.  To this end a governance structure for the delivery of change in this area has now been put in place.  It consists of a high level Steering Group composed of senior military and civilian personnel.  The role of the Steering Group is to provide planning guidance, clarify the approach to recommendations where required and ensure that the project is implemented effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">A dedicated Programme Group with civilian and military representatives has also been established and is now co-ordinating a range of projects.  It is progressing a number of the PA recommendations including the structure of the Medical Corps, the alignment of Defence Forces and Medical Corps strategies and the development of medical information systems.  Work has also commenced on the recommendations on training and education, clinical issues and the centralised command structure, with a number of Working Groups now established to progress these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1727">A vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service is currently in progress and a tender competition for a ship replacement programme commenced in 2007.  The competition sought tenders for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) and one Extended Patrol Vessel (EPV), with an option for up to two additional vessels.  The process comprised two stages — Stage 1, a Request for Proposals and Stage 2, an Invitation to Tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">During 2008, Stage 1 of the tender process was completed and, insofar as the OPVs are concerned, tenders were received in response to Stage 2.  Following tender evaluation, a preferred bidder was selected last year and detailed and extensive contract negotiations are now close to conclusion.  The decision to proceed with the final award of contract to purchase the OPVs will be subject to Government approval and agreement on funding. Subject to such approval, it is expected that the new vessels will be delivered for acceptance by the Naval Service on a phased basis from 2012.  In relation to the larger EPV, Stage 1 of the competition has been completed. Stage 2 will not be initiated until the contract for the OPVs has been concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">This strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.  The acquisition of modern new vessels will ensure that the Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State's sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland's obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1756">As the Deputy will be aware, emergency planning in this country is based on the ‘lead department' principle. This means that each department is responsible for assessing the risks, making appropriate plans and leading the response to those emergencies that impact on its areas of responsibility. In December 2008, in my capacity of Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I brought a document to Government entitled ‘Roles and Responsibilities in Emergency Planning'. This document, for the first time, identified the lead department and the supporting departments and agencies in over 40 emergency scenarios. It was prepared by the Office of Emergency Planning and was agreed by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is designated as the lead department in coordinating the national level response to severe weather emergencies. During the recent severe weather events, that Department chaired meetings of the National Emergency Response Committee, which included senior representatives from Government Departments, the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána, Met Éireann, the National Roads Authority and other State Agencies that supported the response. The Committee examined all of the issues arising from the severe weather. It provided a forum for sharing of information and helped to bring about a coordinated ‘whole of government' response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The National Emergency Coordination Centre was activated in support of the National Emergency Response Committee. Staff from the Office of Emergency Planning (civil and military) managed the Centre on an ongoing basis during the period of the emergency.  It should be stressed that the principal operational response to severe weather emergencies takes place at the local level and is coordinated by the local authorities in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Framework for Major Emergency Management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The Defence Forces, in their role as aid to the Civil Power (An Garda Síochána) and aid to the civil authority (i.e. local authorities, HSE, etc.) provided emergency assistance in an effort to alleviate the problems caused by the severe weather. All assets, resources and capabilities of the Defence Forces throughout the country were made available to provide this assistance, as required.  The support provided by the Defence Forces included gritting operations carried out on roads, transportation of health care workers and patients, distribution of meals, delivery of water supplies, air ambulance missions and support of flooding relief work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">Civil Defence Units provided assistance to the Principal Response Agencies in the worst affected areas and its support included the transportation of medical personnel to those who were ill and transferring patients to hospitals, as well as the delivery of fuel, food and water to isolated areas.  I wish to acknowledge the contribution of all those who worked tirelessly in extremely difficult conditions to help alleviate the suffering of those affected by the almost unprecedented severe weather that we have experienced over recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">As in all emergency responses, lessons can be learned and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government will undertake a review of the response to the widespread flooding that took place in November and the outcome of this review will be reported to the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning. I will also be seeking a report for the Task Force on the lessons learned from the recent severe weather response.</p>

            <p eId="para_1770">The Defence Organisation is widely recognised as a model of public sector reform. The report of the Special Group on Public Sector Numbers and Expenditure Programmes clearly highlights the fact that the Defence Organisation was unique in the public sector, having downsized over the period from 2001. The downsizing arising from the White Paper on Defence (2000) and previous modernisation initiatives has reduced numbers of civil servants, military personnel and civilian employees across the Defence Organisation. The focus has been on ensuring a fit for purpose Defence Organisation, which maximises value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">This modernisation agenda has engendered a culture of continuous improvement in the Defence Organisation.  Opportunities to reduce expenditure and enhance value for money are constantly sought. The procurement of goods and services is in line with best practice and where possible, opportunities to aggregate the procurement of goods or services with other Departments are actively pursued.  The property portfolio has undergone significant rationalisation over recent years and a value for money review of military training lands is ongoing and due to be completed shortly. A value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force is commencing and is scheduled for completion in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">There is ongoing critical analysis of business processes within my Department and the Defence Forces and I am confident that where a requirement for change is identified, it will be quickly implemented. Maximising value for money remains a key priority for my Department and the Defence Forces.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1777">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 117, 122 and 267 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The recent Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes recommended that the number of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force be reduced by 500 over a two to three year period as "operational requirements allow."  The reality is that based on current trends, numbers are already reducing within the Permanent Defence Force.  The Defence Forces, as do all military organisations, have an unusually high turnover of people on an ongoing basis in order to maintain the age and fitness profile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">I am advised by the Military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 31 December, 2009 was 9,933, comprising 8,095 Army, 801 Air Corps and 1,037 Naval Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas. Under the UNSAS commitment, we have provided for a total overseas deployment of up to 850 personnel at any one time. Our UNSAS commitment remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">I am acutely aware of the impact of the moratorium on the Defence Forces particularly in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organization. I am monitoring the impact on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the Chief of Staff and Department officials. As part of this process specific requirements have been identified and I am in ongoing contact with my colleague the Minister for Finance with regard to these exceptions to the moratorium which are targeted at maintaining the operational capability and command arrangements of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">To date I have obtained sanction to fill a number of key posts, including Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations), two Brigadier–General posts, and the Director of Military Prosecutions post. I have also received sanction for 100 acting up posts to service operational requirements both at home and overseas. In addition I secured approval for the recruitment of 42 cadets. Furthermore the promotion of 10 Non commissioned Officers whose promotions had been in progress prior to the Moratorium has now been finalized.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">In addition to the aforementioned an allocation of 50 promotions has been approved for the Permanent Defence Force by the Minister for Finance.  These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">These promotions therefore must be allocated in a manner that gives protection to the operational capacity of the Defence Forces.  The allocation must be balanced across both officer and enlisted ranks having regard to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  Military management has been reviewing existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole, so as to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">Following on from the Military review a number of priority posts have now been identified and I am pleased to confirm that 9 Officer promotions and 27 enlisted promotions have now been progressed. Some have been completed and the remainder will be completed in the coming days. A number of senior technical officer vacancies also have to be filled and competitions are being organized to fill these posts. The residual approved promotions will be used to fill priority posts arising in the next few months. In addition approximately 30 vacancies will be filled through acting up appointments in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">Within the available resources, I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which I have secured Government approval in the context of Budget 2010. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1788">My officials are continuing to engage with the Military Authorities in relation to the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Defence Forces in light of the Government decision to maintain a complement of 10,000 personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">The Defence Forces have improved in every respect since 2000 through the implementation of the White Paper. This represents a significant public success story. However the economic reality is such that the Defence Organisation must contribute to the correction of the public finances. I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.</p>

         the repair work recently carried out to the hulls of the <i>LE Emer</i> and the <i>LE Aoife</i>; the length of time that each vessel was out of commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [1993/10]

          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_726">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1791">The Naval Service flotilla comprises of eight vessels — the three oldest of which are the L.E. Emer (commissioned in 1978), the L.E. Aoife (commissioned in 1979) and the L.E. Aisling (commissioned in 1980).</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">There is a programme of continuous planned and preventative maintenance to ensure that all Naval Service vessels are kept in a seaworthy condition, and the Naval Service will only send ships to sea in a seaworthy condition. The three older ships are monitored through increased inspections and maintenance.  These inspections have recently resulted in extensive repairs being carried out to the L.E. Emer and the L.E. Aoife, with holes in the hull plating of both vessels being detected and repaired in the course of dry-docking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">When the L.E. Emer was routinely dry-docked in August 2009, a hole, 4 cm in diameter, was found in the ship's hull shell plating, starboard side.  As a result of this, an ultra sound survey of the hull was conducted and two further areas were identified that required repair.  As a consequence of these unplanned repairs, the programmed dry-dock period of three weeks had to be extended to six weeks at an estimated additional cost of c. €100,000.  The cause of the damage is likely to be salt water erosion and micro-biological contamination propagation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">As a result of the emergence of this problem on the L.E. Emer, it was decided to conduct inspections on board both L.E. Aoife and L.E. Aisling.  Problems were discovered with the L.E. Aoife, with extensive localised loss of hull plate detected.  As a result, an emergency dry-dock had to be carried out at a cost of c. €150,000, and the ship was out of service for a total of six weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">No such problems have been detected with L.E. Aisling, although further inspection and examination work is planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">A vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service is currently in progress and a tender competition for a ship replacement programme commenced in 2007.  Last year a preferred bidder was selected for the potential purchase of up to three Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) and detailed and extensive contract negotiations are now close to conclusion. The decision to proceed with an award of contract will be subject to Government approval and agreement on funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">As Minister for Defence, the health and safety of all Defence Forces personnel, and compliance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007, are of utmost importance to me.</p>

            <p eId="para_1802">Resulting from the Government Decision regarding the reduction of public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, recruitment, promotions and acting up appointments in the Permanent Defence Forces were suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">In June 2009, I made a submission to my colleague the Minister for Finance regarding the implications of the measures for the Permanent Defence Force.

The numbers participating in the Integrated Reserve pilots were disappointing and the military authorities had suspended the integrated training programme for 2009.  Options for the further development of the Integrated Reserve will be considered in light of the lessons learned from the pilot programme.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_730">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1841">I am advised by the military authorities that a total of 804 personnel have left the Permanent Defence Force in the eighteen month period 1 July 2008 to 31 December 2009.  This figure is comprised of 99 Officers, 312 Non-Commissioned Officers and 393 Other Ranks personnel.  A breakdown according to rank and per month is provided in the tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">I am keenly aware of the impact that measures such as the moratorium on recruitment, promotion and acting appointments are having on the Permanent Defence Forces in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organization.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">The turnover rate has increased significantly in recent months.  I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31st December 2009, the last date for which figures are available, is 9,933 broken down as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Army 8,095</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">Navy 1,037</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">Air Corps 801</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">My focus is on retaining the capacity of the organization to operate effectively across all roles.  This will represent a significant challenge in the coming months.  I am in contact with my colleague the Minister for Finance with regard to targeted exemptions from the moratorium which are aimed at maintaining the operational capability and command arrangements of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">To date I have obtained sanction to fill a number of key posts, including Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations), two Brigadier-General posts, and the Director of Military Prosecutions post. I have also received sanction for 100 acting up posts to service operational requirements both at home and overseas. In addition I secured approval for the recruitment of 42 cadets. Furthermore the promotion of 10 Non-commissioned Officers whose promotions had been in progress prior to the Moratorium has now been finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">In addition to the aforementioned an allocation of 50 promotions has been approved for the Permanent Defence Force by the Minister for Finance.  These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">These promotions therefore must be allocated in a manner that gives protection to the operational capacity of the Defence Forces.  The allocation must be balanced across both officer and enlisted ranks having regard to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.  Military management has been reviewing existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole, so as to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">Following on from the Military review a number of priority posts have now been identified and I am pleased to confirm that 9 Officer promotions and 27 enlisted promotions have now been progressed. Some have been completed and the remainder will be completed in the coming days. A number of senior technical officer vacancies also have to be filled and competitions are being organised to fill these posts. The residual approved promotions will be used to fill priority posts arising in the next few months. In addition approximately 30 vacancies will be filled through acting up appointments in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Within the available resources, I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which I have secured Government approval in the context of Budget 2010. This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">My officials are continuing to engage with the Military Authorities in relation to the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Defence Forces in light of the Government decision to maintain a complement of 10,000 personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2155">The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provides for the reduction of public service salaries of up to €125,000 by:</p>

            <p eId="para_2159">In addition, the Act provides for a 5% reduction in fixed rate allowances payable to such public servants</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">While the REV (Revised Estimates Volume) details for the Defence Vote have not yet been finalised with the Department of Finance, it is estimated that gross savings in the order of €34m will accrue in 2010 arising from the reductions in remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">There are three broad categories of employees on my Department's payroll, and the payroll numbers affected in each category on 1 January 2010 were:</p>

            <p eId="para_2174">The All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on the Centenary of the Rising met in Leinster House on Wednesday, 2 December, 2009. The Group were informed of recent developments and events, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2175">(a) Commemorations at:</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_2176">a. the General Post Office, Dublin on Easter Sunday, 12 April, 2009</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2180">(c) The future location of the Abbey Theatre and possible redevelopment at the GPO with reference also to the protection of 16 Moore Street.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2181">(d) Recent acquisitions for the national collections of items of interest relating to the independence period, amongst which were the 964 items of the Stanley Collection at a cost of €3.5 million. Other items purchased/donated include a letter from P.H. Pearse to General Maxwell and General Maxwell's brief reply and a copy of the Proclamation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2182">(e) Assistance towards themed publications i.e. the Royal Irish Academy's recent publication on Seán Lemass, and the SIPTU sponsored publication on James Connolly.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2183">(f) The Military Archives Project envisages that files, being the service records of personnel involved in the struggle for independence, would be released into the public domain on a phased basis in the years leading to the Centenary of the Rising.  The Group were informed that an Advisory Board of historians had accepted invitations to assist with this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">Later that day, the group visited Glasnevin Cemetery and the National Museum of Ireland Collins Barracks to view projects relating to the 2016 commemoration of the 1916 Rising.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">At Glasnevin Cemetery, the Group inspected progress on the significant programme of ongoing restoration works underway for which €6.4m of NDP funding has been provided to date.  A new interpretative centre is scheduled to be opened in April, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">While at Glasnevin, the Group noted the four headstones recently erected by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on graves recording the British military service of the deceased.  It is envisaged that further such headstones will be erected over coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">Following a meeting with the Director of the National Museum of Ireland, the Group visited two exhibitions: <i>Soldiers and Chiefs — The Irish at War at Home and Abroad from 1550 </i>and <i>The Easter Rising: Understanding 1916</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">The Group also visited the ongoing restoration work being conducted on Erskine Childers' yacht <i>Asgard.  </i>This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">The future use of the GPO including the possible development of cultural and amenity projects is under consideration.  The suggested relocation to the GPO complex of the Abbey Theatre is currently being examined by the Office of Public Works. The decision on future use will have regard to all advice and suggestions received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">It was agreed that the Group would meet again early in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2192">As the Deputy is aware, there has been very significant investment in equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces over the past ten years. The acquisition of new and replacement equipment for the Defence Forces remains a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. It is, however, imperative that my Department and the Defence Forces look to whatever efficiencies we can make, taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for military equipment over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">Notwithstanding the current economic environment, several important equipment purchases will be advanced in the first six months of 2010 including the delivery of 17 Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles. A further 10 Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles will be delivered later this year. Other transport related acquisitions scheduled in the first half of 2010 include 22 Minibuses, 2 ambulances, 45 ¾ ton 4 x 4 patrol vehicles and 4 midi-coaches for troop transportation. In addition a contract was placed last year for the provision of 2 Heavy Recovery Vehicles for the Defence Forces, one for delivery in 2010 and the other in 2011.  A contract is currently being awarded for the provision of 50 Roll Over Protection Systems for troop carrying vehicles and these systems will be installed in the first six months of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">The extensive equipment investment programme implemented over the past 10 years has positioned the Defence Forces well to deal with the reductions which have had to be made in defence expenditure given the resources now available. Whilst no major equipment programmes have been cancelled altogether, careful planning and monitoring of all funding will continue to ensure that any possible impact on operations is mitigated and that the procurement of essential replacement equipment is prioritised.</p>

            <p eId="para_2196">My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has commenced the process of drafting a Defence (Amendment) Bill to amend the provisions of Part V of the Defence Act 1954, primarily relating to offences against military law and extended provisions for arrests and detention. The requirement for the amendment to the Act arises from the recommendations of a Military Law Review Board established to review the adequacy, effectiveness and fairness of the military justice system as laid down in Part V (Discipline) of the Defence Act 1954. I expect that the Bill will be published in the second half of 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2199">Like all areas of the public service, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will contribute towards resolving the current challenges facing the country.  The Defence Organisation will be required to operate on a reduced budget for 2010 as outlined in the Budget 2010 documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2200">I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 10,000 across all ranks. The Defence Forces will continue to operate across all of the roles assigned by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">The investment in improved equipment and training made over the past few years means that the Defence Forces are in a healthy state both in terms of personnel and equipment to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  They have improved in every respect since 2000 and comprehensive reform of structure and human resources, together with major investment in infrastructure and equipment, has been achieved during the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">There will be no new, cost-increasing expenditure measures introduced in 2010. The key current expenditure reductions in 2010 will be achieved as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Payroll savings of c. €14m will be achieved by a reduction in Permanent Defence Force personnel numbers, reduced civilian employee numbers and lower levels of paid training days for the Reserve Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">Reductions in the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel deployed overseas to Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will achieve savings of up to €7m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">Reduced Naval Service patrol days and the optimisation of Air Corps flying hours will deliver savings of €2.2m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">The Coiste an Asgard sail training scheme will be discontinued, resulting in a saving of €0.8m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">Additional Appropriations in Aid of up to €13m are anticipated, mainly in respect of UN receipts, property sales, cash escorts and military guards. The scheme of full recovery for security services will be extended to An Post, the Central Bank and other organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">The 2010 capital expenditure allocation of €16m will be focused on new building works to improve the accommodation and facilities of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">I am satisfied that priority programmes of investment in equipment and infrastructure will be maintained.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2311">I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 135, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">The number of apprentices within 6 to 12 months of completion of their apprenticeship without a job placement is currently 3,080. Of these, 495 are currently attending Phase 6 off-the-job training at an Institute of Technology.  A total of 5,338 apprenticeships have been notified to FÁS as being halted as a result of redundancy since July 2008. A total of 719 apprentices recorded as redundant in July 2008 remained redundant at January 2010.  The disaggregated data on a county-by-county and trade basis is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">The Teamwork Scheme was a full-time temporary employment programme for the under 25s which ran from the early 1980s until the mid-1990s. This Scheme ran alongside the Social Employment Scheme for the over 25s. Both schemes were then merged, with some changes, to form the Community Employment (CE) scheme in the mid-1990s. Training and education provided under measures other than the CE scheme are considered to be more appropriate to the needs of redundant or newly qualified apprentices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">FÁS has already put in place a number of measures to assist redundant apprentices. An outline of those measures is provided below for the Deputy's information. These measures will support around 4,000 redundant apprentices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">1. FÁS has put in place an interim measure whereby apprentices who are made redundant may progress to the next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, in line with current scheduling criteria.  In 2009, over 2,000 redundant apprentices were provided with off-the-job training and 1,041 redundant apprentices commenced off-the-job training in January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">2. In 2009, FÁS introduced a temporary Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme for apprentices made redundant in the Construction Industry.  Over 460 redundant apprentices completed Phase 3, 5 and 7 training and assessments with employers under this Scheme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">3. ESB Networks has agreed a programme with FÁS to provide on-the-job training with ESB Networks to eligible redundant apprentices at Phases 5 and 7 of their apprenticeship.  This programme will provide up to 400 places over a period of 18 months and is funded by ESB Networks. To date, 147 redundant apprentices have completed training, 92 are currently in training, and further placements will take place during 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">4. Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing trade-related specific skills training courses to enhance their employable skills.  They may also avail of the range of trade-related evening courses available in FÁS Training Centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">5. FÁS and the Institutes of Technology have agreed the PP5 programme for redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1-4 of their apprenticeship and where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not currently available.  The programme has both a Construction Stream and an Engineering Stream, with a number of core skills modules related to apprenticeship and a number of electives in specific skills.  The programme provides apprentices with a Level 5 FETAC award and allows for access and transfer of credits to other post-apprenticeship programmes.  The Institutes of Technology are currently issuing invitations to eligible redundant apprentices to participate in the programme commencing late January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">6. FÁS has also developed Phase 7-equivalent assessments for redundant apprentices at the final phase of their apprenticeship in the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Plastering.  Eligible redundant apprentices will be scheduled by FÁS to these assessment events which will commence in February 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">7. Redundant apprentices registered for 4 years who have successfully completed all Phases 1-7 of their apprenticeship, but have not yet completed the required 4 years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade, will be contacted by FÁS to submit a portfolio of evidence under Recognition of Prior Learning for consideration by the National Apprenticeship Advisory Sub-committee for the award of the Advanced Craft Certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">FÁS continues to closely monitor the situation in relation to redundant apprentices and newly qualified craftspersons.  Further proposals to assist redundant apprentices to complete the on-the-job training of their apprenticeship with a FÁS approved employer are under discussions currently between FÁS and my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2325">I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. The purpose of CE is to help unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.  Eligible persons under 55 years of age may be eligible for a maximum of 3 years overall participation on Community Employment (CE). Eligible persons of 55 or over may be eligible to a maximum of 6 years overall participation on CE. Persons in receipt of any of the 4 disability-linked Social Welfare payments may be eligible for 1 additional year's participation. Only time spent on CE since the 3rd April 2000 counts towards these participation limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">Participation on Community Employment has an upper age limit of 65 years of age, i.e. a CE participant/Supervisor can remain on CE until the day before their 66th birthday, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements. FÁS cannot make <i> </i>funding available to a Sponsor for any participant or Supervisor aged 66 years or over. To do so would mean that the state would effectively be double-funding both the CE place and the participant’s state pension simultaneously.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">Training allowances on full-time day courses are payable to those who are in receipt of Department of Social and Family Affairs payments including Jobseeker's Allowance/Benefit, One Parent Family Allowance, Disability Benefit and Invalidity Pension.  If a person qualifies under the criteria but does not wish to take up the option themselves, there are certain conditions under which they can do a spousal swap.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">The Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities. In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2332">I have been informed by IDA that during 2009, there has been 1 site visit by potential investors to Ballinasloe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">As part of its strategy to attract inward investment, IDA Ireland introduces a prospective client company to 3 or 4 selected locations, which can meet the company's requirements for skills, labour, site and/or building(s), and infrastructure. In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses. The Agency also gives priority to the Border, Midlands and West regions.  While IDA seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on location is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">In the present competitive global market, as Ireland competes for new investments at the highest end of the value chain, the concept of scale is crucial to our economic destiny.  Leading corporations require a significant population of highly qualified talent, effective physical and digital infrastructure coupled with availability of sophisticated professional support services.  If we are to continue being successful in realising a large proportion of our investments outside of the larger cities, all economic and social stakeholders will need to adhere to the framework on which the National Spatial Strategy is constructed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2336">The Forfás Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are supported by the industrial development agencies.  Data are compiled on an annualised basis and are aggregated at county level.  It is therefore not possible to provide information for individual locations throughout the country.  The survey shows that in the three-year period, 2007 to 2009 inclusive, there were a total of 1,448 new jobs created in IDA supported companies in Galway.  Details of the number of new jobs created in each of those years are set out in the attached tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">During that same period a total of 16 announcements with a potential to create in the region of 800 new jobs in IDA Ireland supported companies in Galway were made.  There were 6 IDA announcements relating to Galway in 2009 and 5 announcements in each of the years 2007 and 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">It is important to point out that there is always a time lag, often stretching over years, between the announcement of new jobs and their creation.  That time is required for activities such as locating and acquiring a suitable site for the company's operations, constructing a facility and installing machinery as well as the recruitment and training of staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">Of course, the numbers of jobs eventually created may turn out to be higher or lower than originally envisaged by the investing company as a result of developments in their product markets, general economic conditions, investment decisions and overall corporate strategy.  In addition it must be pointed out that some job creation projects go ahead without an announcement being made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2508">The availability of Employment Services Officers to meet the public varies from office to office and is determined to a great extent by the office staffing level, the demand for the service and certain outreach initiatives covered by the office, e.g. servicing clinics in other locations. However most offices are open to the public from Monday to Friday and provide an interview service to the public on a walk-in basis or by appointment.  In addition, each office meets with clients, on an appointment basis, who were referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP).  ESOs also schedule these clients, among others, for follow up interviews and discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">FÁS is prioritising the allocation of resources to its front line services through an internal redeployment of staff to service the needs of a significant increase in the number of jobseekers presenting to FÁS offices and to meet the substantial increase in the number of clients referred to FÁS by the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the NEAP. In relation to the latter, FÁS has arranged for the direct referral of an agreed number of NEAP clients to the network of Local Employment Services (LES) as part of a major increase in interview capacity in the dual-stranded National Employment Service comprised of FÁS Employment Services and the LES.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">FÁS interviewed almost 110,000 new registrants from January to November 2009 (December data will be available shortly), including almost 65,000 clients referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs under the NEAP process. In addition and as a result of the significant increase in company closures and redundancies in 2009, FÁS provided a responsive and customised service to a vast range of companies and employees affected, e.g. Dell, SR Technics, Waterford Crystal, etc. This included the provision of one-to-one guidance support, assistance/advice with CV preparation and interview techniques, tailored individual and group training programmes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2928">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant historical information available on the incomes of employees taxed under the PAYE system is derived from income tax returns filed for the income tax year 2007 representing about 96% of all returns expected at the time the data were complied for analytical purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">On this basis the numbers of persons classified as public sector employees in Dublin City and County earning a gross income of less than €30,000 are 47,218 and 10,565 respectively. However, care needs to be exercised in relation to these figures as they include persons in receipt of various payments from public sources who would not normally be regarded as public servants e.g. those in receipt of fees, those on State Boards etc. Furthermore, the data do not distinguish earnings from atypical work patterns, work sharing or short time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2930">An estimated breakdown of the figures on a geographical basis is available on the basis of "bailiwick", meaning, in this case, the jurisdiction or boundaries within which Revenue Sheriffs, County Registrars or their officers operate for the purposes of enforcement of tax debt. It equates geographically with "county" while also providing separate breakdowns for "city" and "county" in the case of counties Dublin and Cork. The data relating to the allocation by city or county of PAYE employees should be treated with caution. This is because it has been the practice to associate each employee with the city or county in which his or her employer is registered for PAYE purposes, regardless of the address of the actual workplace or of the individual's home address<b>.</b>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2931">The source of the information provided in relation to numbers and tax is the P35 end year returns filed by employers in respect of their employees but does not include the corresponding figures relating to PAYE taxpayers who are required to return an income tax return form 11 where non-PAYE income is greater than €3,174.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2943">"The definition of a public servant in the legislation governing the pension levy and the pay reductions is the same. Therefore, in general the reductions in pay under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 will apply to employees who are paying the pension related deduction. However, there are a small number of situations where the pay reductions could apply to a public servant who was not subject to the pensions levy. The pay reductions apply to employees of public service bodies, whether or not the public servant is a member of a public service pension scheme or receives a payment in lieu. Furthermore, the income exemption threshold that applies to the pensions levy does not apply to the pay reductions.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2944">Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 apply to HSE service providers and other bodies in receipt of funding assistance from the HSE. Organisations that are directly funded by the HSE under Section 38 of the 2004 Act are public service bodies, as defined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act which provided for the pension levy deduction and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, which provided for the reduction in public service pay. Employees in these bodies have access to public service pension schemes or, in a small number of cases, the state funds an employer contribution to a private pension scheme. The pension levy and the reduction in salary apply to all these employees. Accordingly, the pay reduction legislation applies to all members of the Nominated Health Agencies Superannuation Scheme.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2945">Under Section 39 of the 2004 Act, the HSE provides a grant towards the overall costs of running certain organisations.  Neither the pension levy nor the reduction in salary applies to such employees".</p>

            <p eId="para_2964">I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under section 132 of Finance Act 1992 vehicle registration tax (VRT) is chargeable, leviable and payable on the registration of vehicles in the State.  There is no provision in law for an exemption from, or reduction in, the charge to VRT in relation to vehicles that were previously registered in another jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">VRT is charged on the open market selling price (OMSP) of a vehicle in the State.  OMSP is defined in section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.  The OMSP of new vehicles in the State is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by wholesale distributors of new vehicles, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">In order to provide the same base for the application of VRT on vehicles sourced in the State and abroad, VRT is charged on the OMSP of the vehicle and not on the purchase price of vehicles bought in other jurisdictions.  The amounts, levels or types of tax charged on a vehicle in another jurisdiction, while they might impact on the purchase price of the vehicle in that jurisdiction, are not taken into account in the calculation of the OMSP in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">From a European Union perspective, VRT is a national tax and does not contravene EU law.  Article 90 of the EC Treaty allows Member States to charge national taxes provided that there is no discrimination against imported goods in favour of indigenous goods. It provides that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2969">"No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products".</p>
            <p eId="para_2970">This principle was further underpinned by a European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgement (Case C-313/05, Maciej Brzezinski v Dyrektor Izby Celnej w Warszawie) of 18 January 2007, where the ECJ ruled in favour of Poland regarding their entitlement to charge an excise duty on the importation of second-hand vehicles into that jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">Accordingly, in the case of a vehicle brought into Ireland from another jurisdiction, VRT is payable on the registration of the vehicle in the State, irrespective of whether or not a registration (or similar) tax had been paid previously outside the State.</p>

There will be ongoing examination by the Group of individual areas to identify possible local relief measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2975">In carrying out flood mitigation works the OPW, like any other agency or individual, has no alternative but to take account of the wide-ranging environmental constraints on flood mitigation works. In particular, the OPW has to have regard to the EU Habitats Directive and other environmental legislation. Securing the necessary consents and licences for works in environmentally sensitive areas can be time consuming and not without cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_2976">The OPW liaises continually with the relevant State bodies involved in environmental protection i.e. the Fisheries Boards and, primarily, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2977">The OPW is currently in discussion with the NPWS with a view to developing a Memorandum of Understanding aimed at facilitating more efficient and streamlined decision making in relation to environmental issues affecting proposed flood relief works.

            <p eId="para_2987">I intend to transpose the EU Floods Directive by Statutory Instrument into Irish law shortly.  The effect of this is, rather than creating a single agency as suggested by the Deputy, to give to the OPW in respect of flood risk, the necessary statutory authority to ensure the participation of the stakeholders in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2988">The EU requires that the implementation of the Floods Directive and the Water Framework Directive should be closely coordinated in each Member State. This provides the basis for the development of an integrated, coordinated approach to the management of all matters relating to the River Shannon.</p>

The Deputy might wish to note that there is a provision in the Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code which imposes certain obligations on banks who have decided to close or move a branch in a given location. The relevant provision states:</p>
            <p eId="para_2991">Where a credit institution plans to close or move a branch it must inform affected consumers in writing at least 3 months in advance and advise the Financial Regulator immediately thereof. The wider local community should also be informed, in advance, through notification in the local press.</p>
            <p eId="para_2992">This advance notification requirement is designed to give existing consumers the necessary time to choose another credit institution.</p>

            <p eId="para_2994">The Freedom of Information Act (FOI), which covered 67 public bodies when it commenced in April 1998, now applies to over 500 bodies across the public sector. My Department periodically reviews the range of bodies covered by the Act and routinely engages with Government Departments about bodies under their aegis that might be considered for FOI.  Work is ongoing at present on an extension of the Act to a number of such bodies. Application of the Freedom of Information Act to a body is considered under a number of criteria, for example whether the body is in receipt of or administering, considerable public funds or is it exercising important statutory functions, funded by the State or otherwise. Other factors looked at are whether the body is in a category or sector where FOI already applies to other public bodies or where work was formerly done by a Government department and is now done by a state agency. Each case is considered on its own particular merits and the range of bodies remaining outside of FOI is kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3102">I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which commenced earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3103">Following the announcement of the ECCE scheme in the April 2009 Supplementary Budget, information in relation to the scheme has been available from my Office either through direct contact or from the website www.omcya.ie.  From May 2009, information in relation to the scheme has also been available from the 33 City and County Childcare Committees which assist my Office in implementing the scheme and are well placed to provide additional information and local details to parents.  The City and County Childcare Committees have also been proactive in promoting the scheme at local level including holding information nights for parents and pre-school service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3104">In June of last year, my Office wrote to all pre-school services notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) and registered with the Irish Montessori Educational Board (IMEB) with further details of the scheme and inviting them to apply.  This was followed in July 2009 by the issue of an information leaflet entitled "Guide for Parents to the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)" and covering letter to all parents of children who would qualify for the scheme in January 2010.  The leaflet provided information in relation to the scheme to inform parents and assist them with enrolling their children in their local participating pre-school services.  Contact details for the 33 City and County Childcare Committees were also included.</p>
            <p eId="para_3105">Approximately 4,000 pre-school services are participating in the scheme and many of these have actively advertised that they would be participating in the scheme and providing free pre-school year places.  Participating services are currently making a return to my Office giving details of the children enrolled with them for the pre-school year.  To ensure that parents of qualifying children are fully aware of the scheme and the deadline for enrolment, advertisements highlighting the fact that the scheme is closing to January 2010 applicants, were recently placed by my Office in 2 Sunday and 42 regional newspapers.  In addition, I was interviewed by local, regional and national radio about the scheme in the first two weeks of January.  National television and the national print media also carried interviews with me and features on the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3106">The first full year of the ECCE scheme will commence in September 2010 and I would anticipate that a further information leaflet for parents of qualifying children will be issued by my Office in May of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3108">The Health Service Executive, with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3109">The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_3110">The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices (LHOs) in Dublin to the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3111">The HSE has advised that the transfer of the case load from the two LHOs included a backlog of some 6,500 cases.  These are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS.  As a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is providing additional resources to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">In 2009, the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications.  This included nearly 42,000 reviews.  In relation to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 days and 95% within 30 days.  The HSE has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_3113">The HSE intends to transfer the processing of all new medical/GP visit card applications and new reviews/renewals from the other LHOs to the PCRS in April this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3114">Any applications/reviews received before the date of transfer will be dealt with by the relevant LHO.  The HSE is currently putting arrangements in place to track the time taken by each local health office to process applications.  I have asked for a report on this issue to be submitted to me by the end of this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3115">The HSE has recently launched a facility — www.medicalcard.ie — where a person who has applied through the PCRS can view the status of their medical GP visit card application or review online, using a unique reference number that is provided on the acknowledgement sent to them.  If a mobile telephone number is supplied with the application/review, an acknowledgement of receipt and the application status/progress of the case will automatically be delivered to the applicant by text message as their case proceeds through the assessment process.  The PCRS is also finalising the development of a facility which will allow people to apply on-line if they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_3116">The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, the initiative to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals will ensure:</p>
            <p eId="para_3117">Improved turnaround times for processing of applications: under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately; Consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision;  Clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information; and A reduction in the overall number of staff required to process medical/GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">My Department has been in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.  A letter has issued to all Oireachtas members yesterday in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3119">The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE show that there were 1,478,560 medical card holders on 31st December 2009, approximately 23% of whom are persons aged 70 or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_3120">The other issues raised by the Deputy are operational matters.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3148">The external review of laboratory services, which was conducted for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services in 2007, highlighted limitations in the current organisation of laboratories.  These limitations had an adverse effect on quality, turnaround time and cost.  The review found that "the whole system quality" of laboratories was not of a sufficiently high standard.  The review also found that the overall proportion of individual laboratory medicine disciplines that had achieved accreditation status was low, "end-to-end" information systems were unsatisfactory and logistic services were inadequate.  It found as well that the general condition of the laboratory estate typically was traditionally designed and outmoded.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">In light of the review, the HSE announced plans early last year to modernise laboratory services and to introduce significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of these services.  The HSE has already had significant engagement with stakeholders in progressing this initiative.  Groups such as the Faculty of Pathology and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association will have a continuing input into the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">I am also pleased to say that some improvements in laboratory service have taken place since the completion of the review.  The number of individual laboratory disciplines which have been accredited has increased significantly.  In addition, some reconfiguration of laboratory services has been achieved by transferring work undertaken in a number of small laboratories to larger laboratories.  This allows for a higher level of throughput.  I want to acknowledge the important role of staff and other stakeholders in effecting these changes and to the shared commitment of all to the objective of high quality laboratory services.</p>

The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3290">When Exchequer grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation, at central level, to deal with weather contingencies.  Holding back such an allocation would mean a reduction in the road grant allocations made to all local authorities at the beginning of each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3291">The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised in the annual road grants circular letter that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">The amount of money provided in the 2010 Estimates for funding regional and local roads is €411.177 million and this year's allocation will be based on that amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">I have, however, asked local authorities to provide details of exceptional road related costs associated with the November 2009 flooding and recent prolonged severe weather, which fall outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance. I will have regard to this information when deciding on the allocations.  I will announce the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations by mid February 2010 at the latest.</p>

However, some of these roads may require more extensive works, which will be undertaken when weather conditions are more favourable.  In the meantime, as my colleagues and I have stressed in all recent press briefings on the severe weather, road users need to be extremely vigilant and to drive responsibly. This message has also been given out via the press and websites by agencies such as the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority. Care also needs to be exercised by pedestrians, in view of the damage suffered to footpaths.</p>

            <p eId="para_3298">The mode share of public transport as a means of travel to work is approximately 9%.  Significant investment continues to be made in the delivery of enhanced public transport infrastructure.  Over €600m in Exchequer capital has been provided in 2010 to progress rail, light rail, metro and traffic management projects.  The Cork Commuter rail project and the Luas extension to the Docklands were completed in 2009.  In 2010 the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor, the Kildare Route Project and phase 1 of the Navan Line will be completed.  In addition, Real Time Passenger Information for bus services will be rolled out in Dublin and Cork.  Good progress also continues to be made in the delivery of Integrated Ticketing.  These developments combined with progress in the planning of projects such as Metro North and DART Underground will continue the process of delivering high quality public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3299">In addition, the Government's sustainable transport policy, SMARTER Travel, envisages a significant increase in public transport usage and in cycling and walking in preference to the private car.  However, in the current difficult economic climate, it must be recognized that public services need to be delivered in as cost efficient and effective manner as possible.  Bus Éireann and the other CIÉ companies will have to take measures to address reduced revenue and ensure their continued financial stability. These measures, combined with investment in public transport infrastructure, will provide a basis for a high quality and economically sustainable public transport system.</p>

            <p eId="para_3325">The circumstances surrounding the import of an explosive substance to Ireland from the Slovak Republic on 2 January 2010 are a matter of serious concern to me and the Government.  The background to this incident is that the Garda Síochána were contacted by the Dublin Airport Authorities on 5 January 2010 informing them that they had received a communication purporting to be from the Slovak Authorities apparently to the effect that, due to an error during an airport security test exercise at Poprad-Tatry Airport on 2 January 2010, a sample package containing explosives was left in the luggage of a passenger who boarded a flight for Dublin. The Gardaí moved swiftly to recover the substance and, with the assistance of the Army, ensured it did not pose any future danger to the public.  It emerged that the passenger, who has resided in Ireland for a number of years, was completely unaware when he was travelling to Dublin that the sample had been placed in his luggage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">I spoke directly with the Slovak Interior Minister about this matter and he apologised for the incident.  I conveyed to him in no uncertain terms my clear concern about the situation which had arisen. It is utterly unacceptable that explosive material should have been placed on an unsuspecting passenger in this way.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">The Garda Commissioner has appointed a Detective Chief Superintendent to inquire into all the circumstances surrounding the incident.  That inquiry is ongoing and a report is awaited. Until that report is available, it is not possible to say for definite how the error occurred in Slovakia and what actions were taken by the authorities there when the error was discovered.  When the report is completed I will consider what further action, if any, is required on my part.</p>

            <p eId="para_3795">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers.  At the end of 2009, a total of 54 centres throughout the country accommodating 6,494 persons seeking international protection were under contract to the RIA.  As part of the management of this process, the RIA advertises annually in the national press for expressions of interest from persons interested in providing accommodation and ancillary services for asylum seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">In fulfilling its responsibilities in respect of the accommodation of asylum seekers, the RIA does not acquire or ‘lease' premises.  Rather it engages contractors to provide a comprehensive range of services, which include accommodation, catering, housekeeping, etc., for a fixed period of time.  When engaging in the contracting process the RIA is primarily concerned with achieving best value for taxpayers' money and also with achieving as wide a spread as is possible of asylum seekers evenly throughout the State.  For these and for other, commercial, reasons, it has not been the practice up to now to divulge whether a particular location is the subject of contractual negotiations, and it is not proposed to depart from this long standing practice on this occasion.</p>

The population of each County as per the 2006 Census drawn from the website of the Central Statistics Office (<i>www.cso.ie</i>) is also shown in a separate table.  The Commissioner is in the process of re-aligning Garda Divisional boundaries to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  As a consequence of this work, the geographical areas of Garda Divisions, districts and sub-district stations were also realigned while at the same time ensuring that service delivery to the community was maintained to the highest possible standard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3951">The Government's Rapid Response Corps is a roster of skilled and experienced volunteers who make themselves available to deploy at short notice to work in humanitarian emergency situations.  The Corps comprises 130 individuals with specialised skills in logistics, engineering, public health, humanitarian coordination and protection.  Most will have worked extensively overseas in humanitarian and/or development settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3952">Individual members of the Corps are deployed at the request of the UN and other humanitarian organisations in need of their specific skills.  Those agencies and organisations have the requisite knowledge and experience to determine where gaps exist and how to use Irish personnel optimally.  Immediately following the Haiti earthquake Rapid Response Corps members were requested by my Department to indicate their availability to deploy to the earthquake zone. We have quickly deployed an electrical engineer and an IT expert to the World Food Programme.  We expect that further deployments of the Corps will take place over the coming days and weeks.  One of the lessons of the international community's response to the 2004 Tsunami was that the mass deployment of volunteers, while well-intentioned, can often hamper relief efforts.  Consequently our Rapid Response Corps has been designed to quickly provide highly-specialised skills as and when requested by those leading the relief effort.  This model is regarded as best practice in the humanitarian community.  Since 2007, there have been 65 deployments of the Corps to more than 20 countries. Members of the Corps are working in Afghanistan, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Sudan.</p>

            <p eId="para_3956">I share the Deputy's concern at the sequence of events which led to members of the Garda Síochána recovering a quantity of explosive material which had inadvertently been brought into Ireland in the luggage of a passenger who had flown into Dublin from the Slovak Republic on 2 January.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has asked the Garda Commissioner for a full report on the matter. I understand that the Commissioner has appointed a Chief Superintendent to investigate fully the circumstances surrounding the incident. As the investigation remains ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the particulars of the incident and the investigation itself at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3957">Following the incident, I spoke by phone to my Slovak counterpart. I stressed the seriousness with which the Government viewed the incident and my colleague offered his apologies for what had happened. Earlier, the Slovak Minister for the Interior had spoken to the Minister for Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to convey his Government's profound regret for this incident.  The Ambassador of the Slovak Republic to Ireland had contacted officials from my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform further expressing regret in relation to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3958">There can be no doubt that the Slovak authorities are fully aware of the seriousness with which we in Ireland view this incident.  Notwithstanding this, Ireland retains, and wishes to continue to retain, a positive, friendly and fruitful relationship with the Slovak Republic, which is a fellow member of the European Union.</p>

            <p eId="para_3995">As I outlined previously to the House, my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the Local Development Social Inclusion (LDSIP) and Community Development Programmes (CDP), drawing on good international practice and to support the ongoing evaluation of the programmes.<b/>Both programmes have a community development element and were delivered through separate local delivery structures.  These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and have been superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  This will be underpinned by four high level goals:</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">To promote awareness, knowledge and uptake of a wide range of statutory, voluntary and community services</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">To increase access to formal and informal educational, recreational and cultural development activities and resources</p>
            <p eId="para_3999">To increase peoples' work readiness and employment prospects</p>
            <p eId="para_4000">To promote engagement with policy, practice and decision-making processes on matters affecting local communities. The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the CDP/LDSIP Programmes and will enable groups to objectively demonstrate the positive impacts they are securing for local communities.  An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway in preparation for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4001">In advance of proceeding to establish a single programme across CDPs and Partnerships, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual community development projects.  Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities.  The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve.  The vast majority of projects fall into this category and have been offered funding under the new programme in 2010.  Where projects were not recommended for continued funding, an appropriate appeals mechanism has been provided.  I understand the project referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal and that officials from my Department have been in touch with them in this regard.  It is intended that the appeals process would be completed before end-January 2010 and during that period temporary funding has been provided in respect of the basic running costs of projects under appeal, i.e., grant towards salaries and appropriate overheads.</p>

        <b>Deputy Tom Hayes</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
         the amount that has been allocated to RAPID funding in south Tipperary every year since 2004 to date in 2010; the projects that have received funding; the projects that will receive funding for 2010; the number of full-time staff employed by RAPID in south Tipperary; and if he will make a statement regarding the impact of RAPID funding on south Tipperary as assessed by his Department.

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4003">The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the designated RAPID areas nationally.  As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the Programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section —  http://www.pobal.ie/Funding%20Programmes/Rapid/ Pages/Funding.aspx — and the Deputy may find it useful to access this information. I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and support projects that focus on estate management, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds.  The table sets out details of RAPID leverage funding by my Department in south Tipperary from 2004 to date.  Ongoing co-funding of projects approved under the schemes will continue in 2010, subject to resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">I am satisfied that the impact of the programme has facilitated RAPID communities in south Tipperary in taking greater ownership of local development, and has also enabled state organisations to work together to improve the quality of life for local people.</p>

            <p eId="para_4124">The Department currently maintains four websites.  The Department's main website, www.welfare.ie, contains information on the range of schemes and services provided by the Department, as well as policy publications and online services. Support and maintenance costs for the website and associated content management system in 2009 were €47,248.  In 2009 there were over 2.75m unique visits to www.welfare.ie.  Responsibility for the General Register Office, and the www.groireland.ie website, was transferred from the Department of Health and Children to the Department from January 1st, 2008.  The maintenance cost for 2009 was €987.52.  Statistics for number of unique visits in 2009 is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy when available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4125">Following the integration of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion in a new Social Inclusion Division within the Department in July 2009, the Department also maintains and updates content on www.socialinclusion.ie and www.combatpoverty.ie.  A project has commenced on the custodian and archiving responsibilities arising from the closing down of www.socialinclusion.ie and www.combatpoverty.ie.  This will involve the transfer of relevant information to a new area on www.welfare.ie.  It is necessary to retain these two sites until this work is complete and it is expected that they will be shut down before the second quarter of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4126">The costs for 2009 for www.socialinclusion.ie was €232.07.  In 2009 the site had 57,309 unique visits.  The costs for 2009 for www.combatpoverty.ie was €423.75. In 2009 the site had 93,307 unique visits.  I am satisfied that the integration of the Combat Poverty and Social Inclusion websites with the Department's main website will provide customers with a single, highly accessible repository for information on both the Department's range of services and on the social policy research and reports that inform the development of social welfare policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4129">I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 248 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4130">Child benefit (CB) is a tax free non means tested benefit paid monthly in respect of all children up to the age 16 years and in respect of children over 16 years of age up to their 18th birthday who are in full time education or have a disability.  Child Benefit assists parents in the cost associated with raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4131">It was decided in Budget 2009 to limit spending on Child Benefit by lowering the upper age limit that currently applies from 19 years to 18 years.  The impact of this measure was phased in, with payment for existing and future qualifying children being halved from January 2009 and payment stopping from the 18th birthday from January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4132">A compensatory payment of €15 was provided during 2009 and will continue in 2010 for any week during which those affected by this measure are receiving a social welfare payment which includes an increase in respect of the 18 year old child or a family income supplement payment which includes payment in respect of that child.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">Calculation of child poverty for SILC is measured as the proportion of all children aged 17 years or younger who live in households that have an income below the 60 per cent of median income poverty line and it is not expected that a measure directed at those over 18 years will have an impact on this measure. Results from the most recent survey of Income and Living Conditions in Ireland (IRL-SILC) 2008 survey published in Nov 2009 showed the consistent poverty rate for children, aged 0-17, decreased from 7.4% in 2007 to 6.3% in 2008.  The percentage of children ‘at risk of poverty' fell by almost two per cent, from 19.9% in 2007 to 18% in 2008.  These are the most recent figures SILC figures available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation.  Statistics in relation to the number of extra claims — if any — arising from the impact of the changes in child benefit scheme are not maintained by the community welfare division of the HSE and accordingly it is not possible to supply statistics in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">In recognition of the need to target limited available resources at persons on low incomes with children in full-time education, a number of provisions have been introduced including:</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">The extension of entitlement to Increase for Qualified Child, payable to social welfare recipients in respect of qualifying child dependants, to age 22 where the parent of a full-time student (including third level) is in receipt of either:</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">A long-term social welfare payment, or</p>

            <p eId="para_4139">The provision of a weekly payment to low paid employees with families, through the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  Under this scheme, a qualified child is any child under the age of 18 or aged 18 to 22 in full-time education.  This supplement is paid where a family's weekly income is below a specified amount for the family size, and is calculated at 60% of the difference between the net family income (i.e. gross pay less tax, PRSI, health contribution, superannuation) and the relevant income limit.</p>

            <p eId="para_4154">The Department assists social welfare recipients with heating costs, through their basic payments, the fuel allowance scheme and the household benefits package of electricity and gas allowances.  The household benefits package is payable throughout the year to almost 380,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households to assist them with their heating, light and cooking costs.  This scheme cost approximately €200 million in 2009.  In addition, the national fuel allowance scheme helps householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments to meet the additional cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full and must be seen in the context of the overall level of income available to the family.  In budget 2009, the duration of the payment was increased by an extra two weeks to 32 weeks, while the weekly value of the allowance was increased by €2 to €20 a week, or €23.90 in designated smokeless areas.  This compares with just €14 and €17.90 respectively in 2006.  These are in addition to other improvements made in recent years, including a significant increase in the income threshold for the allowance with effect from 2008.  A single person aged under 80, with a household income of less than €330.30 a week can now qualify for the fuel allowance.  The income limits for couples are €483.80 a week where the qualified adult is aged under 66 and €536.80 a week where both adults are aged over 66.  As a result of these improvements, almost 318,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2009 at an estimated cost of €217 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4155">In addition to the basic welfare payments, household benefits and fuel allowance payments highlighted above, the Department also provides funding to the Community Welfare Service to assist people with special heating needs.  Community welfare officers can pay a heating supplement to people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.  They can also make exceptional needs payments to people who do not have enough money to meet their heating costs.  Since the onset of the adverse weather conditions, community welfare officers have provided assistance to people to purchase additional fuel, heaters and clothing.  They have also given funding towards the payment of heating bills and for repairs arising from burst pipes.  Over €170,000 has been paid out since 1 January 2010 in respect of such claims.  Assistance will continue to be provided towards the payment of heating bills for those in need.  Paying a special increase in response to the bad weather would not necessarily represent a good targeting of limited resources.  Rather, it is considered desirable to continue to give the CWOs the discretion and the funding to assist people who need extra financial support.</p>

            <p eId="para_4196">Emergency planning in this country is developed on the "lead Department" principle.  This means that each Department is responsible for planning for and responding to those emergencies that fall within its area of responsibility.  In my capacity of Chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I brought a document, Roles and Responsibilities in Emergency Planning, to the Government in December 2008.  This document, for the first time, identified the lead Department and the supporting Departments and agencies in over 40 emergency scenarios.  It was prepared by the Office of Emergency Planning and was agreed by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.  The Framework for Major Emergency Management is the document that sets out a structure enabling the principal response agencies (the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the Local Authorities) to prepare for, and make a co-ordinated response to, major emergencies resulting from events such as fires, transport accidents, hazardous substance incidents and severe weather.  The framework states that a major emergency is any event which, with little or no warning, causes or threatens death or injury, serious disruption of essential services or damage to property, the environment or infrastructure beyond the normal capabilities of the principal emergency services in the area in which the event occurs, and requires the activation of specific additional procedures and the mobilisation of additional resources to ensure an effective, co-ordinated response.  The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning supports co-ordination of emergency planning across Departments and key agencies. It provides a forum for sharing information and keeping emergency planning high on the agenda of all Government Departments.  As the chairman of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I receive regular updates from the national steering group on progress made in the implementation of the framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_4198">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region.  In accordance with the roles assigned to them by the Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to search and rescue.  In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.  As in all cases of services that the Defence Forces can provide in support to the civil authorities, the services are demand-led and provided on an "as available basis", having regard to current and contingent Defence Forces operational commitments.  It should be noted that the Defence Forces had adequate resources to deal with requests for assistance in the rescue of civilian personnel during the recent periods of flooding and severe weather across the country.  This included the transportation of civilian personnel from flood-affected areas in Defence Forces vehicles.  I am satisfied that the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are fully equipped to meet the roles assigned to them by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_4200">The Deputy will appreciate that in the context of the current disaster in Haiti there are a number of responses that can be made by Ireland, the EU, and other international organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4201">The immediate EU response to the earthquake in Haiti and its terrible consequences was dealt with at an emergency meeting of EU Development Ministers on Monday of this week attended by my colleague the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Peter Power.  The EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton has undertaken to co-ordinate the response with the US and UN authorities. The EU has pledged €122 million in immediate humanitarian assistance in response to the Haiti disaster.</p>
            <p eId="para_4202">The EU has a wide range of instruments, both civilian and military, which it can use to come to the aid of people in difficulties.  The EU is constantly increasing its various capabilities, including its ability to response quickly to catastrophes.  After the meeting in Brussels on Monday Minister of State Power emphasised the importance for the EU as a whole to learn from the experience of the response to this disaster. This will include addressing the rapid response capability of the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_4203">Minister of State Power is co-ordinating the Irish pledges of assistance to Haiti.  Ireland is contributing €20 million to the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund. Also, Ireland is providing €2 million which is being channelled directly through Irish NGOs and UN humanitarian agencies. Earlier this week, a consignment of over 80 tons of essential humanitarian supplies was freighted to Haiti, this is one of the largest consignments of humanitarian supplies ever provided directly by Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4204">Ireland is also deploying two highly-skilled members of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps to assist the World Food Programme, others are on standby and are expected to be called upon over the coming days and weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_4212">The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces. This investment has been facilitated by the re-investment both of pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000 and proceeds from the sale of surplus properties. The level of investment has ensured that Defence Forces personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry our their day-to-day roles at home and overseas. I will ensure that this investment will continue as much as possible, taking the changed economic circumstances into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_4213">On the issue of training, I am very satisfied that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them by Government. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.</p>

The scheme, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, is open to all owners of existing homes built before 2006 and eligible works include the provision of roof and wall insulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4229">As part of an ongoing focus on major emergency preparedness and response, the Government, in 2006, published a Framework for Major Emergency Management. The purpose of the new Framework is to put in place arrangements that will enable the three principal response agencies, namely, An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the local authorities to coordinate their efforts in the event of a major emergency. The Government put in place a Major Emergency Development Programme to implement these new arrangements which led to the three principal response agencies adopting new major emergency plans in September, 2008. My Department chairs a National Steering Group to oversee and drive this Programme and to maintain the Framework into the future. I am satisfied that sufficient resources are deployed in the relevant areas in my Department to perform its emergency planning and management role. The level of resources to be deployed locally is a matter for local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4230">In relation to the recent severe weather event, there was no delay in monitoring the event as it developed. Local authorities were engaged in keeping the main national roads open to traffic from the latter part of December. When the position deteriorated after Christmas I arranged for the convening of the National Emergency Co-ordination Committee to provide a forum for the various Departments and agencies to exchange information on dealing with the event, ensure co-operation between the Departments and agencies, the Defence Forces and voluntary bodies and to enable decisions required at national level on various matters to be made where necessary. At all times, the co-ordination and inter- agency arrangements set out in the Framework document were implemented at local level by the principal response agencies working with other statutory and voluntary bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_4234">The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established as an independent statutory body in September 2004 and has as one of its principal functions the registration of private rental tenancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4235">While I have no function in the operational matters of the PRTB, I understand that at 31 December 2009, the PRTB had 234,582 active tenancies on its register, representing 399,283 tenants and 116,577 landlords.  It should be noted, however, that these tenancy data are compiled on a rolling, aggregate basis, according as valid tenancy registration forms are submitted to the PRTB, and more than one tenancy may be registered in respect of a rented accommodation unit in any year. Furthermore the Act provides for a four year tenancy cycle and the re-registration of the tenancy at the end of each cycle. In addition the number of tenancies registered each year cannot be taken as a definitive proxy indicator of annualised lettings as there are certain classes of dwellings that do not fall within the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">Further information from the PRTB's published register, including a breakdown by county, is available on the Board's website at www.prtb.ie/pubregister.htm.</p>
            <p eId="para_4237">My Department provides significant resources, from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, to assist local authorities in discharging their enforcement functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. Over €4 million was allocated in respect of 2009, linked largely to enforcement performance, bringing total funding allocations since 2004 to €15m. Details of the number of inspections carried out by each local authority in 2008 are published in my Department's 2008 Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin, which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie and in the Oireachtas Library.  I expect inspection data for 2009 to be available by mid-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4238">In recent years, there have been considerable achievements by almost all housing authorities in increasing the number of inspections of rented accommodation carried out each year and enforcement remains key to the success of the Regulations and to eliminating sub-standard accommodation from the rental sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4239">I recently announced the coming into effect on 1 December 2009 of the final elements of the package of measures approved by the Government last year to update and effectively enforce the minimum standards regulations for the private rented sector. The newly-strengthened sanctions regime provides for the issue by housing authorities of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices on foot of breaches by landlords of the minimum standards regulations. Housing authorities are aware of all the options available to them when enforcing the regulations and where necessary, they may pursue offenders through the Courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_4262">The Water Services Investment Programme has focused over the past ten years on improving the quality and capacity of water services infrastructure to meet the needs of the growing population and economic demand, and to address environmental compliance.  The upgrading of existing water mains and the provision of new mains have arisen both in the context of new or upgraded infrastructure in water supply projects financed under the general Water Services Investment Programme as well as projects undertaken under the Water Conservation Sub-Programme.  Total Exchequer expenditure over the past 10 years on the provision of water supply infrastructure, including water mains rehabilitation, is set out in the following table.</p>

Most local authorities have completed or are close to completing the initial phases of their water conservation programmes, which involved putting water management systems in place to monitor water use and losses throughout the supply networks.  This provides the platform for intensive investment in mains rehabilitation which will be a key priority under the next phase of the Water Services Investment Programme for the period 2010-2012, which will be published early this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4328">At the request of my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has commissioned a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) on Wave, Tidal and Offshore Wind Development in Irish waters.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit in SEI is progressing the SEA with the assistance of expert technical advice.  The process is being overseen by a Steering Group which comprises my Department, SEI, the Marine Institute and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4329">The SEA will underpin the Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan, which will inform the development consent framework for future offshore renewable energy projects.  The SEA will provide an environmental assessment at a strategic high level.  Under the relevant EU Directive individual projects are still required to carry out specific environmental impact assessments (EIAs.)  Environmental Impact Statements already submitted with the current applications for foreshore leases, may be taken into account in the SEA.</p>
            <p eId="para_4330">Under the Foreshore and Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Act 2009, responsibility for certain foreshore functions transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with effect from 15 January 2010.  This includes all energy related developments (including oil, gas, wind, wave and tidal energy) on the foreshore.  Both the Offshore Renewable Energy Plan and the Strategic Environmental Assessment will encompass and recognise existing offshore wind projects and those projects with foreshore lease applications at an advanced stage and in the GATE 3 process.  The requisite permissions for those projects will continue to be progressed while the SEA process is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4338">There are currently 153 wind farm projects proceeding through the Gate 3 process.  The list of Renewable Projects in Gate 3 has been published by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and available on its website (http://www.cer.ie).</p>
            <p eId="para_4339">There are 10 Wind Farm projects in Gate 3 located in the Galway area.  The total capacity applied for is 407.59 MW.  8 of these projects are due to receive offers under the Gate programme before the end of October 2010 and the remaining two are scheduled to receive offers before the end of June 2011.  Following the execution of the offer, details of the next steps in consents and construction are discussed with the applicant.  The decision document, referred to above, was issued by the CER (CER-09077).  It sets out standard lead times and charges as guidance for applicants as to the time involved in the development of their connection to the system.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4376">The regulation of electricity network charges is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  I have no function in setting these tariffs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4377">The CER reduced the network charges for all domestic and business customers from May 1st 2009 which resulted in an average decrease of electricity bills of 10.3%.  This brought forward from the autumn an anticipated reduction in energy prices.  At the time, the CER stated that the network charges would have to be increased from October.  As a result distribution and transmission charges for all domestic and business customers rose from 1st October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4378">For the majority of customers, including those on regulated ESB tariffs, the increased network charges have been more than offset by the overall reductions in energy charges arising from the decline in fossil fuel prices, with a result that low voltage maximum demand users (who tend to be small and medium size enterprises), who had remained on regulated ESB tariffs experienced an average price decrease of a further 5.5% from 1st October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4379">Most SMEs in the LVMD category are with the independent electricity suppliers.  The CER advises that some of these customers signed contracts with their suppliers that fixed their energy costs for a period but remained subject to changes in network charges.  It is this category of customers that are experiencing a rise in their electricity bills.  Although all electricity suppliers were fully aware that network charges were increasing in October, the CER advises that it has received complaints from some SME customers who consider that they had not been put on notice by their suppliers of the forthcoming change in network charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4380">On foot of the complaints, the CER has launched an investigation into how these recent network charge increases were communicated to these customers by their electricity suppliers.  It must be emphasised that the CER has no role in the terms of the contracts entered into by business customers with independent suppliers.  I welcome CER's decision to investigate the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4381">According to the latest statistics on European energy cost competitiveness, published by Eurostat, Ireland's competitive position on electricity prices is improving considerably.  Ireland registered the third largest price drop in electricity prices to industry over the 12 month period ending 30 June 2009.  At the same time, 22 of the 27 EU countries experienced price increases.  It is also the case that some of the larger industrial customers in Ireland paid less for electricity in Ireland than equivalent customers in Britain in the first half of 2009.  Given Ireland's dependence upon imported fossil fuels, widely dispersed population and need for considerable catch up investment in the networks, this is positive news for these industrial customers from a competitiveness perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_4382">Competition among the suppliers is a critical means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices.  For competition to be fully effective, business customers should be informed of all the options open to them.  My Department, the CER and Sustainable Energy Ireland are working with IBEC to ensure that business is better equipped to understand and manage their energy bills.  Business customers can now choose among a number of suppliers and the advice to them is ensure that they negotiate the best offer available.</p>

            <p eId="para_4447">In view of the prevailing economic situation cuts had to be made in all sectors in the 2008 Budget and my Department was not immune from these cuts. However, these cutbacks were kept to a minimum in so far as my Department was concerned and every effort has been made to minimize their impact on farmers since.  The Deputy will be aware of the reasons for the reduction in the budget for the 2009 Disadvantaged Areas and Suckler Welfare Schemes, notwithstanding which total expenditure in 2009 by my Department amounted to over €3.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4448">In relation to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme the necessary savings were achieved by reducing the maximum area limit to 34 hectares. However, almost two-thirds of Disadvantaged Areas Scheme beneficiaries were not affected by this reduction. The total value of payments made under this Scheme to Galway herd owners in 2008 was €29.35 million, while payments made, to date, in respect of the 2009 Scheme amount to €25.77 million. Payments are ongoing in respect of the 2009 Scheme as outstanding applications are processed to conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4449">In excess of €6m has been paid to Galway herd-owners for animals registered during 2008 under the Suckler Welfare Scheme. Almost 100,000 animals were registered under this scheme during that year. No payments have been made to date in respect of animals registered in 2009. However, despite the reduction in the amount paid per animal under the Scheme, in excess of 90,000 animals born during 2009 have been registered to date, which demonstrates that the Scheme is still considered by the applicants to be very worthwhile.</p>
            <p eId="para_4450">Furthermore, the Deputy will also recall my decision to introduce the Uplands Sheep Payment in 2009, in recognition of the need for specific support for this sector; payments under the UPS to Galway herd owners amount to €0.295 million, with payments continuing to issue on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4451">In the case of farm development schemes, no reductions in aid took place in either 2008 or 2009.   The Sow Housing (Animal Welfare) Scheme was closed for new applications in April 2008 as the applications received had reached the level of funding allocated to the Scheme by the 2007-2013 Rural Development Programme.  In addition, a decision was taken in February 2009 to defer the remaining grant payments under the Farm Waste Management Scheme on the basis of 40 per cent in 2009 as claims are approved, with the remaining instalments of 40 per cent and 20 per cent being paid in 2010 and 2011 respectively.  I also announced at that time that an ex gratia payment not exceeding 3.5 per cent of the value of the deferred amount would be made to farmers whose Farm Waste Management grants were partially deferred.  This payment will be made in January 2011 along with the final instalment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4465">Mindful of the hardship and distress caused by the recent widespread flooding, on 27 November 2007 I announced the introduction of the Fodder Aid Scheme, targeted directly at those farmers who encountered damage to fodder in the affected areas, for which I assigned a budget of €2 million. While I was very anxious that the funding reach the affected farmers as quickly as possible, it was essential that farmers demonstrate that their fodder was damaged and to what extent. To this end, therefore, it was necessary that each claim be verified by an on-the-spot inspection. I had initially set the closing date for receipt of applications as 11 December, but subsequently extended it by one week. Immediately applications began to be received by my Department, the necessary inspections were begun, following which the applications were further processed for payment. I am pleased to say that payments commenced issuing on 18 December and, to date, payments worth €464,468 have issued to 215 applicants nationally, of which, payments worth €213,135 have been made to 89 Galway herd-owners. Nationally, the payments made are worth an average of €2,160, while in Galway the average, to date, is €2,395. Further payments continue to issue as individual cases are confirmed eligible.</p>

            <p eId="para_6252">Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the schemes. With effect from the academic year 2010/11, students entering or progressing to a new course will no longer be eligible to hold both BTEA orVTOS allowances together with a student maintenance grant.  These students may continue to apply to be assessed to have the cost of the student service charge and any tuition fees paid on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_6253">It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the BTEA or VTOS allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_6267">It was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both the Back to Education Allowance and a student maintenance grant simultaneously as this represents a duplication of income support payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6268">The Deputy will appreciate that many categories of applicants apply for funding under the maintenance grant schemes.  My Department does not collate information specifically on students in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance scheme only.</p>
            <p eId="para_6269">Students currently in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the schemes.  With effect from the academic year 2010-11, students entering or progressing to a new course will no longer be eligible to hold the Back to Education Allowance together with a student maintenance grant.  These students may continue to apply to be assessed to have the cost of the student service charge and any tuition fees paid on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_6270">The Back to Education Allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce.  Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and  administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_6272">The Higher Education Authority has provisionally indicated a 6% increase in new entrants to third level education between the academic year 2008-2009 and 2009-2010.  Information from the Central Applications Office also confirms that attendance in third level education is being maintained and has, in fact, increased.  In 2008, the number of applications was 68,809 while the number in 2009 was 74,621.  In addition there was a 7.7% increase from 17/1/2009 to 17/1/2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6273">In relation to the introduction of a form of third-level student contribution, my officials prepared a technical report, at my request, on this issue.  I have referred the technical report to the strategy group which is working on a national strategy for higher education.  This report will input to the strategy group's broader deliberations on how any additional resource requirements for delivering on a new vision and related set of policy objectives for the sector can be met over the timeframe of the new strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6274">In relation to student grants, students who qualify for maintenance grants will continue to receive substantial grant funding, together with full support for payment of the student service charge.  Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant.  In addition, some €5 million will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</p>

            <p eId="para_6283">As the Deputy may be aware the position is that in the context of budgetary discussions regarding overall funding and proposals for fee changes at a sectoral level, third level institutions are autonomous bodies and may determine the level of fees to be charged in cases where the free fees schemes do not apply.  As such, post-graduate level fees are set by individual higher education institutions.  The Deputy may also appreciate that the need for  budgetary adjustment has made it necessary to reduce the level of student maintenance grants for all qualifying students, including postgraduate students.</p>
            <p eId="para_6284">The funding (including capital) being made available by my Department in 2009 for research and development activities amounts to some €130 million.  In the current difficult budgetary and economic climate, this funding is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to investing in the continued development of Ireland's research capacity.  The development and support of early stage researchers is one of the key priorities for this funding.  Supports for PhD students are provided under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) and the award schemes of the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.  I understand from the Higher Education Authority (HEA), who are in consultation with the research councils, that the funding being provided this year will enable a continuation of their various  scholarship and fellowship programmes, although there may be some decrease in the number of awards made in 2010 as against previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6285">One of the key objectives of research investment is the supply of PhD qualified researchers with skills closely aligned to enterprise needs.  Higher education institutions, supported by the HEA, are moving from the traditional "apprentice" model of PhD education to a structured four-year programme model.  While the PhD thesis will remain the primary focus, students will in addition to acquiring a broad knowledge of their discipline area also receive generic and transferable skills training in areas such as project management and intellectual property.  The Advisory Science Council report, referred to by the Deputy and published in December, highlights Ireland's need to maintain a competitive output of PhDs in relevant disciplines and endorses the structured programme model being adopted by the higher education institutions and the HEA.</p>

            <p eId="para_6576">Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level, and I have no plans to regulate this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_6577">Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to textbooks, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents.  However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.  School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_6578">The Deputy will be aware that the renewed programme for Government provides for funding to be made available to allow schools to provide grant assistance for books.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that €14.65 million for grant assistance for books is being made available in 2010 for schools at primary and second level.  This is an increase of €7.65 million over the €7 million which was allocated for books to DEIS schools in 2009.  I will be urging all schools to use this additional funding to put in place book rental schemes, as this is the most effective means of reducing costs for all parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_6579">My officials will be consulting with the management bodies to consider the details of how these funds will be channelled to schools having regard to the desirability of streamlining grant payments.  Schools will be advised of the arrangements following this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_6581">I should remind the Deputy that parents have the option of spreading the annual payment over two instalments payable in July and December.</p>
            <p eId="para_6582">The introduction of the annual charge which replaced the term payment system enabled Bus Éireann to streamline the payments system and the allocation of tickets.  It also ensures that route planning and seating arrangements are managed in a more efficient and cost effective manner.  Furthermore, those who pay the full annual charge, in advance, will benefit from a ticket being issued for the school year and this includes pupils on concessionary travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_6583">The increase in school transport charges is confined to eligible post-primary pupils and pupils availing of concessionary transport.  Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.  In addition, eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs will still travel free.  A maximum family rate of €650 also applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6584">It is not envisaged that there will be a change in the payment arrangements as outlined above.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6586">The average annual rental cost for a standard 80m2 temporary primary school classroom unit for 2007-08 school year was €15,428.  The average cost for the same unit in 2008-09 was €15,125, a reduction of almost 2%.  The cost per unit varies significantly depending on the location, size, type and age of each unit.  Another factor which needs to be considered is that in 2907-08 the VAT rate for rental of temporary accommodation was 21%.  In 2008-09 this rate rose to 21.5%.  Therefore, a portion of the savings in rental costs was offset by this VAT increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_6587">The amount spent on the rental of temporary accommodation in 2008 was almost €53 million.  In 2009, expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation fell significantly to €39 million, a saving of €14 million over 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6588">One change in policy that has been implemented is to grant aid the purchase (rather than rental) of temporary accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than three years.  Furthermore, since July 2008, it is my policy to offer schools being approved for grant aid for temporary accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a  permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.</p>
            <p eId="para_6589">These policies will reduce the usage of temporary accommodation and, particularly, the incidence of long term rental of prefabs and have contributed to the saving of €14 million on annual expenditure on rental of temporary accommodation in 2009 as compared to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6590">In addition, my Department has engaged a specialist firm to develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  Work is well under way and the firm of specialists is working closely with officials in the Planning and Building Unit of my Department.  The review incorporates the development of standard specifications for temporary accommodation, the development of new contractual terms to incorporate buy-out and relocation options to cater for individual local circumstances and appropriately protect the interests of the Department and school authorities.  My Department has received a draft of a new contract for the provision of temporary accommodation which is currently under consideration.  The work on the development of standard specifications is also well advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_6591">Another strand of the review is negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.  A number of these prefabs have now been bought-out and negotiations are ongoing with a view to ending rental contracts for as many schools as possible in 2010.  In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of competitive market prices.</p>

            <p eId="para_6593">I have repeatedly stated my, and the Government's, commitment to supporting Protestant education while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements for schools under Protestant management are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_6594">Indeed, it is in order to deal with the concerns expressed by some members of the Protestant community of the effect of changes to certain funding arrangements on Protestant second-level schools that I have sought to ensure the direct engagement with those involved in Protestant education in identifying and resolving issues collaboratively.</p>
            <p eId="para_6595">I have had meetings with a number of groups on this issue.  On 21 October, I met with the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools.  I extended an invitation to that committee to join a working group with my officials to identify particular measures to support the schools and consider options that might deal with their needs.  Regrettably, the committee declined my invitation.  While that is the case, discussions have taken place between senior Department officials and representatives of the Church of Ireland Bishops.  Discussions were held as recent as 13 January, and it is planned that those discussions will continue for the purpose of identifying a range of measures to address the needs of the schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_6596">I earnestly believe that it is through engagement between representatives from the Protestant education sector and my officials that solutions tailored to meet the concerns can be identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_6610">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.  The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in more than 40 selected locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics  of those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6611">Following from this detailed analysis it appears prudent to plan for the establishment of new schools to commence operation in September 2010 to meet increasing demand in nine identified areas.  Naas has been identified as one of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6612">This information has been circulated to all existing school patrons who have been invited to bring forward proposals for the expansion of existing schools or indeed to put themselves forward as Patron for any new primary school, should it be required.  The requirement for the establishment of new schools will of course be lessened where it is possible to expand and extend existing schools in those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6613">The progression of all large scale building projects will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>
