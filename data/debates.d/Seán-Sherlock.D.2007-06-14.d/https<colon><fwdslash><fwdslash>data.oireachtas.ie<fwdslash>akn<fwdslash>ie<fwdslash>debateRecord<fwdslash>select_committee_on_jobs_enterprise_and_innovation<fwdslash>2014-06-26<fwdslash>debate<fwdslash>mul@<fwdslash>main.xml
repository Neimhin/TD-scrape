          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_35">“(10B) Without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, this section does not apply to—</p>

          <p class="indent_5" eId="para_47">‘place’ includes any dwelling or any building or part of a building.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The amendment amends section 2(1A) of the 2003 Act by inserting a new paragraph (aa) and ensures the transfer of a foreign national in an intra-company transfer is clearly included in the general requirement to have an employment permit.  The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfers.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder’s employer is outside the State, that is, a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is, the Irish entity.  It is the Minister's intention that the provisions of the Bill relating to intra-company transfer employment permits respect the employer-employee contractual relationship between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference to the connected person that could suggest it was the employer has been removed and sections have been redrafted accordingly.  Many of the Committee Stage amendments are drafted to achieve this aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">The new subsection (b) provides that a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person shall not be permitted to do so except in accordance with an intra-company transfer employment permit and that to do otherwise is an offence. The new subsection (c) applies the offence provisions where a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person does not have the required intra-company transfer employment permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The new subsection (d) will provide a defence to a foreign national working without an employment permit who can prove he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with section 2. This defence is already provided in the 2003 Act to an employer who employs someone without an employment permit. This provision addresses an issue raised by Mr. Justice Hogan in his 2012 ruling in the Younis case, which he referred to the Oireachtas and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Acceptance of amendment No. 4 will involve the deletion of section 3 of the published Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The new subparagraph (e) in section 3 of the Bill applies the defence provisions of section 2(4) of the 2003 Act to the new subsection 2C. Subsection 2C makes it an explicit requirement that a foreign national employed by a foreign employer who undertakes duties for, or training with, a connected person in the State has a valid employment permit. The effect of this is to provide a defence for those charged with an offence consisting of a contravention of the new subsection 2C.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The new subparagraph (f) in subsection 3 of the Bill is required to address the variance which exists between existing employment permits legislation and the State's obligations under international agreements concerning the employment of dependants of State employees assigned on official duty overseas, often referred to as working spouse or working dependant agreements, particularly the treaty agreement in place between Ireland and the US. The amendment provides an exemption from the terms of the proposed Act for foreign nationals in the State under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 who are assigned to a mission in a country with which the Government has entered into a working dependant agreement. Under the terms of the working dependant agreement with the US and Canada, both of which predate the employment permits legislation, relevant dependants of officials assigned abroad are entitled to an authorisation to work in the other country. This system has been applied in full to Irish dependants overseas, but following the introduction of the Employment Permits Acts, applications by relevant embassies based here must be accompanied by a formal job offer, in contradiction of the terms of these international agreements. While our partners in the US and Canada implement the terms of working dependant agreements in full, our legislation as it stands means Ireland cannot fulfil its obligations to our partners. The US has noted on several occasions that Ireland's insistence on receipt of a formal job offer before issuing the employment permit is in breach of the agreement being implemented in full by the US. It is not expected that the amendment will lead to a substantial increase in non-Irish nationals seeking work under the terms of working dependant agreements. In addition, the exemption ends upon completion of the posting of the assigned person, usually a four-year duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The new subsection (g) in section 3 of the Bill assigns the definitions of new terms used in the legislation, which fall out of the treatment of the intra-company transfer situation in the Bill. I am considering further minor amendments to section 3 of the Bill and will revert on Report Stage.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_62">In page 6, line 11, to delete "following section" and substitute "following sections".</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment and consequential to the insertion of two sections in the 2003 Act, section 2B in the published Bill and section 2C under amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 6 is a drafting amendment to the new section 2B inserted into the 2003 Act by section 4 of the Bill and ensures consistency with use of the term "service" in these provisions.  With regard to amendment No. 7, I have followed the Younis case closely and we all agree it was shocking.  We were shocked at the exploitation and injustice it highlighted.  The objective of the new section 2B is to further deter employers from employing foreign nationals without an employment permit by permitting the foreign national and the Minister to take civil action for compensation against the employer, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract.  This is in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">  Deputy Tóibín's amendment deals specifically with this.  Without necessarily speaking too much on the amendment until the Deputy proposes it, it would raise the bar in terms of what a foreign national or the Minister, in deciding whether to take a case on behalf of a foreign national under the new provision, has to prove before a court to get paid compensation.  I will leave it at that until Deputy Tóibín speaks on his amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">I know it was not meant by the Minister of State, but our offices received an avalanche of amendments in recent days, which makes oversight on our part difficult.  The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to name the wrongdoing - the exploitative work practices, as such - by the employer against whom a civil action has been taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">  With regard to amendment No. 8, the legislation allows for compensation to be awarded on the basis of the minimum wage or the minimum rates provided by statute or registered employment agreements.  I understand why the Minister of State seeks to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">However, we tabled this amendment for a reason. For example, although everyone else working in a restaurant might be getting paid between €10 and €12 per hour, one waiter might only be getting the minimum wage. The compensation should reflect the real wage being paid to comparable staff members and not the minimum wage that could be expected in that sector. Otherwise, if someone seeking to exploit a person must pay compensation, that amount would still not match the cost of what should have been paid in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">Amendment No. 15 is important for us.  While we accept that the compensation will not be treated as a reckonable payment within the meaning of the social welfare legislation, a particular concern arises.  If an individual cannot access the infrastructure that the Minister of State is providing to ensure that his or her rights are achieved, the process is not worth the paper on which it is written.  If people must go a long time without being able to feed their families, pay their rents or cover other costs before judgments are made, they will be radically disempowered from raising their concerns in the first place and we will end up with hundreds more Muhammad Younis cases.  At our meeting on Tuesday, someone from the Irish Immigrant Support Centre, Nasc, indicated that 30,000 people were in this undocumented space, although not how many were experiencing these levels of exploitation.  It is important that people have the financial facility to access the process.  Otherwise, it will not be a real opportunity for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I propose to deal with the amendments numerically.  Deputy Tóibín’s amendment would place the onus on the foreign national of proving that exploitative work practices took place.  Currently, the foreign national does not have to prove that this occurred in order to avail of the provision.  Unscrupulous employers who employ illegal non-EEA nationals continue to face the possibility of prosecution under the employment permits legislation.  If found guilty of an offence, such employers face a fine of up to €250,000, imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.  An Garda Síochána and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.  On this basis, we will not accept amendment No. 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">  Regarding amendment No. 8, the new civil proceedings provide for compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract of employment – this point is important - and the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rate for the job.  These are rates provided for in law and there is no ambiguity or complex standards of proof for a court in determining how much the compensation should be.  It is also how the Labour Court determined Mr. Younis's compensation.  The Deputy’s amendment would add complexity and ambiguity to a court's determination of what the rate for a "regularised employee engaging in the same employment" would be and could actually result in the applicant's claim failing if such a rate could not be established to the court's satisfaction.  On the other hand, the national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  It would be different if the contract of employment were legal, but in such a scenario it is not.  We will not accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">  Amendment No. 9 provides for retrospective effect of the provision so that a person taking proceedings pursuant to the new section 2B of the 2003 Act can claim an amount of money for work done or services rendered during a period prior to, as well as after, the commencement of the section.  The new section is providing a remedy to a defined class of persons who have not been properly recompensed for work done or services rendered by reason of the illegality of their contracts of employment.  It covers those who never had permits and those whose permits lapsed through no fault of their own.  The employer has benefitted from the work done or services rendered.  If the employee had held an employment permit, the employer would have had to pay him or her at least the national minimum wage.  As a matter of social justice, the Minister wishes to provide a remedy to the class of persons referred to in section 2B.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">  New subsections (6) to (9), inclusive, inserted into section 2B, impose limitations on the right of action conferred by section 2B and are proposed, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, for the purpose of making the section more likely to withstand challenge whether on constitutional or European Convention on Human Rights grounds.  The new subsection (10) inserted into section 2B provides that, where the Minister institutes proceedings under section 2B, the court may award costs in favour of the Minister.  We are considering some further amendments to these provisions and I will revert on this matter on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, are drafting amendments falling out of amendment No. 9, which inserts new subsections (6) to (10), inclusive, into the new section 2B of the 2003 Act and relates to the bringing of an action against an employer.  Amendment No. 13 is a drafting amendment and falls out of the insertion of a new subsection (14) into new section 2B, which is addressed in amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 14 defines terms used in section 2B.  It also provides that proceedings taken against an employer under section 2B may be brought in the District Court for claims of up to €15,000 and in the Circuit Court for claims of up to €75,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">  We consulted the Courts Service regarding amendment No. 15.  It has indicated that, in the cases provided for by this section, the only relevant interim relief would involve applying for an order preventing the employer dissipating or reducing his or her assets that might be required to meet the claim if the plaintiff were successful.  Such relief would already be available by way of injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  If by this amendment the Deputy is proposing that the plaintiff could apply for an advance of money that he or she might get in a settlement or court determination, the Courts Service has indicated that it is unaware of such relief being available where there is a dispute and pointed to the danger that allowing relief as proposed would pre-empt the outcome of the proceedings where the case remained to be determined.  Therefore, on grounds that it is unnecessary or possibly ill advised, I am not accepting the proposed amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">  The shoulder note for section 4 of the Bill as published must be amended to read: "Insertion into Act of 2003 of new sections 2B and 2C".</p>

          <p eId="para_84">The Minister of State referred to the amendments as strengthening the law, particularly for the permit holder and people in exploitative relationships.  While this is welcome, but he also referred to the Younis case.  Mr. Younis was present during our consideration of this Bill, but he still has not received anything for what he went through.  How many work permit exploitation cases have been successfully prosecuted in recent years?  We have strong laws that are about to get stronger, but is there a risk that people are not equipped to pursue their rights under them?  For example, they might not have the resources to go to court.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The bodies representing them do not have the resources. There is no sense in having this legislation in place if those whom it is meant to protect do not have the resources to utilise it, particularly in light of the large employers who will exploit it.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I am sure the Deputy will accept that as the Younis case is <i>sub judice</i> I am limited in terms of what I can say in that regard.  In regard to the Deputy's point generally in terms of the robustness of the provisions when a complaint is made, it is the responsibility of NERA to investigate complaints and to ensure that the system stands up to scrutiny.

          <p eId="para_87">I do not expect the Minister of State to comment on particular cases but to respond only in general to the point.  I have absolute confidence in NERA but despite the fact that there is strong legislation in place in this area, those involved in an exploitative situation such as what we are discussing may not have either the resources or physical ability to utilise this law, particularly against large companies <i>per se</i>.  A person can bring a complaint to NERA but to obtain compensation he or she must go through the court process.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">The Minister can also take a case if there has been a breach of the law.  This is where NERA comes into the equation.  When a complaint is made, there is a robust investigation of potential exploitation with clear outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">  On the compensation issue, the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rates of pay for the job.  We determined this when dealing with Deputy Tóibín's amendments.  This is provided for in law so that there is no ambiguity.  The complex standards of proof arise where a court is determining how much compensation should be paid.  It is necessary to remove that ambiguity.  In terms of the specific case mentioned, the question that arises is whether there is a legal contract of employment.  What we are doing is moving to a situation whereby a person who makes a complaint and has acted reasonably in terms of his or her employment conditions and had a reasonable expectation of having a contract will also be covered by this legislation.  We are putting a belt and braces approach around the existing legislation such that there is a comfort for anybody who finds themselves in an exploitative situation that they can come forward and make a complaint and that there is a corpus of law that does not put a prohibitive cost on them in so doing because there is a statutory body, namely, NERA, that exists to err on their side where exploitation occurs.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I do not accept the Minister of State's point with regard to amendment No. 8, namely, that an amount equal to that paid by regularised employees would somehow negate the court case or lead to it falling.  The legislation as drafted provides for an amount equal to the greater of the two options set out.  All we are proposing is the addition of a third option.  It is not the case that if that option is impossible to identify, there are not other options to enable a decision to be made or that this would lead to the collapse of the whole process.  Surely that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">  The issue of comparable wages is already provided for in legislation.  The JLCs are built on the idea of comparable wages, such that this complexity is already understood and catered for in legislation.  If it were the case that we could not enact legislation owing to complexities, we would have little to do here today.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">It is an illegal scenario.  The distinction that must be made is that this applies where no legal contract exists.  I will try to clarify the matter.  It is not the intention of the civil proceedings to provide compensation based on the market or statutory rate for the job but rather to provide compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract.  The national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  If there are other statutory provisions that apply to certain rates for certain types of jobs, then there is no ambiguity.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">While I agree with the point being made by Deputy Tóibín, what he is suggesting would be exceptionally difficult to prove.  Other than when there is an REA or defined payment for all, it is often the case in a particular type of employment that people might be on different wages.  Proving that a complainant should be on the comparable wage chosen would be very difficult to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I am not saying that in certain cases it would not be difficult to prove, but in others colleagues would confirm, by contract, wage information to be submitted to the court as evidence.  Even if it is difficult to prove, the Government can fall back on sections 1 and 2 which refer to the national minimum wage and the statutory wage.  The case will not fall if proof is unattainable.  It will still lead to an incentive for an employer to go down the road of exploitation if we enact this legislation as it is.  It will still lead to a loss of earnings in the long run for an immigrant compared to the rest of the staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I genuinely take the amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed, but one must consider the legislation in its entirety.  For the first time we are providing clarity for the courts where exploitation takes place and a judgment is made in a case in which there is no contract.  We are bolting to it, for want of a better term, a <i>de minimis</i> compensatory regime which will at least allow a person where there is a finding in his or her favour to receive compensation based on statutory provisions.  In previous court cases there was a lack of clarity.  I respectfully contend the amendment as proposed by Deputy Peadar Tóibín could provide for a case in which proceedings could be delayed or the burden of proof on the person being exploited or who could be potentially exploited could become completely unwieldy, as clarity could not be provided for.  The sections before us provide clarity and there is absolutely no ambiguity about the rate of compensation being provided for where there is no legal contract.  It is on that basis that we are not accepting amendment No. 8.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I move amendment No. 16:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_161">In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_162">" 'civil partnership registration' has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2010;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_163">‘connected’, in relation to the connection between a connected person and a foreign employer, means—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_164">(a) the connected person is a subsidiary of the foreign employer,</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_166">(c) the connected person and the foreign employer are both subsidiaries of a holding company that carries on business in the State or outside the State, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_167">(d) the connected person and the foreign employer have entered into an agreement with another person whereby each of them agree to carry on business or provide services with each other in more than one state and to carry on business or provide services in the manner provided for in the agreement;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfer situations.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's employer is outside the State, that is a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is the Irish entity.   </p>
          <p eId="para_169">  The provisions of the Bill regarding to intra-company transfer employment permits must respect the employer-employee contractual relationship that exists between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference in the Bill to the connected person, that could suggest that it was the employer, have been removed and a number of sections redrafted accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">  Amendment No. 16 defines the term "connected", which refers to the affiliation between a foreign and an Irish company for the purposes of granting an intra-company transfer employment permit.  The intention of the amendment is to tighten up and more clearly define the nature of the connections between the foreign employer and connected person, and consequently the definition of the terms "holding company" at amendment No. 21 and "subsidiary" at amendment No. 23 are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">  Amendment No. 16 also defines "civil partnership registration" in terms of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term is used throughout the Bill in the context of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit.  Amendment No. 21 also defines the terms "health insurance", "health insurer" and "medical treatment" as these terms need to be defined in the context of the revised definition of remuneration at amendment No. 24, which I will address later.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Amendments Nos. 17 and 20 further amend the definitions of connected person and foreign employer and are consequential to amendment No. 16.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential to amendment No. 23.  Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, are drafting amendments and are consequential.  Amendment No. 48 is a consequential technical amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">  Amendment No. 49 provides for sector-specific employment permits.  Amendment No. 50 provides for the duration of an employment permit in respect of an intra-company transfer to be set out on that permit.  Amendment No. 52 specifies the persons to whom copies of an employment permit should issue.  With regard to amendments Nos. 72 and 104, it is critical that the Minister is satisfied that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of board and-or accommodation for the duration of the permit holder's stay in the State.  </p>
          <p eId="para_174">  Amendments Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, are consequential technical amendments.  Amendment No. 103 brings the connected person and relevant person, that is, the person in the State with whom a contractor has entered into a contract of service, into the scope of the revocation provisions of section 16 of the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 107 is a technical amendment and is consequential to amendment No. 106.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">  Amendment No. 108 is consequential to the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.  It provides that the Minister may revoke----- </p>

          <p eId="para_181">Yes.  Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8).</p>
          <p eId="para_182">  Please forgive me but I have omitted a few amendments.  Amendment No. 113 allows the connected person to apply for a review.  Amendment No. 114 is a consequential amendment following on from the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.  Amendment No. 118 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 119.  Amendment No. 156 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 157 which inserts a new subsection (3A).  Amendment No. 158 provides that the connected person who contravenes subsection (3A) is guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">  Amendment No. 159 requires the connected person to surrender the copy of the employment permit where the employment it concerns has been, for any reason, terminated by the foreign employer or the foreign national ceases to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, the connected person.  Also, failure by the connected person or the permit holder to do so is an offence under section 24(2), as amended by section 24(c) of the Bill.  The amendment guards against abuse of the permits system by ensuring that all parties are aware of the employment status of foreign nationals who are permit-required.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">  Amendment No 161 requires the connected person to retain records pertaining to the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's duties or training programme and the employment concerned.  Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8), as amended by section 27 of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I should like to speak to amendment No. 49, if possible.  The Minister of State will be aware if an employee - any employee - has a contract and an ability to work only with one employer.  The nature of that relationship will be quite different than if a worker has the ability to work with a number of different employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">It leaves the door wide open for exploitation. If we had a choice, we would not accept that we had to work for one employer but would choose to go from employer to employer to improve our conditions or even as leverage to guarantee that our rights are maintained. The bondage, which is literally part of this process, in tying the employee to the employer is a negative element. I do not see the logic of preventing an employee from being able to work for a different employer within the same sector because we are basically looking at many of the rights to work on the basis of sectors and needs within those sectors. If the Minister of State had a choice, would he like to be tied to one employer or would he like the option to work with other employers? How does he think his rights would be affected?</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I work for many employers in Cork East and I hope they will keep employing me.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">  In regard to amendment No. 49, providing for sector-specific employment permits would only be possible were the Department to waive all checks on the employer, which the Minister cannot accept.  Currently, all employers of permit holders are on the Department's database which is regularly checked by the National Employment Rights Authority as part of their compliance with the permits legislation.  Part of the evaluation of the employment permit application is to check the bona fides of the employer as well as establishing that there are actual labour shortages for the job to be filled.  Refusals arise where the employer is not deemed to be operating legitimately and where no such labour shortage is demonstrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">  The Minister considers that the Deputy's amendment would make a targeted approach to meeting labour market skills shortages through the permit system impossible.  It would also significantly weaken the ability of the State to control and monitor employers of permit holders.  It is on that basis that we cannot accept the proposed amendments.  However, it must be said that we exercise discretion in humanitarian circumstances and where it is less than 12 months-----</p>

          <p eId="para_192">If we go back to the bondage element, as the Deputy so described it, section 12(1)(e) of the 2006 Act provides that, in respect of the foreign national’s first employment permit, he or she remains with the employer for a minimum period of 12 months and the Minister can refuse an application for a second employment permit made during that period and the foreign national already has an employment permit in force.  It should be noted that this is a “may” provision  -  this allows the Department to consider such an application within the 12 month period where the Department has exception policies that have general effect - for example, humanitarian grounds where the employer has moved to a different location in the country.   Such exceptions to section 12(1)(e), when finalised, will be made publicly available.  However, in such an instance, the foreign national will have to apply for a new permit and will have to adhere to the conditions applying to that permit where applicable - in other words, where there is a labour market needs test.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">It is but it is also important that the human rights of individuals are respected.  We have to give workers, whether they are from Cork, New York or Papua New Guinea, certain human rights and we need to ensure that the nature of the relationship between the worker and the employer is in some way level.  If one forces a worker to be tied to a specific employer, it puts that employer in a position of great power, which can be exploited.  We are not just simply filling an economic need in this legislation.  We are also looking to afford people common decency.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">That is a given.  Regardless of the political party from which we come or our political hue or political persuasion, as citizens, we all subscribe to the notion that the human rights and the employment conditions under which any worker works comply with the law and that he or she enjoys full entitlements inherent in any contract he or she has.  However, that still does not answer the Deputy's question.  The binding arrangement - to use those words - is for the first 12 months only.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_236">(g) by deleting the definition of "registered employment agreement".".</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The Minister's preference is for all employment holders to be employed, salaried and paid under an Irish employment contract.  However, in the case of the intra-company transfer employment permit and contract for services employment permit, he acknowledges that the employment in the State is temporary and so facilitates the permit holder remaining on the foreign payroll.  However, this concession has, in practice, introduced a level of complexity to the evaluation of documentation submitted to support such applications.  This has resulted in considerable engagement with applications leading to delay and in some cases refusal.  </p>
          <p eId="para_238">  Amendment No. 24 provides for the insertion of a new section 1A into the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 25 provides the new definition of remuneration for the purposes of the employment permits Acts and fulfils two important functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">On the one hand, it offers a clear definition of what is meant by remuneration and how it is to be provided for all categories of employment permit. This provides clarity and certainty to employers. On the other hand, it introduces clear rules for those applying for intra-company transfer and contract for services employment permits, covering remuneration, duration of time with foreign employer, requirements to top up to Irish statutory minimum wages as well as €40,000 minimum remuneration threshold, before a permit will be issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 set out the principles applying to the remuneration paid to the holders of intra-company transfer employment permits and contract for services employment permits. Amendment No. 73 makes it imperative that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of the permit holder’s stay in the State. Amendments Nos. 74 and 76 enable the Minister to refuse to grant an intra-company transfer employment permit or contract for services employment permit where he or she is satisfied that the health insurance provided is not similar to that provided by a registered health insurer in the State. Amendment No. 75 is consequential to amendment No. 74, while amendment No. 81 is consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 82 allows the Minister to refuse to grant an employment permit for an intra-company transfer or a contract for services where the conditions relating to remuneration and the provision of information on remuneration set out in the amendments to section 6 of the 2006 Act are not met. Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 are also both consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 102 removes a reference to "other benefits" that can be taken into account so as to make it clear that only accommodation, board and health insurance are reckonable components for computing the remuneration to be paid to a foreign national.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 provide the Minister with revocation grounds if the holder of the intra-company transfer or contract for services permit is not adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of his or her stay in the State. Amendment No. 109 clarifies that the remuneration in question is the salary as set out in the definition of remuneration at new section 1A to be inserted into the Act of 2006 and that the salary must not be less than national minimum wage. Amendment No. 110 inserts a cross-reference to section 12(6)(b) which pertains to the hourly rate specified under an enactment, such as any successor to the employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Amendment No. 111 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 112. The latter amendment provides for the revocation of an employment permit where the required statement of earnings does not comply with the requirements of new section 3D(1)(c) or section 3E(1)(b) to be inserted into the Act of 2006 in respect of intra-company transfer or contract for services employment permits.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Finally, amendment No. 116 provides for information, documents and evidence to be prescribed under section 29 at renewal stage and the provision of such information within a prescribed period. It also requires the provision, at renewal stage, of information on the remuneration paid to the foreign national during the period for which a intra-company transfer or a contract services employment permit was granted. </p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_273">“, civil partner, or the former spouse or civil partner where a separation has occurred during the period of employment in the state”.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The logic of the legislation allows for, in certain situations, a partner to work when he or she comes with the permit holder to this country.  Obviously there is a difficulty in that situation if there is a relationship breakdown in that one of the partners might find himself or herself in a nowhere zone.  The aim of this amendment is to ensure that the civil partner, former spouse or civil partner, in the event of a separation occurring during the period of employment, would be able to gain access to work.  It would be shocking to contemplate that a partner would be living here for a number of years, would possibly have children here but would have to leave a job or indeed, leave the country in the event of a relationship breakdown.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Regarding amendment No. 27, the purpose of providing access to the Irish labour market to the spouses, civil partners and dependants of critical skills employment permit holders and third country researchers under Council Directive 2005/71/EC is to differentiate Ireland by enhancing its attractiveness as a destination for this cohort of highly-skilled migrants when compared with our competitors.  As such, this is a deliberate policy decision.  During drafting of the Bill, the issue of separation and divorce was considered.  The legal advice the Department received was that the Bill cannot cross over into the legislative domain of the Minister for Justice and Equality determining or defining separation or divorce.  Second, the question for the Minister for the purposes of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit is whether there is a subsisting relationship of spouse, partner or dependant, that is, it is for the applicant of such permit to satisfy the Minister that he or she is a spouse, partner or dependant at the time of application or renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">  The status of relationships between the primary permit holder and his or her family members is a matter for the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The situation pertaining to the presence in the State of former partners or spouses of primary permits holders is in the first instance a matter for that Minister.  Establishing the situation of a spouse or civil partner whose relationship with the primary permit holder has come to an end is beyond the remit of the employment permits system.  However, the reactivation employment permit scheme should facilitate such individuals whose circumstances have changed and who have obtained permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to remain in the State in their own right.  On this basis, the majority of cases of separated spouses will be capable of being catered for in the new permits system and as such, I am not accepting the Deputy’s amendment</p>

          <p eId="para_277">I take the Minister of State's point that some of the definitions are outside of the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  However, he is asking us to allow a situation whereby individuals in a healthy relationship come to this State in good faith to take up particular role, deliver on their responsibilities, have a family and put down roots of some sort.  Then, if through no fault of their own, the relationship breaks down, their economic future and that of their children is completely destabilised.  I understand that reactivation is a possibility for some of these individuals but I imagine that the reactivation process also takes into consideration sector-specific needs.  What if the skills-set of the individual does not suit the sectors catered for in the legislation?  Will these individuals still be able to seek reactivation?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">No.  There is no labour market needs test.  The statutory provisions still apply.  To be clear, a labour market needs test is not required for a reactivation employment permit.  For the record, the main criterion to be applied to reactivation is that the remuneration must be the national minimum wage or higher.  This applies to applications for employment permits in respect of all occupations except occupations in a domestic setting.  The prospective employee must possess the relevant qualifications, skills or experience required for the employment.  Applications will only be accepted in respect of employees who previously entered the legal market legally on foot of an employment permit, are holders of a temporary stamp 1 and have a reactivation employment permit letter from the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">During our previous discussion on relief, the Minister of State mentioned that it would be impractical to provide relief to individuals who sought justice.  At the outset I made the point that if it was not accessible and not financially doable for individuals who are being exploited, it will not be used.  Therefore, the exploitation will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">  The Minister rejected the previous amendment which would allow for relief for an individual who proceeded down this road.  This is an alternative.  This amendment would enable a foreign national who has embarked on civil proceedings against an employer to seek work so that he or she would be able to feed the family, pay the rent and provide school books and clothing for his or her young children.  It would ensure that it would be achievable for an individual to use this infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">The conditions pertaining to the issue of a permit under the new section 3A are all mandatory.  This is to deter abuses of the proposed reactivation employment permit.  An application cannot be considered if the foreign national does not meet all of the criteria.  Deputy Tóibín's amendment would result in an additional mandatory provision that very few foreign nationals would be able to meet - that is, only foreign nationals who have entered into civil proceedings, which would significantly narrow the field of potential applicants under this permit type.  The Minister's intention in creating this type of employment permit is to facilitate those foreign nationals who have fallen out of the employment permit system to re-enter employment in line with employment permits legislation.  It is not a back door for illegal economic migrants who have not been, or would not be under current legislation, granted employment permits.  An amendment to facilitate this would run counter to the Government's broad policy on employment permits.  It is on that basis that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">This amendment section 8 will insert a new subsection (i) into section 6 of the 2006 Act to require that information, documents and evidence pertaining to a position that was the subject of a redundancy be submitted upon application.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">To provide greater context, this goes back to previous amendments. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, respectively, define the date of dismissal and dismissal by reason of redundancy, in terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. This is required in the context of provisions in section 22 of the Bill dealing with holders of critical skills employment permits and general employment permits who have been made redundant, as well as provisions in section 7 of the Bill that prohibit an employment permit application being made where the employment concerned was the subject of redundancy in the preceding six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> To provide further clarification on amendment No. 40, it ensures that employment permits are not issued in respect of vacancies that have arisen through or were positions subject to redundancy in the preceding six months. It is designed to prevent the possibility of an employer making existing staff redundant in order to replace them with non-EEA nationals. It is important that the legislation has safeguards against distortions to the labour market. This is one such safeguard.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Amendment No. 45 adds a requirement that information regarding any recent redundancies which may relate to a vacancy for which an application is being made be submitted as part of the employment permit.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">A tangential issue has arisen recently, where, for example, company A would employ a number of staff on a particular wage and then company B would be formed, with roughly the same directors and owners as company A, employing staff at a far lower rate.  Then company A would make its staff redundant.  Through this example, I want to bring to the attention of the Minister of State a system whereby people are effectively using company law to constructively dismiss their staff from one company.  This is legal currently, but I suggest the Minister of State should examine the situation.  I am not sure this is the right place to deal with it.  I imagine it is something that could be used when dealing with non-EEA residents.</p>

This supports Government policy to ensure Irish and EEA nationals currently in the labour market are the first cohort employers should look to.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 60, inclusive, are technical.  Amendment No. 62 is also technical.  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting amendment.  Amendments Nos. 64, 65, 69 and 70 are technical and consequential to amendment No. 62.  Amendments Nos. 66 and 68 are drafting amendments and replace the word “advertise” with the term “publish a notice”.  Amendment No. 67 describes what Ministers can set out in the regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">The conditions whereby an employment permit may be granted or refused are set out in clear detail in the legislation.  Reviews of decisions on the granting of employment permits are provided for in section 13 of the Act of 2006.  That section sets out that a review of a decision to refuse an employment permit shall be carried out by an officer of a grade senior to the grade of the person who made the refusal decision.  The segregation of duties in the employment permits area is applied accordingly.  The clarity imposed by the new provisions, in conjunction with this clear review structure, ensures the application, the refusal and the review process are based on transparent and explicit rules with a basis in law.  In this context, it is the Minister’s view that setting up an independent process would create an unnecessary extra layer of administration with cost implications and no discernible benefits.  On this basis, I do not accept the Deputy’s amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">Mo bhrón, mo bhrón.  The Department has considered the waiving of fees in exceptional circumstances.  However, the Bill is intended to place the issue of employment permits on a clear, statutory basis to a level of detail which precludes consideration on a case-by-case basis of the widely varied circumstances of individual applicants.  This is what would be required were the Deputy's amendment to be accepted.  Furthermore, the grounds on which such a waiver might be applied would necessarily be based on a third-party and possibly unsubstantiated report into the circumstances of the applicant, or an investigation into those circumstances, which would likely cause considerable delay in the issuing of the permit and consequently might jeopardise the employment in prospect.  The levels at which fees are set will be stipulated by regulations and the Minister is committed to carrying out a review of the fees for employment permits later in the year.  More than 40% of applicants currently pay no fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">This deals with cases where employers are not fulfilling their responsibilities.

          <p eId="para_813">The documentation required to be submitted within four weeks of the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy will be set out in regulations.  Such documentation is likely to include a letter from the previous employer stating the permit holder has been made redundant within the past six months and an explanation as to why, the previous employer's certified copy of the permit issued for that permit holder and a copy of the P45 which must be dated within the past six months.  The provision of this documentation establishes the bone fides of the circumstances applying.  Only rarely does the Department come across instances where such documentation has not been forthcoming from previous employers.  In practice, where this does arise, it will request that the documentation be forwarded directly and the matter is resolved in this manner.  The amendment is not necessary.</p>
