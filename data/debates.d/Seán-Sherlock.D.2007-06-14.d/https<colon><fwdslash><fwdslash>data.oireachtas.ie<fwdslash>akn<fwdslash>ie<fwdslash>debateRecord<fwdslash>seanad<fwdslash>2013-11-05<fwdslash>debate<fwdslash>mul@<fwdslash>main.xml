          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Denis O'Donovan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Finance to provide an update on the provision of a flood relief scheme for Skibbereen, County Cork, and the progress made to date, particularly in the light of the flooding in Skibbereen on 24 and 25 October 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Rónán Mullen of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss concerns about the proposed combination of Naas and Newbridge community credit unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Martin Conway of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to identify a way to address the increase in commercial rates levied on sports clubs with a members' bar and to clarify the situation in regard to the valuation process for a sports club with a members' bar operating under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Denis Landy of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to outline a specific timeframe for the introduction of collective bargaining legislation and clarify if mandatory trade union recognition is likely to be included in the legislative framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Thomas Byrne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make special statutory provision for the protection of municipal and town land holdings, held for the benefit of citizens of towns, which it is now proposed to transfer to the ownership of county councils, with particular reference to the so-called "Lands at Loyd", Kells, County Meath.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator John Whelan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for Health, two years after the decision to close both Abbeyleix and Shaen community nursing homes in County Laois, to confirm the HSE's commitment to the community nursing home model as part of its 2014 service plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">An gá go dtabharfadh an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe, míniú ar cén bhunús taighde nó sochtheangeolaíoch atá leis an gcinneadh atá glactha ag an Rialtas maidir le cumas na Gaeilge ó thaobh earcaíochta sa Státseirbhís a athrú agus cén chaoi a dtacaíonn sé seo leis an Straitéis Fiche Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have also received notice from Senator Mary Moran of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">The need for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to address the reason for the lengthy delay in a social worker's response to a father's request for a meeting regarding custodial arrangements for his daughter who is on the at-risk register (details supplied).</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I have also received notice from Senator Pat O'Neill of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to explain why cables for the Grid25 project cannot be placed underground in order to deal with the health concerns of the general public, reduction of property values, reduction of farm production and the effect on tourism. </p>
          <p eId="para_19">I regard the matters raised by Senators Denis O'Donovan, Rónán Mullen, Martin Conway, Denis Landy, Thomas Byrne, John Whelan, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Mary Moran as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Denis O'Donovan, Rónán Mullen, Martin Conway and Denis Landy and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Thomas Byrne, John Whelan, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Mary Moran may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Pat O'Neill, as it involves a repeat of the reply to a similar motion on the Adjournment on 22 October 2013.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the appointment as Ombudsman of Mr. Peter Tyndall, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, motion re the appointment as Information Commission of Mr. Peter Tyndall, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 1; No. 3, motion re report of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications recommending the communication of a reasoned opinion to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 2; No. 4, motion re referral to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the use of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 3; and No. 5, Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 - Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 4, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed six minutes. I hope to conclude the debate at 6 p.m., with the Minister for Social Protection to reply at 5.45 p.m. It was agreed that more than three hours would be sufficient for the debate on Second Stage, but, as I stated previously, I have no intention of guillotining the debate on the Bill on any Stage during the week.</p>

          <from>Senator Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T13:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I welcome the Leader's strong commitment to allowing a full, fruitful and, I hope, constructive debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. This shows that these matters deserve our scrutiny and attention and the fact that the Leader has not imposed a guillotine on this legislation will help the debate. I hope colleagues opposite realise clearly over the next few days what they are voting for if that is their intention. They will vote for cuts to maternity benefit, the household benefits package and payments to jobseekers aged under 25. The House has an opportunity to stand up for itself. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage for Government Senators with some conscience to support some amendments. I look forward to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> While I acknowledge we are dealing with that Bill this week, it would be important for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House as well to discuss the water shortages and the curtailment of water supplies in the greater Dublin region. We all know the effect this has had on householders and, in particular, on businesses and rate payers in Dublin city. This was an unforeseen incident and I welcome the fact that the Minister saw fit to visit the plant in Ballymore Eustace yesterday but why is he sitting on €141 million in capital expenditure, which is to be used for the capital programme? That money could be put to good use in advance of bringing forward a new water tax to improve the water services infrastructure. I would like an opportunity to ask the Minister about this and about what future contingencies will be put in place to improve the State's water network and not just the network in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> It was a shame that neither House sat last week. I listened with great interest and occasional incredulity to the confusion arising from the letters issued by Revenue in respect of the local property tax. I remind Members opposite that the legislation introducing the property tax was guillotined by the Government, with only four hours of debate permitted. What was particularly striking last week was that members of the Labour Party, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, were hysterical, acting like they had nothing to do with the introduction of this charge. Moreover, the impression was given that the Revenue Commissioners were a completely separate arm of the State, which is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I support the call by members of the Labour Party for an extension of the deadline for payment. Nobody should be paying a tax in a year in which it is not levied. The confusion arising out of this issue is immense, with people waiting 35, 40 or even 50 minutes to get through to Revenue helplines.</p>

It is not acceptable that some people should have to pay a tax this year for next year. That debate would give us a chance to ask the Tánaiste and other Ministers whether they had any idea these letters were being issued and to discover why in God's name members of the Labour Party have been jumping up and down in recent days as though they are in opposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Any confusion arising out of the letters sent by the Revenue Commissioners is unfortunate. Clarification is certainly required and the Government has moved swiftly to provide it. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has already met with the head of Revenue. The Oireachtas is moving on the issue, rightly so. Deputy Ciarán Lynch has called representatives of the Revenue Commissioners to a meeting of the finance committee to establish the reason the letters were issued.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">It is currently a severe difficulty for many in the Dublin region and it is true that there has been years of under-investment in water infrastructure, which is what appears to be giving rise to the particular problems we are experiencing at the moment. It is a real concern if we cannot guarantee proper water supplies in the capital city. We need to have a debate on this issue and on water infrastructure, the coming changes with Irish Water and whether we will see an improvement. I know the Government has been seeking to make improvements and undo the damage that has been caused by years and years of neglect, including during the boom time when we should have been investing in the sort of modern infrastructure that is required to bring water to residents of the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I welcome the reports that the Cabinet has agreed today to hold a referendum on marriage equality some time in 2015, and certainly within the lifetime of this Government and arising from the Constitutional Convention recommendation. It is very welcome. I was one of the many legislators who attended the convention this weekend, where a majority voted in favour of a removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. I hope we will see other referenda also taking place on similar recommendations of the convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I thank the Leader for ensuring the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 will not be guillotined. We need to have a very important debate. I have put down three amendments to the Bill and I tried to be constructive. As I have also been in touch with the Minister's office in the past week with several questions, I look forward to the debate in the coming days and will make my decisions based on what we hear on the floor of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I echo the calls for a debate on water supply in the Dublin area, especially with regard to the quality of the water as well as the communications issues involved. Communications issues also apply to the local property tax and medical cards and I wonder whether the State should use organisations such as NALA in communicating to people in plain English exactly what is happening and when it is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> The major issue I would like to raise is about what took place yesterday in the Hague in respect of child exploitation material. We have had some good debates in this House on the issue, and I have issued a report on it as well. I believe Ireland needs to bring in a system of filtering for child exploitation material. I do not believe that will be a panacea, but it has been proven to be a deterrent and that is what we need to do. I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to clarify to the House the steps he will take in transposing the European directive into Ireland. That was one of the recommendations in the directive. We have had a considerable debate in the House, but we should continue to play a role in leading the debate and calling for action on behalf of children in Ireland who are being exploited in order to have images to upload to these horrendous sites.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Thank you very much. I would not have been in the position to join in the slurpfest that greeted the Taoiseach. I would have felt a moral obligation to strike a discordant note because that is what Independents are for. They have to ask the awkward questions. We have won the referendum, but we have a huge job in front of us. That is illustrated for us today because I did not agree with everything in the Quinn-Zappone Bill. I only saw it the day that it was presented, and the same thing happened with Senator John Crown's Bill. I was asked to second the Bill five minutes before the debate began and I was delighted to do so, but I do not agree with everything in these Bills. For example, I do not agree with the gathering rush towards the general overview of European legislation. That cannot be accomplished without a bureaucratic support and perhaps people do not realise there is a huge volume of stuff that comes out.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Today, we are taking a rake of stuff, some of it from the European Commission, without debate. Are we serious, if we are going to allow this very significant amount of material through without debate because that would be too troublesome and cumbersome? These are only two or three instruments. What if there are a couple of hundred? We must look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> I also do not agree with half pay. Half pay is essential in the Army where if one is reduced in rank, one is given half pay. I do not agree, unless somebody produces argument, not sentiment. I know it is very popular, and that some people have said we should work for nothing. That will create a real aristocracy of the elite. It is remarkable that at least two Members of this House came from the unemployment register to play distinguished roles in the House. I doubt that they could have done that if they got nothing. Suggesting we are worth nothing means we might as well have abolished ourselves. Quite a lot must be teased out and we must do it straightaway.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I also do not agree with 50% women; I do not agree with 50% for anything. I want the best. I supported the Electoral (Amendment) Act because it provided that at least 30% of the party candidates should be women, but the people should have the choice. We cannot choose for them. I do not know how it would apply to the university seats if they were to be split up, for example. I suppose I could play both sides against the middle and be regarded as a kind of honorary joker, so I could go in with either side.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> The other issue is the tax. This is a serious matter. The Revenue Commissioners have made a total bags of it. One is presented with options, but they are not equal because if the person selects one, which might be the only possible one for the person, or one of two, the person is penalised. It is a violation of natural justice to ask people to pay for something before the debt is incurred. That is just plain wrong and it should be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> My final point, which I will try to raise as a matter on the Adjournment, is related to this. The Revenue Commissioners decided two years ago in 2011 not to issue receipts. One can get an online, unsigned acknowledgement, but how will that hold up in a court of law? If people wish to sell the house 30 or 40 years later, they cannot do so without the tax receipts but they do not have them. That is a major error. There should be something provided, but I will raise it as a matter on the Adjournment.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">Will the Leader schedule a debate on the Grid25 issue which affects 19 of the 26 counties? It affects people in respect of health issues, farm production, property values and tourism. I am very disappointed that the matter I tabled for debate on the Adjournment this evening was ruled out of order, because it is a repeat of a matter raised on the Adjournment by Senator David Cullinane. However, the Department has been in contact with me and told me that the Senators matter referred to a Waterford issue. I now seek a general debate on this because it is affecting 19 of the 26 counties. This country and the Minister have a chance to set a policy of undergrounding these cables. Since 1992 Belgium has put no cable of 400 kV overground and Holland is putting all such cables underground. Why should we suddenly blight our landscape? This year was a major success for The Gathering and tourism. When people are asked what is the major attraction for them in coming to this country they say it is the scenery. However, now we going to put these pylons overground and blight our countryside.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> We have a chance to change this country's policy with regard to EirGrid. The cost was a major factor, at ten times the cost, but it is now only two and half times as expensive to put the cables underground. A cost-benefit analysis has been done and it shows that this can be clawed back over 40 years because the currents are different. It is an AC current overground but a DC current underground and an AC current overground loses a great deal of its energy. There are health, farming and tourism issues for the general public, so there should be a debate in the House on Grid25 because it is affecting 19 counties. I do not accept the Department's view about what was raised by Senator Cullinane as that dealt with his native County Waterford. The Minister should come to the House to discuss this because it is a national issue. There is a pylon group in every parish in the country at present and we are all being put under pressure. It is possible to invite the Minister to the House to have a full and frank debate on this and to put all the facts on the table. People are confused, because EirGrid is not telling the truth.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I second Senator Darragh O'Brien's proposal to seek priority for the property tax issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I reiterate my deep concern about the property tax and the manner in which the public at large have been treated. I am not sure if Revenue is to blame, if it is a cock-up by the Government or who knew or did not know what. The fact is that 80% of the people who paid their property tax six months ago in 2013 did so by debit card, credit card or by cheque, as acknowledged by Revenue. I had a number of advice clinics over the weekend and most of the people who came to see me were elderly and deeply concerned, and some of them were outraged, about being asked again in the same year to pay another property tax. The letter that issued asks people to select one of the choices offered, choices which are incoherent and difficult for an ordinary person to understand. It is effectively telling 80% of the compliant, honest taxpayers who paid their property tax last year by debit card, credit card, cheque or cash that if they pay the tax by one of the methods offered, they will pay it five months in advance. That is an appalling vista. Either those at top level in Revenue should bow their heads in shame or the Ministers, some of whom have come out and hopped up and down saying this is all wrong, should come out and put this issue to bed on bed once and for all.</p>

This is an awful insult to compliant taxpayers. Most people paid the property tax this year and they are being hit a second time this year before Christmas, which is confusing for people. There is a great deal of confusion and hurt. Coverage of this issue has been widespread in the media over the weekend. It is like trick-or-treat at Hallowe'en; the people are being tricked about what is going on. What happened was premeditated, furtive and extremely nasty against the general public. Members of the public need an apology and somebody should make it sooner rather than later. This is festering sore that will get worse over the next few weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">This service is to be paid for by AIB and provided by the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation. I have said on many occasions in this House that it is inappropriate for banks to be acting as the sole judge and jury over their own borrowers. The fact of the matter, and we all know this from engaging with borrowers directly ourselves, is that many borrowers are intimidated in dealing with their lending institution and it certainly is not an equal relationship. Many borrowers do not feel that they are on an equal footing in dealing with their lending institutions. I hope this service will be effective and that it will be properly resourced by AIB and will lead to more sustainable mortgage solutions. However, the fact remains that many borrowers who are not with AIB or the EBS need such a service. They need an expert to stand between them and the lending institution. I have proposed on a number of occasions in this House that an expert arm of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which is an excellent service but unfortunately very under-resourced in dealing with the current crisis, should be established to operate on a regional basis that would be available for all borrowers, irrespective of the lending institution with which they are dealing.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I welcome Senator David Norris back to the House after a couple of weeks away. He is back with the same vigour, energy and enthusiasm. I talked to some people who heard him speaking in the Hugh Lane Gallery last night. They said the same thing about his vigour and enthusiasm. I am glad to have him here.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I also welcome the word that was received the other day regarding adoptions from Russia, a topic that has been raised by Senator Mary White and me in this House. There was a real problem with such adoptions. There is probably still something of a problem. I gather that the Attorney General is now working on it. While the 31 October deadline might not have been removed, I gather that new legislation can be made retrospective. This appears to hold out hope for potential adoptive parents of Russian children. There was a huge problem in this regard. The prospective adoptive parents did not hear until 30 October that it was possible for this to be made retrospective. Why did they have to wait until the very last moment? If we had known this a month or two ago, all of the challenges and problems in this area would have been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I think we should find time on some occasion to debate a €175 million scheme that was launched by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, in May this year. The scheme in question was aimed at those starting up entrepreneurial companies, particularly in the technology sector. It seemed like a great scheme when it was launched in May. All of us welcomed it at the time. We are now in November, and not one penny from that fund has been accepted at this stage. It seems to me that start-up companies which have the potential to create jobs need money to get up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">It was announced in May and launched at the end of May. Even at this late stage in November, none has been accepted. I do not understand how we can allocate such a sum of money and then not do something about it. Perhaps it will happen but why does it take so long to get things done in this country? </p>

Those of us who have played in the Aviva Stadium - Senators Gilroy and Moran and I - know how it feels to win a match there. Other Members of the House were there also. We hammered the journalists who I hope are listening in. I welcome the appointment of Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane as manager and assistant manager. Press conferences might be more exciting than the matches themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I join other Senators in calling for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the water situation. Dublin's problem this week could be Donegal's problem next week and all counties are concerned about the future water situation with Irish Water coming on board. It is an urgent debate that needs to take place. </p>
          <p eId="para_124"> "The Disappeared", which was shown on television last night, is a stark reminder of where we are. I am not alluding to Senator Cullinane because he is an intelligent Senator. Last night was the first time that people could put families to names. Names were read out over the years, which meant nothing to most people. When people saw the mothers, sisters and grandchildren of these people, such as the mother who held the shoes of her son who she says was put into a shallow grave, they had to face up to the reality. It is very useful for Senators to listen to BBC Radio Ulster. When I listened to the Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster as I drove through Northern Ireland this morning, the only thing that was missing today was Sinn Féin which had disappeared from the airwaves. That is typical of what happened last night. Somebody said this morning on the BBC that the programme by Darragh McIntyre should be shown in every school throughout the country because it is probably the most petrifying and upsetting programme I have seen in the many years.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I second the call made by Senator Pat O'Neill for a debate on the Grid Link project that affects the south east, west, midlands and north east with the North-South interconnector. We need a constructive debate. The Adjournment debate on the matter, which was taken by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, was anything but productive. He was very party-political and defensive and did not deal with the issues at all. I have attended public meetings along the length of the route from Waterford to other locations. I attended a meeting last night in Stoneyford in County Kilkenny attended by around 600 people. Meetings are taking place in Meath and other counties tonight. There is cross-party support in opposition to these monstrosities - pylons 43 m high with 15 sq. m. bases running along 1 km wide routes where no development can take place and where development is sterilised along the entire route.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The Leader knows that in the south east where there is high unemployment, tourism and agriculture, including food production, are two areas that are seen as critical for the economic development of the region. EirGrid plans to put these pylons through the heart of County Waterford, into County Kilkenny and potentially up into counties Kildare, Wicklow or Laois depending on the preferred route. There is very clear opposition to that and growing support for the underground option. EirGrid seems to be setting its face against any alternative and opting for the cheapest option rather than the best and most environmentally sustainable option, which is underground. New technologies are emerging all the time in this area. The reason I am looking for a debate is because we can have a constructive debate with the Minister about those alternative options because that is what we are elected to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The meetings we are attending involve people in communities who have real concerns. It is our job to bring these concerns directly to the Minister and I ask the Leader to arrange that debate at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I concur with Senators Pat O'Neill and David Cullinane and my colleague from Roscommon, Senator John Kelly, who has been raising this issue until he is blue in the face. A grand deception has been visited on the people and EirGrid has sucked Government policy with it on the basis of its assertion that we need to double the capacity of the grid. It wants to erect a further 800 km of high voltage power cables throughout the country. I have just come from a hearing by An Bord Pleanála in County Laois, where the company is trying to erect 17 new lines in the scenic area of Ratheniska, with which people will be familiar from the ploughing championships. It says the lines are intended to support energy supplies to Kilkenny and Carlow, despite the fact that another 400 kV line is being laid from Cork to Kilkenny. The purpose of the lines and the substation is to facilitate wind farm developers. We need an urgent debate on and review of the policy because the emperor has no clothes. EirGrid is the emperor and it has gone rogue. It must be brought to heel and held to account.</p>

We have three CEOs, three Ministers and three State agencies with responsibility for water. We need to put one person in charge and build the Garryhinch reservoir.

          <p eId="para_133">Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House for a debate on funding for professional sports in this country? Senator Jimmy Harte kindly mentioned Sligo Rovers' win in the cup. Anybody who attended the match or watched it on television would agree that the players from Drogheda and Sligo gave a fantastic spectacle which would give pride to any manager or fan throughout the world. It is worth noting that in winning that game, Sligo Rovers will receive a mere €50,000 and Drogheda will receive €30,000. Approximately €170,000 was taken at the gate. The winning players from Sligo Rovers will be on the dole today because they are only on 40 week contracts. The esteem in which our national league is held, even by our national association, is not that high when one considers that the medals given to the winning players spelled Sligo as "Silgo". These players, who gave so much over the season, are now on the dole with misspelled medals, against a backdrop where €2 million is being made available for a new management team for our national sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I support the calls by Senators John Whelan, Pat O'Neill and David Cullinane for a broad debate on the Grid25 project. I have raised the issue on numerous occasions. Does the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and EirGrid have a sense of the feelings among people who are opposed to these pylons being erected within 50 m of their homes?</p>
          <p eId="para_137">People across the country are ready to rebel on the issue. I know that people are prepared to go to prison and resist these unless EirGrid consider underground cabling. If that is the legacy that EirGrid wants to leave, it will be a shocking indictment of the company. </p>
          <p eId="para_138"> EirGrid's defence mechanism is that underground cabling costs two and a half times more than going overground. If it goes underground, however, it will not have to compensate farmers. Farmers are happy if the cabling is out of sight and out of mind, and they will not seek compensation. I doubt very much if EirGrid has told people that this should be built into the figure it is trying to convince people it will cost. </p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The main issue I want to raise is that of discretionary medical cards. The matter has been widely discussed in the media and the Oireachtas, yet medical cards are still being withdrawn. At the weekend, I had a call from the distraught father of a young child in Crumlin Hospital. The PCRS or primary care reimbursement service was refusing to give the child a medical card. For the past week, the child has been ready to be discharged from hospital but Crumlin will not discharge her until she has a medical card. She has had six months of treatment at a cost of €1,200 per month.</p>

Mr. Foley was a Member of the Oireachtas for 21 years, including a term in this House. Mr. Daven was a former Deputy, Minister and MEP. I extend my sympathy to their families. Denis Foley was a very good friend of mine and we were colleagues on Kerry County Council for many years. He was an outstanding public representative who did great work for people. He was popular on all sides of the political divide, as was evidenced by the huge turnout at his removal, funeral mass and burial in Tralee last week. Suitable arrangements will be made for tributes to be paid to him in both Houses in due course. In the meantime, however, I want to extend my personal sympathy to his wife Anna, his son Billy, his daughters Councillor Norma, Margaret and Denise. Ar Dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> As regards the property tax, from my training in business I have always believed in paying a bill as soon as I got it, otherwise one is forever paying it. I went online to pay my property tax and as I clicked off on the credit card I said to myself that was a very short year. I think I am computer literate but I did not see the catch when signing off on it. Many people like me did the right thing, although I am not seeking any credit for that. It is a huge disincentive for me to start paying bills promptly in future, which is bad for the country. People who did pay online should get some form of tax credit against their tax liability for the coming year.</p>

          <p eId="para_151"> People with disabilities are among the most vulnerable in society. This scheme, however, will protect and safeguard them in a residential setting while also holding service providers to a set standard.</p>

The people named in the programme should answer the questions. Allegations have been made about an Oireachtas Member and the Minister for Justice and Equality should call on him to make a statement on the matter. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I have previously met the families of some of those who disappeared.

          <p eId="para_158">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to the House to explain Government policy in the spatial context. This request comes in response to ongoing announcements of job creation, which is taking place almost exclusively in Dublin. To emphasise the point, recent statistics indicate that IDA Ireland organised in excess of 250 visits to sites in the Dublin region in the past 12 months, whereas in Leitrim, Sligo and many other counties in the north west and elsewhere, there was no more than one IDA Ireland visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> We all welcome job creation. I am very much aware that multinational companies tend to decide where they wish to locate. I have no wish to reflect adversely on the work of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in bringing jobs in a global sense to the country. However, unquestionably the country is developing into a two-tier economy, which is a cause of great concern. It is time for the Government to decide what it wants to do about the rest of the country outside Dublin, with Cork, Limerick and to a lesser extent Galway getting the odd titbit from the table as these announcements are made. I do not single out Waterford because that is where the Leader comes from. The number of visits is small as is the number of jobs created there, with the exception of Eishtec, an indigenous company and not a multinational, which recently announced the creation of 250 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> The Government is giving no priority to trying to encourage companies to locate in Sligo and the midlands, particularly high-tech companies. The nature of high-tech companies is that they do not need to locate in Dublin, but increasingly that is where they are going, to the detriment of the economy in the rest of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I support Senator Paschal Mooney's request for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the House to have a general discussion about the employment situation and in particular the lack of regional balance in recent job announcements. Having said that, we all welcome that figures published in recent days indicate that for the first time since 2009, the jobless figure has fallen below 400,000. We now have 1.867 million people at work, an increase of nearly 34,000 in the past year. The unemployment rate has dropped from 15.1% to 13.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">We have had more start-ups and fewer insolvencies in the past year. Start-ups are up by 17% and failures are down by 32%. Manufacturing has hit a two-year high and consumer sentiment has risen to a six-year high.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> It is welcome that in the past 24 hours the Minister has announced €125 million under the first development capital fund which will focus on investing in small and medium-sized enterprises, but I share the concerns expressed by Senator Feargal Quinn in that the €125 million announced earlier this year or last year has not been accessed by or is difficult to access for companies. While €2 billion is being set aside in a suite of measures for investment and job creation in companies of all sizes in the coming years, we need to have a discussion on how successful companies are in accessing that money. We need to have a general discussion with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on an Action Plan for Jobs, its updating and how we can accelerate the level of job creation. What Senator :Paschal Mooney said is quite accurate in that we are beginning to have a two-tier economy whereby many of the jobs are being created in Dublin, Cork and Galway city, while in towns such as my town of Ballinasloe, where we have lost 1,000 industrial jobs during the past decade, we are seeing very little to replace those jobs.</p>

As I have said numerous times, we have a very unbalanced four-man committee running the country. I would like to ask the Minister to account for herself. One week before the budget the expert group on the future of child care strategy recommended that maternity benefit should be extended from six to 12 months. The Minister said she would do all in her power to get this implemented. However, she has presided over cuts to maternity benefits to Irish women. Did Irish women cause this economic crisis?</p>

This means that the Government has reduced the collective maternity benefit payment by €830 over the six-month period of maternity leave. How can Senators support that? How can my colleagues on the Government side support this?</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I would like to ask it, a Chathaoirleach, if you will allow me. Irish men work. Irish women bear children, come back to work and look after children. They have a much more demanding role than the men of this country. That is why I am on my feet to defend Irish women.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">I add my voice of congratulations to Sligo Rovers, which won the FAI Cup final last Sunday, and commiserate with Drogheda United. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that another cup final took place on the same day at the same location, the women's FAI Cup final between Raheny United, which won after a thrilling encounter, and Castlebar Celtic. I congratulate Raheny and commiserate with Castlebar Celtic which put up a really good performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> While I am talking about women's football, I draw attention again to the fact that women's football in Ireland has a new league structure which has been in place for the past three years. There are eight teams involved, four from Dublin, one from Wexford, one each from Castlebar and Galway and one from Cork. Perhaps Members might see whether they could do a little more to support their local clubs and perhaps the league in general and I encourage them to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Has a report been laid before the House because if so, it has not come to my attention? Failing that, a member of the joint committee from the Seanad should report to Members on its deliberations because it is not appropriate to put anything through this House without debate. Again, some of the Seanad's dearly-held powers in respect of the European Union, which were enunciated during the referendum campaign, in which the Seanad has equal say with the Dáil, are being exercised today. However, this measure also is being taken without debate, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> With regard to the issue of overhead pylons, I have been encouraging everyone in County Meath to attend the meeting being held at Trim tonight. I expect and hope to be there, provided that proceedings here are concluded on time and depending on how long debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill continues. If I am not at the meeting in Trim, I will be in this Chamber. However, this is an issue for the Government. While the support of the Labour Party Senators in the campaign to place underground these cables is welcome, the Government has issued a policy statement on transmission in which it endorses fully the strategy of EirGrid. That was a Cabinet decision, which I believe was published some time in 2012 and is available on the website of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. Consequently, EirGrid is proceeding with the explicit approval and endorsement of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The single point in the Government statement that in some respects is welcome is a paragraph referring to gaining community acceptance. However, EirGrid has failed completely to gain any level of community acceptance or even community engagement. Nothing has happened and the community has refused to engage with EirGrid. Moreover, I believe those concerned are correct because of the heavy-handed manner in which this has happened. This has resulted in huge wastage of resources in County Meath because one should not forget this project started in that county in October 2007 but has not yet reverted to An Bord Pleanála. These things have a habit of dragging out for years. It has been five or six years since I attended a similar meeting in Trim, at which approximately 3,000 people attended. I would not be surprised were the attendance tonight similar or perhaps larger, because the attendees then all came from counties Meath and Cavan, whereas I understand people will be coming from all over the country this evening. It is important that the North-East Pylon Pressure Campaign, NEPPC, be supported in its meeting today and that a message be sent to the Government that it must change the marching orders it has given to EirGrid on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">---- they have questions to ask of their computer developer because it should have been possible to tick the box and outline how one intended to pay. The reason the letters were sent was to ascertain how people intended to pay and not when they intended to pay. The computer developer obviously linked the box on the credit cards to automatically deduct the amount. This should not have been done and there are questions to be answered as to the reason it was developed in such a fashion. It was never intended that it should be so and I seek an answer to this question from whosoever developed the system. Systems do not develop themselves and I seek a full answer to the question. Everyone who has a bank card and a credit card has a bank account and consequently, one is not obliged to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> As spokesperson on the environment in the Seanad, I could not let this day pass without commenting on the water issue. I read a comment made by the former Dublin city engineer, the late Jim Fenwick, in 1997 or 16 years ago, that the water supply in Dublin was on a knife edge. Clearly this remains the case but I wish to go forward without being critical. One must learn lessons from everything that happens and I wish to find out what is being done in respect of rainwater harvesting. I seek a debate in this Chamber to ascertain how a comprehensive policy on rainwater harvesting can be developed. All the expensively-treated water is used for flushing toilets and everything else and only 1% of the treated water is used for human consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">We could reduce the use of treated water by up to 70% by water harvesting. If we could introduce a system to give tax relief to those who would purchase rainwater harvesting systems, it would save money. That would automatically reduce the amount of water that is being used. We would have up to 70% extra in our tanks. I ask the Leader to allow a debate on this issue as a matter of urgency. It should have been included in the building regulations, but it was not. It is included in the city and county development plans.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I wish to comment on the proposed Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, as did Senator Thomas Byrne. The proposed Ombudsman acquitted himself very well and was recommended for appointment by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I know we have problems to resolve in respect of property tax and water issues. These are important issues, but I am deeply concerned about an unfair anomaly that has been brought to my attention in respect of the income ceiling for medical cards. A couple, whether married or in a civil partnership, are disadvantaged over a single person. The income ceiling for a married couple is €900 whereas it is €500 for a single person. In previous years, the ceiling for a married couple was double that of a single person. In 2012, the ceiling was €1,400 for a couple and €700 for a single person. Last year it was set at €1,200 for a couple and €600 for a single person. A couple with an income of €909 are just €9 over the limit, whereas a brother and sister living in the same house have an income ceiling of €1,000. There is a fundamental difference in how the HSE is looking at the criteria for a couple <i>vis-à-vis </i>a single person. I spoke to the Minister's adviser this morning, who defended this decision. I do not think it is fair. People have made the case that one cannot share medical treatment, or medication. It is not like sharing electricity or food. There is a difference. Will the Leader find out the reason for the discrepancy and why a couple is disadvantaged under the new criteria? Will he return to this House to tell us when it will be reversed? I do not think it is correct to discriminate against a couple, be they married or in a civil partnership as opposed to two single people living together.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I will not delay the House, but I too raise the question of the property tax. The message that should come out from this House is that people who have paid their 2013 property tax should not under any circumstances contemplate paying their property tax for 2014 until January or February next year. It is as simple as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I congratulate those who sent such letters. Nobody could understand it. I would like Members to support the message that anybody who has paid his or her 2013 property tax does not pay his or her 2014 tax until next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Senator Darragh O'Brien and others raised the issue of water shortages in Dublin. The water shortages were caused by unforeseen circumstances and continue to be an inconvenience for householders and businesses. Senator John Whelan, speaking on the same issue, was one of a number of Senators who called for a debate on water infrastructure. The development of the Garryhinch reservoir was also mentioned. We will endeavour to have a debate on the issue of water infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Senator Cáit Keane mentioned rainwater harvesting. I will try to get the Minister to come to the House for a debate on the question of water provision. We debated the Irish Water legislation, but I hope we can have a more detailed debate in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Senator Darragh O'Brien and several other Senators raised the issue of property tax. I understand the Revenue Commissioners will clarify the position in the newspapers and on the airwaves. Yesterday the Minister for Finance clarified that nobody needed to pay property tax before 2014. </p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Senator Ivana Bacik referred to the proposed referendum on marriage equality. I have not heard the outcome of the Cabinet's deliberations on the matter, but I am sure it will be welcomed when the Cabinet decides on it. There have been a number of recommendations from the Constitutional Convention. The Government and the Parliament will decide whether we will have referendums on these issues and I am sure this will be a matter for discussion in the House in the coming months. </p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Senator Jillian van Turnhout raised the issue of child exploitation and abuse, especially in the context of the case outlined yesterday. As she mentioned, we had a very comprehensive debate on the EU directive. I will check the progress of legislation on that matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> We welcome our colleague, Senator David Norris, back to the House. He mentioned the issues of Seanad reform and property tax, which I have addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Senators Pat O'Neill, David Cullinane, John Whelan, John Kelly and Thomas Byrne, among other Senators, referred to the EirGrid proposals. It is a matter of concern to citizens in many counties who will be affected by the pylons. Many are bringing questions of health, farming and tourism to the attention of all Oireachtas Members. There was an Adjournment debate on the issue with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, a couple of weeks ago, but I will ask him to come to the House to debate it. However, it is entirely a matter for him to decide whether he wishes to come to the House having been here only a fortnight ago for the Adjournment debate. Senator David Cullinane has attended quite a number of meetings in Waterford and County Kilkenny, where he lives. I note his points in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Senator Denis O'Donovan referred ti the need for plain English in correspondence emanating from the Revenue Commissioners and all Departments. I could not agree more with him on that matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Senator Aideen Hayden welcomed the setting up of a service for people in mortgage distress with AIB and called for an expert arm of the MABS to deal with all lenders. We will raise that issue with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, as I am sure will the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I say to Senator Katherine Zappone that I am not aware of the Cabinet decision on the referendum on marriage equality, but I am sure the matter will be addressed in the coming days. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Senator Paul Coghlan referred to the independence of the Revenue Commissioners and the prudence of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, in managing capital funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Senator Feargal Quinn raised the issue of Russian adoptions. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has sought advice from the Attorney General and it is possible that retrospective legislation can be brought forward to address the matter, on which I was contacted by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We would all welcome a resolution to deal with the situation in which some families find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Senator Feargal Quinn also referred to the €175 million allocated for start-up companies and mentioned how little progress there had been in the take-up of this funding. Senators have called for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to be invited to the House to address the question of job creation. I hope I will be able to get him to attend in the coming weeks. However, legislation dealing with SMEs will be taken in the House in the next few weeks, which will give Members an opportunity to raise matters with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Senators Jimmy Harte and Mary Moran referred to the RTE programme "The Disappeared", which was broadcast last evening. It was an excellent production and our hearts go out to the relatives of those who disappeared. There are many questions to be asked of many people in this regard. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the families who have had to put up with this dreadful situation for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Senator John Whelan raised the matter of water infrastructure and the Garryhinch reservoir. I have addressed this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Senator Marc MacSharry referred to the funding for professional sport. He mentioned soccer, in particular, and his emphasis was on the FAI. I share his concerns that players are hired on 40 week contracts and must go on the dole for the rest of the year, but I understand the funding for the new international team manager and his assistant will primarily be private rather than Government funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Senator John Kelly raised the issue of discretionary medical cards. He should table the issue he raised as an Adjournment matter to receive an exact response from the Minister for Health, but I share his concerns about the withdrawal of medical cards where they should not be withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the deaths of Denis Foley and Noel Davern. We would all like to convey our deepest sympathy to their families. I note the Senator's comments on a tax credit for people who have paid property tax, but I doubt that much attention would be given to it. It would probably not be acted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Senator Mary Moran also welcomed the announcement that HIQA would conduct independent inspections of residential homes and services for people with disabilities. Everyone involved will welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Senator Paschal Mooney called on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to come to the House to address the issue of job creation and the need for greater balance in creating jobs in the regions. I agree that the vast majority of job announcements have been in Dublin, Dundalk, Cork, Galway and Limerick to a lesser degree and that there is a need for greater emphasis on the regions, but, as Senator Michael Mullins pointed out, there are 34,000 more people at work now compared to this time last year, which is positive. There are other positive aspects to employment issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I agree, however, that the question of a regional balance where job creation is concerned should be addressed and debated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Senator Mary White referred to cuts in maternity benefit. We will have ample time to discuss that issue during the debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. Three hours have been allocated for the debate on Second Stage and as much time as is needed will be allocated on Committee Stage tomorrow. I am sure the Senator will raise the points she has made today with the Minister when we come to discuss the relevant sections of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> We all join Senator John Gilroy in emphasising the importance of supporting women in sport, particularly women's soccer teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Senator Thomas Byrne referred to the appointment of the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner. As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames observed, the appointment was discussed by the relevant joint committee, the deliberations of which are available for examination by all Members. I note Senator Thomas Byrne's points on EirGrid.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Senator Cáit Keane spoke about water infrastructure. She pointed out that the infrastructural deficiencies in Dublin had been highlighted as a serious problem in 1997 but that little had happened in the intervening years. I hope we will see progress on the matter in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Senator Fidelma Healy Eames referred to anomalies in the provision of medical cards, whereby the income threshold for a couple aged over 70 years was €900, while the threshold for a single person was €500. The Senator might table an Adjournment motion on that issue which would allow her to discuss it with the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I note Senator Terry Brennan's advice on the issue of the property tax payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">-----because the number of people out of work remains far too high, but it confirms that the Government has taken the right measures since coming into office and inheriting an unprecedented crisis. The labour market is improving because of the policies we have pursued, which is why the economy is healing slowly but surely. We are exiting the bailout programme and can look forward to regaining control of our destiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> The live register figures are a clear sign that things are moving in the right direction. The latest CSO data showed there were 396,512 people on the register in October, 23,000 fewer than the same month last year and almost 34,000 fewer than in October 2011. This is a very welcome turnaround considering that the register was firmly on an upward trajectory towards 500,000 when the Government took office, to an unemployment rate of 15% or over. The unemployment rate for October has come down to 13.2%. The live register has fallen below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The turnaround is the chief reason I was able to lower the spending reductions required of my Department for 2014. When negotiations on the budget began, the Department was initially expected to make new spending reductions of €440 million. This was ultimately reduced to €226 million plus an additional €30 million in savings will be made through more fraud and control measures in 2014, while €34 million will be saved through better management of expenditure and lower than expected demand on some schemes, bringing the Department's cumulative adjustment to €290 million. Even with this lower adjustment, the Department continues to play its role in the necessary deficit reduction programme as Ireland prepares to exit the bailout.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> Overall, social welfare expenditure will fall below €20 billion in 2014, despite demographic pressures owing to the growing number of older people, and welfare expenditure will continue on a downward trajectory as we help more people back to work through the Pathways to Work strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">That is the context in which I bring this Bill forward to the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> I mentioned the population pressures on the Department's budget. These pressures mean that, for example, the Department had to provide an extra €190 million this year for expenditure on State pensions and on widow and widower contributory pensions. Nonetheless, I have protected pensions in the budget. I have also protected carer's allowance, disability allowance and the other core weekly payments on which people depend. I am also protecting crucial supplementary supports for pensioners, carers and people with disabilities such as the fuel allowance, the electricity and gas allowance, free travel, which is particularly important for retired people, the half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant. Child benefit has also been protected in this budget and will remain a vital universal support for all families and all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> In addition to supporting people when they are out of work, we support them to stay in work. Critics of the welfare system often miss this crucial point. Last year, the Department spent €224 million on the family income supplement, which is a weekly tax-free top-up payment for workers on low pay with children. Next year, we will spend more than €280 million on that payment. More than 40,000 working families, with a total of more than 90,000 children, benefit from the scheme. The family income supplement makes a crucial difference for them by making work more attractive than welfare and in the process helping to build a better future for their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The reality is that helping people back to work and to stay in work is the most effective way of reducing overall social welfare expenditure. Every time we help 10,000 people to come off the live register, we save approximately €95 million in annual welfare expenditure. That is why, since coming into office, I have focused on transforming the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to an active, engaged and focused organisation that provides employment services for jobseekers and employers alike. Our core aim is to engage with every unemployed person to make sure their first day out of a job and relying on a social welfare income is also their first step on the pathway back to work. That work is paying off. The live register figures are proof of this. Data show that the number of people in work increased by 33,800 in the last year and that the private sector is creating 3,000 new jobs every month. It is in that context that I am bringing forward changes to jobseeker's allowance for younger people. Most EU member states require a young person to have made social insurance contributions before he or she can qualify for unemployment benefits or allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Ireland is one of a small number of member states that pay young people a non-insurance-based payment - in our case, jobseeker's allowance - in addition to an insurance-based payment. I am ensuring this continues because of the difficult economic climate and the recognition that not everybody can walk into a job at 18 years of age. However, it is true that paying a significant amount of welfare support on turning 18 years is not the best way of helping young jobseekers into work. To be honest, I do not think any Member of this House would want his or her child to go to the jobseeker's office at the age of 18 years to claim a social welfare payment, rather than getting into work or training or being involved in education or work experience. Work, training and education supports are much more beneficial to young jobseekers in the long term. I am making changes to jobseeker's allowance for young people to ensure a greater emphasis on work, training and education supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">That is a critical move in terms of the traditional approach to social welfare for younger people in Ireland. This will ensure younger people are always better off in education, employment or training than claiming. Even then, it is worth noting that the amounts paid to young jobseekers in Ireland will still exceed those in several member states, including the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom jobseekers aged 24 years or younger get £56.80, or €67, per week. </p>
          <p eId="para_303"> To facilitate the shift towards employment supports, the Department will enhance the range of opportunities currently on offer in the form of internships, participation on employment schemes, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment. The full range of youth employment initiatives will be set out in our plan for the implementation of the EU youth guarantee, which will be finalised and submitted to the European Union by the end of the year. I want to tell Members here, many of whom are actively involved in employment or familiar with many employers, that on 1 January, young jobseekers aged under 26 will qualify for JobsPlus if they are without employment for more than six months. That means their employer will get a monthly cash back subsidy of €300 for every month they work up to two years. The monthly cash-back subsidy for employing jobseekers aged under 26 years who are out of work for more than two years is €400 per month and will be paid to the employer for each month the jobseeker works. It will be paid a month in arrears through electronic funds transfer. I have not been able to make it any easier than that. It is a very simple wage subsidy scheme for employers who take on jobseekers, particularly young jobseekers. Even before any EU funding is agreed, the Department is already committed to spending €1.08 billion next year on work, training and education places and related supports for jobseekers generally. This is an increase of almost €85 million on the projected spend this year. To recap, we will spend an extra €50 million next year on family income supplement for families in work with children on low incomes and an extra €85 million on supports for jobseekers in terms of training and education. In a time of tight budgets, that is a very significant commitment by the Department to helping people back to work. </p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I will now go through the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the Title. Section 2 provides for the definitions. Section 3 provides for the second element of the Budget 2013 decision to broaden the base on which PRSI contributions are charged so as to provide that the exemption from PRSI that applies to employed contributors and occupational pensioners under 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income will be abolished with effect from 1 January 2014. The additional unearned income will now become liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person for Revenue purposes. This relates to a person whose unearned income is in excess of €3,174. This will not apply to PAYE taxpayers with no other income or additional income less than €3,174. In addition, people who have reached State pension age of 66 are not liable to pay PRSI and, therefore, will not be affected. Sections 4 and 7 increase the number of waiting days for entitlement to illness benefit and injury benefit, respectively, from three to six days with the change taking effect from 6 January 2014. Section 5 provides for the alignment of the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit to a standard rate of €230 per week. The change only applies to new claimants and comes into effect from 6 January 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The 26-week duration of the payment is preserved under this budget because we know how important this time is for families and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">This level is substantially in excess of the 14 weeks required under EU legislation. For example, in the Netherlands and France only 16 weeks of maternity benefit is paid. Section 6 provides for the alignment of the minimum and maximum rates of adoptive benefit to a standard rate of €230 per week on the same basis as section 5. </p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Section 8 provides for the discontinuation of the payment of a bereavement grant in the case of deaths occurring on or after 1 January 2014. However, it is important to note that the additional supports which remain available for people following a bereavement are worth considerably more than the bereavement grant. These include widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension, which is a weekly payment based on contributions or a means test; the widowed or surviving civil partner grant, which is a once off payment of €6,000 where there is a dependent child aged 18 years or under, or up to 22 years where the child is in education; a number of social welfare payments, including State pensions, which continue in payment for six weeks following a death and deliver an income of €1,380 to the surviving spouse, partner or estate; and, if a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, a special funeral grant of €850. We also pay significant amounts of money through special needs payments to those who require assistance with funerals.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Section 9 provides for the amendment of the rates of jobseeker's allowance payable to certain claimants aged under 26 years. A reduced weekly rate of €100 currently applies to recipients aged between 18 and 21 years and a reduced rate of €144 applies to those aged between 22 and 24 years, in both cases where the claimant does not have children. This section provides that the reduced weekly rate of €100 will continue to apply to existing claimants aged between 18 and 21 years until they reach 25 years and will also apply to new claimants aged between 22 and 24 years. Section 9 also provides that the reduced weekly rate of €144 will continue to apply to existing claimants aged between 22 and 24 years when they reach 25 years and will apply to new claimants who are aged 25 years. In addition, these lower rates of jobseeker's allowance will apply to claimants aged 25 and under who have exhausted their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit. Claimants who have children will be unaffected by these measures. These changes will apply from 15 January 2014. Section 10 provides for amendment of the rates of supplementary welfare allowance payable to people who are younger than 26 years old on the same basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Section 11 provides for the discontinuation of the mortgage interest supplement scheme for new applicants with effect from 1 January 2014 and allows for a winding down of the scheme for existing claimants over a four year period. In the last couple of years we have paid more than €300 million to banks in respect of mortgage interest supplement with no net gain for the people whose mortgage interest supplement we have been paying. Now that the Insolvency Service and MARP structures are in place, they will be provided for through the MARP process, as was recommended in the reports by various working groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Section 12 provides for the discontinuation of the higher personal weekly rate of invalidity pensions of €230.30 and €206.30 where the qualified adult attains 66 years of age on or after 2 January 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Section 13 provides that where a specified illness or disability payment is paid by the Department to a person who is unable to work as a result of an accident, injury or disease and such social welfare recipient has been compensated by way of court settlement or otherwise, the amount of such illness related social welfare payments that have also been paid as a consequence of the personal injury is to be repaid to the Minister by the person liable to pay compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">In most cases the compensator is an insurance company.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> Currently compensators are allowed to reduce the amount of a settlement arising from a motor accident by an amount equivalent to any illness benefit or invalidity pension paid by the Department. In effect, the benefits involved represent a subsidy to the compensators or insurance companies in such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Similarly, in the case of occupational injuries, compensators are allowed to offset injury benefit and disablement pension payments against compensation for loss of earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Part 3 and section 14 provide for amendment to section 38 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 consequential to section 13.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Section 15 provides for the definition of the "Principal Act" to mean the "Pensions Act 1990". Sections 16 and 17 provide for the inclusion of a reference to the surviving civil partner (contributory) pension in section 59B and 59C of the Pensions Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Section 18 inserts a new section 59H into the Pensions Act and provides the trustees of a pension scheme with the power to amend the scheme rules to ensure that the correct occupational pension is paid at age 65 years. This amendment arises from the change in the qualifying age for State pension from 65 years to 66 from January 2014. It is to address situations which may arise in a pension scheme where the rules of the scheme provide for age 65 years rather than normal pensionable age, and the scheme rules cannot be amended to address this. This change is being made to ensure that trustees can act as appropriate to administer their schemes and are not prevented by any conflict between the Pensions Act and the scheme rules from making any necessary arrangements to amend the scheme. It provides for the cessation of a bridging pension which may be payable in the period before the State pension becomes payable and for determining the correct rate of occupational pension payable in the case of an integrated pension. That completes the main provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Protecting people in need in a very difficult economic climate - while reforming the welfare system to ensure it delivers better long-term outcomes for people - is central to the Government's mission. In 2014 my Department will continue to help more people back to work, reduce the overall welfare spend as part of the sustained effort to repair the public finances and ensure the safety net of social protection remains firmly in place for those who need it most.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I welcome the Minister. It is somewhat of a challenge to know exactly where to start. A former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, said once in a different context that it was the little things that tripped one up. When one looks at any of the individual provisions and measures contained in this Bill, the Minister has quite cogently argued a justification for all of them. Cumulatively, however, one can see that a pattern emerges whereby two sections of society are being singled out and targeted in this regard, namely, the young and the not so young. For example, last year the Government cut over 1 million home care hours for the elderly, shut down the mobility allowance, cut the respite care grant by 20%, and reduced the fuel allowance from 32 to 26 weeks. All that impacted directly on the most vulnerable, including older people. </p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Other changes that have directly affected the elderly include the abolition of the telephone allowance, increased tax on solid fuel as a result of the extension of the carbon levy, rising costs of medical insurance driven by Government policy, a 500% increase in prescription charges, changes to the income threshold for medical cards and the ubiquitous property tax that is currently a cause of great debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> It is interesting that the discussions seems to be centred around administration. I wonder what the debate will be like when people have to stick their hand in their pocket and pay out double in the coming months what they paid this year. That is when the real test of the Government will come about. As I have stated in the past 12 months, people have had enough. They have been tipped over the balance in terms of what they can give. I do not believe they can give any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">This budget and particularly the measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will tip people over into more poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> As the Minister has outlined, the main provisions are the reduction in jobseeker's supplementary welfare allowance for those aged under 26 years, the abolition of the bereavement grant, the reduction in maternity benefit and adoption benefit and the abolition of the mortgage interest supplement. The Minister put her own spin on the reduction in the numbers on the live register. While we on this side of the House would welcome the numbers on the live register continuing to reduce, the savings the Minister is making are quite substantial. As she has said, every 10,000 fewer people on the live register results in a €95 million saving. Given that trend has been continuing for 16 months, the Minister might have fought a bit harder to ensure her budget was not attacked as much as it has been. As part of the Government spin, we had the kite-flying exercise indicating that it would be in excess of €400 million and it is now approximately €280 million. It is still a significant sum of money that targets two specific categories.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> We oppose the Bill, which consolidates the Government's deeply unfair budgetary policies which have been independently verified as regressive by the ESRI and the European Commission in 2011 and 2012. It targets older people and young people who are out of work. It is anti-elderly and anti-youth. It fails the basic test of fairness. The legislation will result in the second cut to core social welfare rates since the Government took office with the reduction in jobseeker's allowance, child benefit having been reduced last year. It will also see the abolition of schemes which support the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> We condemn the Government's latest insult to young people, that being its slashing of jobseeker's allowance. The cut in the core rate of income support along with the Government's failure to implement effective labour activation measures will push more young people towards emigration. The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed has stated that the Government has abandoned those up to 26 years of age on the basis that it will provide them with all sorts of training schemes, education, back to work schemes, etc. which have not worked to an appreciable extent. In families where money has been sucked out, how will 18 year olds live with the reduction in jobseeker's allowance? How will they be able to manage the necessities of life that everybody has, especially those reaching 18 years of age who, for a variety of reasons, may not be able to proceed to third level education?</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> These changes will result in a cut in payment to those engaged in the JobBridge internship programme as interns only receive an allowance of €50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement. The Labour Party's commitment to secure core rates of welfare is in tatters given the budget 2013 cut of €10 to child benefit and the budget 2014 cuts to jobseeker's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> Brid O'Brien from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed has stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_329">It is extraordinary that people can vote at 18, but in our social welfare system you're not seen as a fully adult until you're 25, and if this measure comes through you won't be seen as a full adult until you're 26. I think it will send out a very negative message to young people in this country, many of whom feel they don't have a future here.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">That is a sad commentary. While I do not necessarily appreciate negative sentiments coming from any source, particularly when it relates to emigration, it seems to be the sad reality faced by young people aged from 18 to 26 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Live register figures show that during 2012, 41,000 people under 25 years were without work for four months or more. In September 2013, 66,183 young people under the age of 25 years were on the live register. When all these numbers are added up, including the thousands affected by the various schemes the Government has withdrawn, those affected by the withdrawal of the mortgage interest supplement and those impacted by the withdrawal of the bereavement grant, it adds up to quite a few electoral quotas in the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> We are opposed to the cruel cut to the bereavement grant that will hit mourning families at their most vulnerable time. The bereavement grant of €850 is paid out to an average of 22,000 families per annum who are eligible under a minimum of PRSI payments to help deal with funeral expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I was astonished to learn that funeral costs in Ireland vary from anywhere between €3,000 to over €10,000, depending on where one is living. I was genuinely gobsmacked when I saw those figures because it had never occurred to me that funerals could cost so much money depending on what part of the country one lived in. Perhaps there is a question to be raised about how these costs are arrived at, rather than simply criticising the Government for the withdrawal of the grant. This raises fundamental questions about the marketplace, why it costs this much and why there is such a variance in the cost. The variance can range from €3,000 in one part of the country - this probably applies to where I live, in the north west - while for those in Dublin it can cost up to €10,000. Why should it cost more in Dublin? In many cases, there are shorter distances in terms of the facilities and the services being provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I reiterate that the removal of the bereavement grant hits the elderly in particular. It compounds the hike in prescription charges, the reduction in medical cards and the abolition of the telephone allowance. All of these changes will leave pensioners struggling to make ends meet and there are a fair number of electoral quotas contained in that particular age cohort. The Minister should note that they are the people who go out and vote. We believe workers who pay PRSI contributions deserve financial support at the extremely expensive and stressful time of the often-unexpected death of a loved one.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The maternity benefit standardisation will hit women and their families at a time when they are already struggling with reduced income and increased costs. A reduction of maternity benefit will force many women to go back to work earlier than they would have wished. That is the statement but the question in reality is whether they will have work to go back to. While jobs are being created, perhaps, in the country, they seem to be in one particular category, the high-technology area. If a person happens to be computer literate or moving up the scale in that particular category, then there are probably jobs available for him or her, but for the broad mass of the population, especially those who live outside Dublin, there are few job opportunities. The cut means a de facto reduction of €32 per week for the majority of women who would have received the maximum weekly rate of €262 in maternity benefit. This change will affect approximately 45,000 women and the figures keep going up.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The Government's decision to abolish the mortgage interest supplement will jeopardise thousands of home owners throughout the country. A total of 13,000 families are in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, while throughout Ireland over 143,000 families are in mortgage arrears. The mortgage interest supplement is provided for people who are unable to repay the interest owed on their home loans. We have had this debate previously and we have discussed how to some degree the banks have been getting off scot free with the payment. They Minister quoted the figure of €300 million with nothing coming back from the banks. However, I add the following caveat. Under the recent legislation, ultimately, the veto rests with the banks in terms of how they are going to restructure or reschedule mortgages and that issue needs to be examined. I am unsure what the evidence suggests thus far because it is too early to say, but it seems that if the banks continue to hold a veto, then those who are struggling in particular, especially in the light of the ending of the interest supplement, will be totally at the mercy of the banks and may be unable to agree to the new scheduling of loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> The number of waiting days for entitlement to illness benefit has been increased from three to six days. The Minister says this will save €22 million. However, the Free Legal Advice Centres organisation has already pointed out that those who will be caught in this category will have no money at all. They will be obliged to stretch their money now and in some cases they will be unable to look after basic essentials. There really is a downside to the increase from three days to six days in illness benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The Government cut over 1 million home care hours for the elderly and shut down the mobility allowance. I have mentioned that the Government has also cut the respite care grant by €20 and reduced the fuel allowance from 32 to 26 weeks. I stated at the outset and repeat now that all of these measures directly impact on older people and the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I commend the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the Government for this Bill which comes at one of the most difficult economic periods in the history of the State. The Bill reflects the Government's commitment to tackling poverty and protecting the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> The fact that there are 34,000 extra people employed in Ireland means that there are 34,000 extra taxpayers rather than social welfare recipients. The Government's work during the past two and half years has enabled the Minister to do a difficult job in a balanced and fair manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">As employment continues to increase, it will mean more people will move away from social welfare dependency and become taxpayers and contributors, which will ease the decisions that must be made in future budgets. The State pension, the carer's allowance, the fuel allowance, the electricity and gas allowance, free travel, the half-carer's allowance and the disability allowance have not been touched. Moreover, it is important to note that child benefit also has been protected and there has been no cut to the mobility allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> As I already have stated in this Chamber, the Government inherited a passive social welfare system that did not empower the people it was supposed to protect. During the period between 2005 and 2007, when the economy ostensibly was strong and the unemployment rate was at a very low level of between 4% and 5%, Ireland had a very low work intensity rate that oscillated between 13% and 15%, while the European Union average was just 10%. Research undertaken by the ESRI in 2012 indicated that a specific policy approach is required to address the issue of jobless households as even during the boom years of the early 2000s, the rate of joblessness at household level was very high by European standards. The ESRI concluded that this reflected structural factors that had little to do with the recession. A window of opportunity now exists for long-overdue reform of the social welfare structures, on which the Minister is taking the lead through a range of initiatives including the roll-out of the Intreo offices, JobBridge initiatives, the European Union guarantee, the Tús scheme and the wage subsidy schemes for employers, as well as through the tackling of poverty traps such as, for example, the replacement of rent supplement with the housing assistance payment scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> There has been much comment about the ending of the bereavement grant and it is important to note the full facts in this regard. There are a number of additional supports available for people who have experienced a bereavement, such as the widowed or surviving civil partner grant, which is a once-off payment of €6,000 where there is a dependent child, or the provision of continued payment after death whereby the deceased person's payment continues for six weeks to his or her spouse or partner who also is in receipt of a weekly welfare payment. This can be worth up to €1,380, depending on the payment the deceased person had been receiving. If a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease, a special funeral grant of €850 is paid. For those with particular difficulties who are unable to afford to pay for the funeral, there is the possibility of an exceptional needs payment, which is means tested and for which the average payment made is €2,000. In 2012, the Department spent €2.5 million on such payments. These supports are still in place and I reiterate it is important to have all the facts. I agree with Senator Mooney that there is an onus on funeral homes to consider the cost of funerals and it is quite alarming that they can cost up to €10,000 in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> As for the telephone allowance for landline rental, I understand the Taoiseach has asked both Ministers, Deputies Joan Burton and Phil Hogan, to consult Community Alert organisations to put in place a process by which security pendants can be used through a mobile telephone system. It is important that people still have the security of being able to contact a local Garda station through that pendant system and given the advances made in digital technology, this should be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> In order to incentivise young jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and to attempt to avoid the risk of such people becoming welfare dependent from a young age, the changes made to jobseeker's allowance rates in 2009 are being extended. This decision was made on foot of ongoing consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by the Government. It is not discriminatory but rather is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker's payment at a young age and without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from an early age. If those concerned do not improve their skills, they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age. Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment. All jobseekers aged between 18 and 25 years who participate in back to education allowance schemes will receive €160 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I commend the Minister for tackling fraud in the welfare system. It is crucial that social welfare is there to support those who need it most. People who abuse the welfare system are taking from the most vulnerable in our society. This demonstrates the up-front and fair approach the Minister is taking in managing our welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I am delighted to congratulate the Minister. I support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the Minister. It is important to realise that this is the sixth in a series of cumulative cuts for many people. While we are discussing individual cuts in the Bill, I am very aware that many families and individuals have been hit six times in one way or another. It is my third time to discuss the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I feel slightly disillusioned because of the way the budget process is handled in Ireland. No matter how we cut and slice the Bill, it is about how we make political decisions. There is a strong public perception that the decision has been made to target vulnerable groups and hit already stretched families and individuals. I look at countries such as Denmark which has an open and transparent budget system. The Danish Government lays out the budget targets, debates in which people will get involved ensue and then the budget decisions are made. I question our processes, including the way we can invite groups to appear before committees such as the Joint Committee on Health and Children without any real influence on the decisions that are made in the budget process. This is an issue for a wider debate on another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Today, I wish to discuss the aspects of the Bill on which I have particular concerns and have tabled three amendments. First, I will address section 5 dealing with maternity benefit. I understand the rationale for the cuts and the argument that it will bring the level of payment up for some and down for others, but it will decrease the payment by €32 per week for 95% of the recipients. This reduction will affect the vast majority of recipients. Any parent will be able to articulate the significant costs associated with newborn babies. The cuts have a cumulative impact and this comes on top of the cuts in the 2012 budget, in which the maternity benefit was taxed and reduced the real value of the payment even further. The National Women's Council of Ireland has calculated that in less than one year the cut to maternity benefit is nearly €3,500 per mother. I have the details of that calculation. We know from studies conducted internationally and in Ireland and Government reports that the first year of a child's life is very important. I have major concern that over two budgets we have cut that payment by €3,500 per child. That is a matter of concern. I have similar concerns on the adoptive leave and the rate of payments to a person adopting a child as the same arguments will apply. </p>
          <p eId="para_351"> As the Minister will be aware from my e-mail last Tuesday, to which she responded with detailed answers, I have substantive issues with section 9 which deals with jobseeker's allowance. I am extremely concerned as are others about these cuts to the payments to young unemployed people. I think it is regressive and is likely to exacerbate the difficulties these young people are already experiencing trying to get into employment and training. I am also very concerned about an urban-rural divide on this issue. It is easier for those based in Dublin to go for an interview, but the young people who are based in rural areas may have great financial difficulty in getting to the interview. Some young people who are offered a three month job placement face obstacles when going on and off social welfare benefits. This is a major issue because it is difficult to have one's allowance restored after a three month placement.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I refer to the availability and appropriateness of training places and to the youth guarantee. I do not believe we are investing enough, nor do I believe enough has been announced. Over the years, there have been successive cuts to youth organisations. I am interconnecting these issues because it is all about young people and the message we are sending to them. I listen to the narrative which is saying to young people that it is to incentivise them to go to work but the figures do not support that. During the boom times, the take-up rate among young people was the highest across the European Union. Young people want to go out to work and want to be in education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I am concerned the OECD report, Getting Youth on the Job Track, which was only published this September, clearly stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_354">A comprehensive national strategy to tackle the very high unemployment rates among young people is lacking. Youth policy is fragmented, with several Government departments taking individual action. A more co-ordinated and tailored approach to the youth unemployment problem is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">It is talking about Ireland. That is probably at the heart of the issue. We can debate the cuts but it is about the alternatives for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> In 2011, 40% of our young people aged between 16 and 24 years were at risk of poverty. That is the highest rate in the European Union and that is the group whose payments we are choosing to cut. It is at the highest risk of poverty, but we are saying we might cut the payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I asked for details on the €32 million in savings on the basis of the cuts to jobseeker's allowance. I also asked for the estimated number of recipients affected and was informed that it would be 13,767 for 2014, which does not tally with the figures I worked out. The reply to a parliamentary question asked in September showed there were 20,853 young jobseekers aged between 21 and 24, the two years affected by the cut in 2014. That does not take into account any new entrants. If I take the €72 million saving to be made and do a simple calculation of the €44 per week, it shows 31,468 persons are affected. I will go back to the Minister's Department because the sums do not make sense and I cannot work out these figures. I am trying to understand how many places and how many young people we are looking at.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The Minister highlighted the back to education allowance scheme, but a person must be 21 years of age to qualify for that scheme. There were 25,000 people on that scheme in 2013, of which 6,500 were under 25 years of age. That is approximately 26% of the people on that scheme. The Department said it was not possible to be precise when giving a number for the total of education places available for young people. Part of the problem is that we do not know the number of places available. We are saying to young people that we want to encourage and incentivise them to take up appropriate training and work, but I am hearing from young people that the places are not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> In regard to the savings from the cuts, the Department said the cuts will affect 13,767 people. I estimate the figure to be approximately 20,000, but even if we differ on that, the reality is that the answers I have received show there are 5,250 places available. Where is the incentive? Young people are told that for every job for which they apply, there are 32 applicants. We are sending mixed messages to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> I mentioned the youth guarantee. The Department said it had held consultations. There was a briefing on the youth guarantee on 14 October last and there was a general presentation by the Minister's Department and some discussion in smaller groups. Organisations were invited to make submissions to the Department. The plan is being finalised by an interdepartmental working group, but nobody, including me, as a Senator, and organisations working with young people, has any idea what is in that plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">An Oireachtas committee will meet tomorrow at which organisations such as the National Youth Council of Ireland will be represented but they do not know the detail of the plan. Will the Minister come to the House for a debate on the youth guarantee and the plan the Government will submit to the European Commission on labour activation measures for young people? All of us regularly consult organisations that represent the group to whom I refer and a debate would be healthy.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">I welcome the Minister and thank her for dedicating so much of her time to the House this week to discuss this Bill. I commend her for her achievement in reducing the adjustment in the social protection budget to €290 million from €440 million. A total of €220 million of this will impact on recipients, which is almost half of what was sought, and this is critically important. Despite all the pressure for a €440 million reduction, the Minister fought successfully to reduce it by half and this is clear evidence of the work of a Labour Party Minister in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> One cannot expect to take €220 million out of the social protection budget without pain. There is no doubt difficult and painful measures have had to be incorporated into this Bill but we must bear in mind that social protection accounts for 40% of the Exchequer budget. Spending reductions could not, therefore, have been avoided in this area. While hard decisions have had to be made, the Bill contains positive measures. Last year, the Minister said she would not make further cuts to child benefit until safe and affordable child care is in place. She has been true to her word by not implementing further reductions to child benefit and she has once again protected core social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I would like to highlight a number of beneficial measures that are being introduced such as the €14 million allocation to a youth guarantee fund and the extension of the school meals programme to almost 200,000 disadvantaged school children. The current spend is €37 million per annum, which was increased by €2 million in this year's budget, and the scheme will be extended in the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> While the €100 jobseeker's allowance payment is being extended to the age of 26 years, I remind Senator Paschal Mooney that his party introduced that rate first.</p>

          <from>Senator Marie Moloney<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T15:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">This is the game of politics. When one is in opposition, one looks at all the bad things while when one is government, one looks at all the good things. Unfortunately, that is politics in Ireland. The Government is reinvesting more in jobs, education, training and activation measures than it is taking out with this adjustment. For example, €1.6 billion is being allocated to the revised Pathways to Work strategy in 2014. It is time that attitudes towards young people, particularly those who are out of work, changed on the part of employers. I listened to a recent radio interview about the differences in internships between this country and others. In Ireland, many interns are given mundane chores to do and they are pen pushing in many cases with little or no stimulation in workplaces where they should be learning and benefiting in the long term by improving their career prospects. In other countries, more hands-on training and engagement is provided and an intern feels part of the workforce. The attitude of some employers needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> The changes to the jobseeker's allowance are part of that change in attitude towards young people. We have moved towards incentivising young jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and are trying to avoid a scenario where they become welfare dependants. As Senator Hildegarde Naughton said, it is not discriminatory but rather a specific target aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency, which is a reality in Ireland. It is argued that this is encouraging emigration and while I have no doubt that some people will emigrate, it will not be because of social welfare payments. Nobody will stay in Ireland because of the amount they receive in social protection payments. That will not stop them emigrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> What will stop young people leaving this country is the availability of jobs and employment and the financial and emotional stability which follows from that. The Government's focus is on jobs; on getting people off social welfare and into work. That is why, in 2014, the Department of Social Protection will spend more than €1 billion on work, training and education places and related supports for jobseekers. This is a significant increase of €85 million on the allocation for 2013. Furthermore, while the reduction in jobseeker's allowance for young people will lead to a saving of €32 million, the Government is investing €46 million in youth employment initiatives. Turning 18 years of age and moving immediately onto social welfare is not the answer. We must be more ambitious for young people. In this regard, I welcome the commitment to reduce the threshold for eligibility for the JobsPlus scheme from 12 months to six in the case of persons aged under 25 years. It is anticipated that this will bring an additional 1,500 people into the scheme in 2014. I look forward to that objective being achieved, along with the aim of targeting 1,000 additional places for young people on the Tús scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> In a week where five technology companies announced their intention to set up business in Ireland, we must bear in mind the importance of being job-ready. Nobody is better at technology than young people. However, Louise Phelan of PayPal had an important message to convey last month when she announced the creation of 1,000 new jobs in Dundalk. While she praised Ireland as a destination for investment, she also expressed a concern that members of the younger generation are not hungry enough to get ahead in their careers and are woefully unprepared when they enter full-time employment. She also pointed out that Irish workers do not have sufficient language skills to fill more than half of the jobs that will be available. That is why we are moving towards getting young people job-ready, by enhancing their language, technology and other skills. We must be sure they are ready to take up jobs as they become available.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> Another very welcome provision for which the Minister should be commended is the change in activation arrangements for older jobseekers. Under the current system, any unemployed person aged up to 65 years must be available for work. From the beginning of 2014, however, anybody aged 62 years and over will not be required to comply with that condition and will not be penalised for failing to do so. In addition, jobseekers in that age category will be required to sign on only once a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I very much welcome the provisions requiring insurers to repay welfare benefits paid by the Department of Social Protection for loss of earnings arising from injury or accident where the insured person has also been compensated for the same loss of earnings through a settlement. The principle is that a person should not be compensated twice in respect of the same injury or accident. The expected savings will be €21 million in 2014. As it stands, insurers are entitled to reduce the amount of a settlement in respect of loss of earnings from an accident by an amount equivalent to the social welfare benefits and to retain that money for themselves. Under this change, there will be a legal obligation on insurers to repay the money to the Department. I cannot understand why this anomaly was not addressed years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The changes in regard to the bereavement grant and telephone allowance have caused a great deal of concern and unrest. It is important to note that the bereavement grant is not a universal payment. For example, people with a lifelong disability or owners of small farms who are in receipt of a farm assist payment would not be eligible for the grant. In fact, heretofore, half of what was being paid under the grant was going into estates. In other words, the beneficiaries of wills were claiming the payment. Under the new arrangements, anybody in need of financial assistance at the time of a bereavement can go to his or her community welfare officer and request the burial grant, which averages out at some €2,000 rather than €850. This will ensure that those who need it most will continue to receive financial assistance with funeral costs. This is in keeping with the principle to which we all subscribe, that social welfare is there to assist those most in need. What we are about here is real reform - making sure it is those most in need who get help.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> There are other supports available to people after a death which the Minister has maintained such as the widow's pension, widower's pension, the six weeks payment after death for those bereaved, as well as the widowed parents' grant, and the over 60s household benefit concession for widows and widowers. In respect of the telephone allowance, it is important to remember that the Department of Social Protection expenditure is increasing yearly for elderly people as demand grows. Examples include the living alone allowance, the over 80 allowance, the free fuel allowance, the free television licence, free travel scheme and the companion travel scheme, along with the electricity and gas allowances, all of which have been maintained. We tend to forget what has been retained when one allowance is taken away. The telephone allowance has become quite outdated, however, given the wide variety of telephone services and packages now available. I understand that one company has already absorbed the cost of this change. I welcome the commitment of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to invest more funding in alarms for the elderly, which up to now were one of the main reasons for the retention of a land line. I have spoken to the Minister for Social Protection and asked her to look at the cost of reinstating the allowance for those over 66 years in receipt of the living alone allowance or those with a dependent adult. I welcome the fact that those over 66 years will not be liable for the extra PRSI and unearned payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The budget continues the Government's process of repairing the public fiances, while doing all that is possible to protect the most vulnerable in society. The loss of our economic sovereignty under Fianna Fáil has left the country's finances in a sorry mess, but through the measures in this Bill and the budget we can begin again to look forward to restoring our economic independence and ensuring the people benefit accordingly in the long term.</p>

          <p eId="para_380">I welcome the Minister. I do not envy her job. I think she is one of the two outstanding Ministers of the Government, the other one being the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, but I do not agree with him ideologically. I would not start from there, but then again I am a socialist. In fact, I would be tending towards communism and think it is very important to put the people first. The live register has fallen below 400,000, but that does not take emigration into account; therefore, it does not confirm that the right measures have been taken. If we look at the state of the country, the morale of the people, the general financial condition of most families and the huge amount of emigration of our most talented people, then I do not think we can congratulate ourselves on anything. We are not really exiting anything. We are going to be still in the same stranglehold with the same financial institutions and I wish them damned in hell. The people should come first.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The Minister said young people were not best assisted by welfare payments because work, training and education supports were much more beneficial in the long term for young jobseekers, but that is not the case when these are not sufficient to get them into a job or when there are not sufficient jobs available. This is terrible. In a theoretical sense, the Minister could possibly be right if she took that point of view, which I do not. However, it is not correct to say that the cuts will create incentives for young people to take up education and training. This is the "flat screen television in Tallaght" argument in a slightly milder form. As these cuts will hit 21,000 people and we have 3,250 new places, there is a huge discrepancy involved. Therefore, it is simply not accurate to say that this will have the effect of shifting people off the register. I congratulate the Minister on halving the cuts that her Department was asked to introduce. That is why I say she is one of the best Ministers in the Government and I do not envy her job. However, these people have already been means-tested and when they live with their parents, their parents' income is taken into account. We see from an analysis of this that it is always the low-income families that are being affected. That is something that should worry all of us, as representatives of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The second issue of particular relevance is jobseeker's allowance and the single parent tax credit. We have all received letters from people on the single parent tax credit and they are all individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We have all received a circular letter as well, which makes a series of relevant points. Very often they are prefaced with a personal story which is interesting and highlights the situation. One of them is from a man who states, "I am a single father to four amazing kids and I pay maintenance of €900 per month". He is getting €137 per month, but that is being taken from him. That is dreadful. This man is paying a very significant amount and is trying to be a good father, but he is being discriminated against. There is another from a man who says, "For years we have been an invisible class in society, our names have, in many cases, been removed from our children's lives by the stroke of a pen upon a birth certificate." The rights of single fathers must be taken into account. It will adversely affect all single, separated and divorced fathers and mothers. In addition, if a single parent's income drops below a certain level, it will mean they will be less able to do anything for their children. It is also likely to create further tension between separated parents if they squabble over this. There is a human development as far as this is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> There is also the issue of the Equal Status Act. I have been briefed that research from Trinity College Dublin points to the fact that in 97% of separation cases in the State, the courts deem the child's mother to be the primary carer, even in cases of 50:50 access. That is another anomaly. In terms of the language, some people feel quite sensitive about the idea of being a secondary carer. I know what is meant by that, but there might be another way around it. Another person begs that we:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_385">Do what is right for our dignity and our children. €2,500 is not worth tearing apart our relationships. It is soul destroying.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I have two other questions for the Minister. One is about the illness benefit. The Bill doubles the time one must wait before claiming from three to six days. That means people on very low incomes must try to put together a float of a week's wage to carry them over. This is worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The final matter is very important. I was briefed on it by Focus Ireland, a wonderful organisation. It is concerned about the impact of the reduction in the social welfare rate for people under 25 years of age. It believes this might lead to an increase in homelessness among young people. It calculates that approximately 200 people will be affected, which is a small number, but in times of devastation in their lives, it is a problem. Homelessness at an early age often leads to chronic homelessness. Perhaps the Minister might contact Focus Ireland to seek a further briefing on this and to see if some accommodation could be reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> I will conclude on the telephone scheme. I was amazed to hear that the telephone benefit was being removed, particularly in the light of the current situation where elderly people throughout the country are being attacked. Many of them only have landlines and they might not find mobile phones easy to use, even if they could afford them. This is such a mean-minded measure. I would probably be eligible for it now, although I have never applied for it and do not want it. I do not believe in taking things I can afford to pay for myself. However, my heart bleeds for the two old ladies in Donegal, one of whom was hauled out of her bed, banged on the head and left on the floor. Without a telephone such people are completely vulnerable.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the Minister but, like Senator Norris, I do not envy her her job. It is not an easy task at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I will concentrate on a couple of matters and one of them is the effect on employers. Will the Minister put my mind at rest regarding the sick pay scheme, to ensure we are not increasing the cost to employers?</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> The other point I wish to raise is an anomaly or, perhaps, an error. The allowance for married couples is double the allowance for two single people. In all cases, including income tax, it is recognised by the State that a couple allowance is exactly double that of the single allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I would like the Minister to put my mind at rest in regard to the over 70s couple medical card eligibility criteria. It is proposed to reduce the over 70s couple allowance to less than double that of the single allowance, that is, for a single person it is €500 and for a couple it is €900 instead of €1,000. It is clear that if the over 70s couple medical card eligibility criteria was in line with other parts of our legislation, the allowance for the couple should be €1,000. I believe this is a discrimination against married couples or civil partners aged over 70. To be clear, if the eligibility criteria for a couple was, as custom and practice has it, double that of a single person, namely, €1,000 for a couple, a couple would retain their medical card. However, as it is proposed in budget 2014, with the discriminatory allowance of €900, which is less than double the amount of a single allowance, a couple would lose it. I ask the Minister to put my mind at rest on that because I do not believe it is fair. There should be equality. I would be glad if the Minister could address that issue because it appears to be one where an amendment could be considered to rectify that anomaly. </p>
          <p eId="para_396"> We must make it clear that it is sensible for people to work. The Minister has put a great effort into that and referred to it a number of times but over the weekend an article in the<i> Irish Independent</i> stated: "While the Government bats around statistics saying that the vast majority of people are better off working, the Economic and Social Research Institute notes that 8% of the unemployed would lose money by getting a job [that is not what the Minister said, at least it did not sound like that], meaning the reality is that thousands of householders are disincentivised to work". To put that starkly, the <i>Irish Independent</i> found that a family could be €4,000 a year better off on social welfare than it would be with one parent working full-time in a minimum wage job. That is an amazing finding to consider. It arises because it includes jobseeker's allowance with additional payments for a spouse or partner and children, child benefit, fuel allowance, back-to-school allowance and rent supplement. Will the Minister comment on that? Does the Government not accept that if all the associated benefits that go with being unemployed are added up, there is a big difference between that figure and the salary of a low-paid job? I am glad the Government is moving towards making rent supplements based on financial need but if we then remove medical cards from those who move to work - they will now only get them for one year instead of three - we could be shifting the entire problem and not setting the conditions for people who want to get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> As I mentioned previously on several occasions - the point is worth repeating - it was highlighted recently that one in every seven people on social welfare has never worked a single day in their lives. Other reports show that one in three people offered a place on the back-to-work scheme failed to show up for interview. That is a huge factor. The benefit was recently called unemployment allowance until the Minister changed it. However, how can one be unemployed if one has never been employed? To me, one must have been employed to be unemployed. The Government says that it will follow the model of not giving benefit to a person who refuses a job or training, as happens in countries such as the Netherlands or Germany, but will that ever happen? It would be political dynamite to alienate so many thousands of voters. However, we have to say that if a person refuses a job or training, one simply cannot go back to receiving social welfare for the next number of years. That will not be a popular thing to say and the Minister has said that the Government is moving in that direction. The figures from the Economic and Social Research Institute seem to bear that out. I would like the Minister to consider these points and respond to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Senator Deirdre Clune<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T16:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_398">I acknowledge the point made by the Minister that originally €440 million was to be taken from her Department's budget and that figure was reduced to €226 million. She had a similar story to tell us last year. However, as others have said, these spending reductions will still have an impact. Budget 2014 was about getting people back to work while at the same time ensuring that payments in respect of the State pension, carer's allowance, disability benefit and child benefit were all protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Budget 2014 was about getting people back to work and at the same time ensuring State pension, carer's allowance, disability and child benefit payments were protected. I acknowledge that some changes were proposed. I will go through some of the measures that will have an impact on individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> I do not think it has been mentioned in this debate that work is the single greatest protection against poverty. It should inform everything we do. All of our efforts should aim to ensure people return to work. While the figures are good, they are not good enough. We need to go much further. The creation of 3,500 jobs a month in the past year has had a positive effect on the economic balance sheet and on the lives of individuals and their families. Many payments have been protected, as I have said, but others have not. The reduction in the level of jobseeker's allowance paid to those under the age of 25 years has been criticised by many people. The Minister made the case very well in her opening remarks when she said there is an emphasis on creating training, education and internship places across a range of programmes to ensure young people have the necessary skills for employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I heard criticism this week of the 300 jobs being created in the technology sector, on the basis that they are not suitable for everybody. I accept that they are not suitable for everybody. We should bear in mind that for every job created in employment backed by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland, up to 1.5 further jobs will be created in the community. Anyone who has read the Fast-track to IT report will be aware that a range of skills are needed in the technology sector. It is not just about coders and programmers. A range of skills are required across the board. Many young people who used to work in the construction sector, after finishing their trade apprenticeships, are finding meaningful employment in the IT sector. We should bear in mind that a range of skills are needed in the IT sector. It is not necessarily all about high level coding and programming.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I would like to speak about the job activation measures in place. A positive Indecon report, which looked at the success of the JobBridge scheme, referred to the success of those who have participated in the scheme in gaining employment outside their internships or the organisations they were in. It is very positive and it continues to be positive. I look forward to seeing how the Minister will conclude this country's programme under the youth guarantee initiative towards the end of the year. This positive development, which was finalised under the recent Irish Presidency of the European Union, is focused on getting young people back to work and ensuring they acquire the right skills. The proposal in this Bill to reduce the jobseeker's payment received by young people, as proposed in the budget, will ensure there is a focus on what is available to young people, how they can be supported in getting back to work and offering them the necessary education or training placements. We have given a commitment to this effect under the youth guarantee fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the welfare fraud initiative. I welcome it because it is important for us to know that action is being taken. The introduction of the public service card will be of assistance in that regard. The special investigation unit which will look at organised fraud, suspected non-residency cases and multiple claims will co-operate with Revenue. A range of measures have been and will continue to be effective. I understand further funding is being provided towards that end this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> We should bear in mind that maternity benefit which is being reduced is not a payment towards the cost of rearing children. Child benefit is provided for that. Maternity benefit is provided as an employment support to ensure mothers receive income support during the time they spend on maternity leave. We have come an awfully long way. Under EU law, we are required to provide for just 14 weeks of maternity leave, but we provide for 26 weeks of paid maternity leave and 16 weeks of unpaid maternity leave. This goes a long way to help people who have children by giving them time to bond with and adapt to their new arrivals. It is certainly not meant as a payment towards child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">In many cases, the employer has previously ensured that the mother gets full pay on maternity leave. I suspect that in many cases, those days have gone. We should applaud the way we have moved on in terms of supporting parents with their new children. We have come a long way and should not focus on the payment or cost.</p>

          <from>Senator Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T16:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_406">I welcome the Minister. While there are some very difficult changes, every job is difficult and there are tough choices to make, could the Minister deal with one aspect of complaints we all receive, namely, the length of time for processing claims? I am going to debate some of the cuts she has made, claims for disability, illness and jobseekers, and in particular appeals and the percentage of appeals that are upheld. The percentage of appeals upheld show that some of the decisions made at the very start are incorrect. Perhaps the Minister has some up-to-date details about what percentage of appeals are upheld and granted and could tell us what the turnaround times for processing claims are and what changes, if any, she has made in the administration sections of the Department to ensure that claims are processed as promptly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> My colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, has outlined our party position on this very well and has detailed many of the items about which we have grave concern. I will focus on two or three items. First, I will address the abolition of the mortgage interest supplement. The mortgage interest supplement was one of the few direct measures that assisted people in mortgage arrears and applied to people regardless of whether they were working. In the context of the Government having introduced the new Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act which makes it easier for banks to repossess people's principal private residence and having torn up the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears to give the powers to the banks under the new code of conduct on mortgage arrears, I am interested in finding out what the Government is proposing in its stead. Is it proposing that the State should not intervene to assist the 143,000 households in mortgage arrears that are in grave difficulty? What will happen to these people? I know this covers a couple of Departments but the abolition of mortgage interest supplement is a retrograde step and the Government will be taking the rug from under people who really need this payment. </p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I listened with interest to some Members and some Government colleagues, particularly the Taoiseach, talking about welfare in recent weeks. One headline stated "Kenny declares war on welfare culture". I am not saying the Minister has been guilty of this, but there is a sustained message coming from the Government about welfare fraud and welfare spongers. Tory-style language is being used, particularly from Fine Gael colleagues in this regard. The welfare system is there to help people when they are in trouble. Most of them have paid taxes for this. Will the Minister ask her Government colleagues, particularly the Taoiseach, to watch the language used? Does the Government expect people to feel grateful that they receive assistance from the State when they are out of work or have problems with their mortgages? I believe this notion has crept in in the past 18 months in Government circles. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I was astonished to hear Senator Deirdre Clune commend the Minister for changes to maternity benefit - standardisation as she called it. It is not standardisation. That is language used by focus groups employed by the Government and its spin doctors. Let us be straight about this. This change in maternity benefit is a cut - a €30 million cut. I ask the Minister to confirm these figures. What percentage of women claiming maternity benefit in any given year will the de facto reduction of €32 per week affect? According to the figures I have, standardisation will affect 96% of women.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Only 4% of women will benefit from it. The Minister can call it whatever she likes, but it is a substantial cut. We do not think it is too late to change course and will be tabling amendments through our spokesperson, Senator Paschal Mooney, because the Minister got it wrong in this regard. I support her in the tough choices she has had to make in other areas but the cut - not standardisation - to maternity benefit is wrong. I would like to know what figures are available from the Department. If she is saying it is a standardisation that is saving €30 million, it is effectively a cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> Other issues that are not covered by the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill include the telephone allowance and the household benefits package. In case my colleagues believe the abolition of the telephone allowance will only mean a cut of €9, it was €26 when the Government took over and it is currently €9. It will be nothing from next year. That will affect people. We cannot change it because it is not in this Bill and primary legislation is not required for the cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> These are things that really hurt but even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to reconsider the cut to maternity benefit and the bereavement grant. She corrected me earlier when she said that she supported the reduction introduced by the previous Government to social welfare payments for those aged between 18 and 21 years who were living at home. I take her at her word in that regard but her party vociferously opposed the Social Welfare Bill which introduced those measures. She should not proceed with the cuts to the maternity benefit and the bereavement grant. It is not too late for her to change her mind. A government cannot say that it supports working mothers when it takes €32 per week away from them. It it not standardisation; it is a cut.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I welcome the Minister. The hardest task we have to perform every year is to implement the Social Welfare Bill. I commend the Minister for this Bill because, like others, I was bracing myself for something much worse than what has hit us. Prior to the budget my colleagues and I asked her that she protect people with disabilities, child benefit, the carer's allowance, the half-rate carer's allowance, the respite care grant and fuel, electricity and travel grants. We also asked that middle income workers be protected by way of family income supplement. She did all of this. We had to take €290 million out of social welfare benefits courtesy of the troika that the Members opposite brought to town several years ago. At the time they did not know the troika was in town and now they have appeared to have forgotten that they brought it in in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_434"> There are many married couples who are younger than 26 years. They will not be affected by these measures once they are married. The Senator probably did not know this.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> As regards education and training schemes, I worked with young people over the years as a community welfare officer. I remember people who came into my office to sign on at the age of 18 years and maybe they spent too long on it. I spoke to them three or four years after their term on social welfare and they told me their biggest regret was to have gone on social welfare at 18 years instead of educating themselves. They subsequently continued to go back onto those schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Senator Marie Moloney spoke about the bereavement grant. Some 60% of that money ends up in the estates of deceased people and it is divided out among family members. As Senator Paschal Mooney said, it is the little things that trip one up. He may prefer if bigger things tripped us up, but if he has any other little measures he could recommend to the Minister as an alternative to some of the measures she has taken, we would be delighted to hear them. Senator Paschal Mooney spoke about the cost of funerals, home care packages and the bank veto, as if they were the Minister's fault. None of these things has anything to do with the social welfare budget, however.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I am grateful to Senator John Kelly for so generously sharing his time. I welcome the Minister, but we cannot welcome these cuts. Not even the Minister has suggested for a second that anyone welcomes cuts of €290 million in social protection. Any such cuts for those who qualify and are reliant on social protection are harsh. They are hard cuts that affect individuals and families. No one is defending those cuts here. In the context in which they were delivered, however, the Minister has brought off the miracle of the loaves and fishes in the way she has done it. She has tried to be fair-minded and even-handed. I commend her for her creativity in cutting the subvention to RTE by €5 million instead of imposing that cut on pensioners who rely on their television and television licence. That is the kind of creative reform we require.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> It always bewilders me that while people talk about abuse and exploitation in the area of social protection, every time a Minister comes forward with reforms, people are up in arms saying it cannot be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">Our colleagues and others have listed several of those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">There are a couple of things on which I still have questions and I will table amendments and oppose certain sections of the Bill. I have issues with the timing of some of the Minister's decisions and some equality concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I support Senator Jillian van Turnhout's comments on maternity benefit and adoptive benefit - Fianna Fáil Senators also raised these issues. Last year maternity benefit was taxed and this year the rates are being cut. Senator Jillian van Turnhout referred to the National Women's Council's concerns in this regard. Barnardos has described the cut to maternity benefit as anti-parenting and rightly called attention to the fact that Ireland is behind in comparison with our EU counterparts, in offering only six months maternity leave and no paid paternity leave or parental leave. This is not a child-friendly measure and we appear to be regressing in this area. I echo Senator Darragh O'Brien's call for the Minister to consider reversing the maternity benefit cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I am concerned about the mortgage interest supplement, also mentioned by Fianna Fáil Senators. Many people rely on this payment to stay in their homes. Recent Department of Finance figures for Ireland's six main lenders indicate that three quarters of mortgages that are over three months in arrears have yet to be restructured. As we learned from the appearance of bank representatives before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform in September, they are not meeting the Central Bank's target in a satisfactory manner. If lenders adequately engaged with borrowers, this change would not be of such concern. In this regard the issue is with timing. As it is, the change risks people not being able to support their mortgages, with their homes ultimately being repossessed, thereby incurring further costs to the State. The programme for Government specifically identified the mortgage interest supplement as a better and cheaper option than paying rent supplements.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I have concerns about the changes to the young jobseeker's payment in sections 9 and 10. I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout for her extensive research and the questions she put to the Minister in terms of how the figures stack up. The changes being made assume young people can fall back on their parents for either a place to live or additional income. This is often not the case for a range of reasons, including financial circumstances and family breakdown. It also assumes that young people have become reliant on a so-called "welfare culture" and need even greater incentives to train or work. With a youth unemployment rate of up to 30% and thousands leaving the country because of a lack of opportunity, such assumptions are, at best, unfounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Senator David Norris mentioned that Focus Ireland stated that since the young person's rate was introduced in 2009, homeless services have experienced an increase in the numbers of homeless young people. While I welcome there has been no reduction in the budget for homelessness this year, previous cuts and a continuing rise in numbers of homeless people are putting severe pressure on services.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I have some questions on sections 13 and 14 of the Bill, relating to the recovery of payments on foot of personal injury actions. These matters take up several pages of the Bill and I know many technical issues are involved. I understand colleagues in the Dáil tabled amendments, but there was little time for clarification. It is great that we still have a Seanad in which to raise these issues. As I understand it, sections 13 and 14 provide for the recovery of illness-related social welfare payments from compensation awards made to people as a result of personal injury claims. I understand the change means that instead of the insurance company reducing compensation to the person by the amount paid out by the Department, the Department will now recover the amount directly from the insurance company. Is it correct to say that such a social welfare payment may not now be made unless the person claims from an insurance company?</p>

          <p eId="para_468">I thank the Minister for the comprehensive way in which she has dealt with this matter. It is difficult to try to bring forward reform when dealing with this matter and to try to be fair but I believe the Minister has done a good job in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I welcome the development on the issue of insurance. I do not believe taxpayers should be responsible for paying out wages and salaries in real terms because that is what social welfare does. It steps into the breach to pay income to people if they are out as a result of an accident. Insurance companies are not responsible for paying back that money. We should be careful of several things. I have been involved in this area for several years and I am aware of cases where awards are made by the courts in which the judgment asks how the matter is to be dealt with. Will the court order have to make a specific award with regard to what is paid back to the Department? Is this covered in the legislation? This is something we should be careful of because I have encountered cases where the court makes an overall order, but sometimes it might suit people if the payment is to the plaintiff without a specific order with regard to what is refunded to the Department. This should be examined. For argument's sake, let us suppose an order was made for €80,000, part of the claim involved €20,000 in loss of earnings but the general damages are assessed also. It is important that clarification is given in the court order and that the claimant is not left exposed with regard to claims afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The important thing is that proper procedures are set up. I gather the legislation covers this with regard to ensuring that insurance companies refund the money. However, a question arises where there is no insurance, where claims are made and where judgments are obtained. This is another problem that arises and it has occurred in several cases I have come across. I have encountered cases involving some particular areas of the insurance industry. I know of one case involving a nightclub whose owners are doing their own insurance. That is something we need to be careful of also.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Another issue I am keen to raise relates to people in the building industry who lost their jobs five or six years ago. Some of these people are in their mid-50s now and believe they are no longer able to go back to the type of work they were in. We need to consider this in the long term. I have come across several people in the age group from 55 to 65 years and I believe this is one of the issues we need to address.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I realise there have been some changes in respect of people aged 62 years, but I find that once people go over 55 years there is a problem. Anyway, I welcome the change for those aged 62 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Another area on which I wish to touch relates to a person who became unemployed and who was then in receipt of illness benefit for a period. The person is now keen to do a community employment scheme. A person came to me recently who was told that it would not be possible to go into the community employment scheme because the person was on illness benefit. The person had applied for disability benefit and the doctor had advised that the person should not go back to the type of work that had been done previously. The person may be suitable for light work but cannot get into the community employment scheme. The person was in receipt of social welfare for a period of five years but has been now advised that it will not be possible to get into the community employment scheme because of the requirement to be on jobseeker's allowance for a given period.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">That is the information I have received thus far and while I await some further answers on it, the person concerned became extremely frustrated with me on foot of not meeting the qualifying criteria for beginning community employment because he was in receipt of illness benefit, as opposed to jobseeker's allowance. While his doctor now has indicated a return to light work would be appropriate, he is finding that he does not qualify and consideration might be given to this issue. Overall, while it is difficult to make changes, those made in this budget are welcome. The Government must make continuous improvements in this regard and efforts must be made to encourage people back into the workforce at the earliest possible date. In addition, the necessary incentives must continue to be created and obviously, jobs must be created to which people can return and begin earning in the same way as they had previously.</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_476">Were the Minister and her party in opposition, they would undoubtedly be opposing the Bill. I have no doubt about this because this again is an Fine Gael budget that is being supported by the Labour Party. As the Labour Party spokesperson for finance in 2010 and in response to the budget then introduced by Fianna Fáil, the Minister accused that party of introducing measures that provided nothing but pain for the poor, money for the rich and the rolling back of the State. Nevertheless, in recent years she and her party have supported budgets that also have incurred pain for the poor and which have given money to the rich. Not a cent extra in income tax has been levied on higher earners in this budget, yet there have been cuts in social welfare payments and there certainly has been a rolling back of the State. Moreover, young people, older people, the sick and the vulnerable have been targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I will begin with new mothers and the cuts to maternity benefit, which come on the back of the reduced maternity benefits that came into effect from July 2013, when they were subjected to a Labour Party-imposed tax. The majority of maternity benefit recipients will have their weekly payment cut by €32, which amounts to a cut of €832 over the course of their six-month leave. For those mothers who are fortunate enough to have their maternity benefit supplemented by their employers, the cumulative impact of this cut could entail a shrinkage of their benefits by up to €126 down to a payment of €135.70, which constitutes a potential loss of more than €3,000 per annum. The charitable organisation Barnardos has described the cuts to maternity benefit as being anti-parenting, callous and unsupportive and a number of other charities also have been critical of the Minister's budget. They point out that Ireland lags behind many EU countries in offering only six months maternity leave and as yet still has no paid paternal or paternity leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> If one considers child benefit, the cuts in respect of the fourth and subsequent children formally announced by the Government last year will take effect from January 2014. Despite the Minister's assertion that child benefit has not been cut this year, as those cuts will come into effect this year this cut comes within this budget. It is clear that larger families are being targeted again and by their very nature, they are likely either to have less income because one parent is at home with the children or, if both parents are at work, incur higher child care costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I will now turn to young people, jobseeker's allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance. Speaking in 2010 as Labour Party spokesperson, in response to what she and I both rightly perceived to be a vicious Fianna Fáil budget, the Minister, as her party's spokesperson, stated, "the principle of the Labour Party is that we are a one-Ireland society and those who have most should contribute most." When the Minister spoke of those who have most, was she talking about young people under 25? Do they have the most? Were older people who are in receipt of the telephone allowance those to whom she was referring as having the most? Was she referring to people who now face having their medical cards taken away from them? Are they those who have the most? I do not believe they were the people about whom the Minister was speaking when she was in opposition, which brings me back to the point I made earlier. Were the Minister standing where I stand today, I have no doubt but that were the same budget introduced by Fianna Fáil, she would be on her feet opposing it because it is unfair and because it is not those who contribute the most who have been asked to pay extra.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">An individual who earns in the range of €150,000 to €300,000 or more per year is not being asked to pay a single extra cent in income tax. It is the young, the old and the sick who are being asked to pay the price in this budget. Is the Minister suggesting young people can take this hit as they in her words "have the most." This cut is particularly disgraceful. Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, the Peter McVerry Trust and a number of other NGOs that work with homeless people have said the cut could push vulnerable young people to the margins and increase the risk of them becoming homeless and ending up on the streets. The National Youth Council of Ireland estimates the cuts will impact on 20,852 young jobseekers in 2014 and the numbers will grow year on year. The Minister paints a picture that the cut in the social welfare rate for the under 25 year old will benefit them, in fact she is doing them a favour. She is pretending the job placement schemes, the labour activation measures and jobs are available in the numbers that are necessary. Is this a return to the lifestyle choice that the Minister spoke about a number of years ago? She obviously does not get the fact that there are insufficient labour activation measures and jobs and that this will impact in particular on the young people who live in disadvantaged communities. They will find it very difficult to get a job or a place on a labour activation measure and are the very people who will be deeply affected by the cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> These are "Tory" cuts, cuts one expects from the Fine Gael Party. As somebody who gave the Labour Party a second and third preference vote in the last general election, never in my wildest dreams would I have thought the Labour Party would be voting for budgets like this. It is absolutely appalling that the many people who trusted the Labour Party and voted for them because they would do the correct thing for vulnerable people, feel badly let down.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I have many other concerns which I will raise on Committee Stage. I will not be supporting the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T16:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_483">I welcome the Minister. I pay tribute to the work she has done in defending her Department's budget and defending basic social welfare rates. For all the bluster from the other side, it is fair to say that the anticipated cuts to social protection measures were far greater than the spending reductions ultimately made. As she stated, the Department was initially expected to make spending reductions of €440 million but this was ultimately reduced to €226 million. I know there will be further savings made through fraud and control measures and better management of expenditure. It is still a remarkable achievement given the conditions in which we are working that the Minister has managed to protect the budget to that extent and indeed to protect basic social welfare rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I know Senator Marie Moloney and my other Labour Party colleagues have pointed out that the Minister's priority is to protect the basic rates of social welfare, carer's allowance, disability allowance and the other core weekly payments and protecting also crucial supplementary supports for pensioners, carers and people with disabilities, as well as child benefit. It is also fair to say and I think others on both sides of the House will acknowledge that Deputy Burton is a reforming Minister in spite of the very difficult economic conditions which she has been working with and that she has sought to ensure that social protection and social welfare is a springboard as well as a safety net for people, that it should be transformed as a Department from a passive benefit provider, which has been the tradition, to an active provider of supports and incentives to get people back into work and out of the poverty trap.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The Minister makes the point that social welfare payments should not just be seen in terms of money coming out of the economy but also as payments going back into local economies. That point is well made but it is often overlooked. We are seeing the Government's job strategy working in many ways. We are seeing the beginnings of a downward trend in our unemployment figures, which is very welcome but as others have said, they are still far too high, particularly among young people. Colleagues on both sides have rightly focused on the changes that this legislation will make to jobseekers allowance for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Minister's speech focused on that issue because it has been of concern to groups, including Labour Youth within the Labour Party. We need to interrogate and examine the changes that have been made for those aged 25 years and under. In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said that the dole is no place for young people. The European norm is that young people stay in education and training much later than they do in Britain and Ireland. We have a tradition of leaving school at an earlier age and going into the workplace. That is why the European youth guarantee is so vital. Instead of having people languish in unemployment without prospects and opportunities, there should be education and training if employment places are not available to them. As the Minister has said, it is better to be training than claiming.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> However, it is also important that we consider our own discourse about this. Unfortunately, some language has crept into the debate whereby people are blaming young people or suggesting they are not taking up places that are available. The Minister has always been careful about that and we need to be careful about that. We need to ensure nobody is suggesting that anyone wants to claim welfare rather than taking a work placement or a training placement. The problem is a perception that there is a lack of places or a lack or appropriate opportunities. We need to ensure that is addressed and I was glad to hear the Minister's commitment to providing enhanced opportunities for young people who seek to take up training places, work or education placements.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I look forward to seeing the detailed plan to implement the European youth guarantee, which is to be submitted to the European Union by the end of this year. I hope we will have an opportunity to debate it in the Seanad during which we can consider the measures in detail. The Minister has indicated that an additional €85 million will be spent on supports for jobseekers next year. From the figures provided by the Department I know specific commitments have been made in terms of placements to be made available for young people. The Department of Education and Skills has estimated approximately 30,000 places will be made available for young people in 2014 for PLC courses and 45,000 for third level places. Of course we have back-to-education allowance and back-to-work enterprise allowance schemes which are demand-led and effectively uncapped.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The State has provided access to 80,000 opportunities on employment and training programmes, which enable young people in receipt of social welfare payments to retain them and in most cases to receive a higher welfare payment provided they satisfy the other conditions. The Department of Social Protection has indicated the number of those aged 25 years and under, who will be affected by the budget measure on jobseeker's allowance, is slightly over 14,000 and in excess of 20,000 places are available for that cohort. We need to ensure those places are available in reality and in practice. The concern that both sides of the House share is that people are incentivised at a young age - and at an older age - to take up training and work placements in order to enhance their opportunities of getting into the workplace rather than remaining on the dole indefinitely. That is a very important measure. We should never blame people who are forced through circumstances to stay on jobseeker's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I wish to make a couple of other brief points.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">I thank the Acting Chairman. Others have raised the issue of maternity benefit and adoptive benefit. Many of us do not like to see a reduction in the maximum rate, but there is a bigger issue, namely, getting employers to top up to pay full salary to employees. As a result of work we did on gender discrimination, the Law Society of Ireland now advises solicitors' firms to pay full salary to employees. Therefore, for many employees the employers will pay a top up.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> There has been considerable discussion about the bereavement grant. Colleagues on the other side have raised the very serious variance in the cost of funerals. We need to consider the unforeseen consequences where grant payments may have been inflating costs of, for example, funeral services. In other areas we have seen private landlords effectively being subsidised by the State and rents remaining higher as an unforeseen consequence of benefits. That is all part of a reforming agenda in social protection, to which I know the Minister will adhere.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Senator Mary M. White<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_494">I welcome the Minister. What I am about to say is not critical of the Minister, whom I admire very much.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> This is a vicious budget and is the third regressive budget in the lifetime of the Government. It lacks vision and does not offer any hope for young people. As politicians, it is fundamental that we have a vision for our country and we must offer hope to the people. I want to focus on older people and young unemployed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The cut to the telephone allowance will severely affect older people's ability to communicate and will further increase associated problems such as security and isolation. For many older people the landline telephone is their only line of security in case of emergency. As a direct result of this measure, older people are now more vulnerable to intruders and burglars. Every one of us is conscious of the burglaries, intimidation and savage violence being experienced by older people. One of the Minister's colleagues - it might have been Senator John Whelan - spoke about the two ladies in Donegal, one of whom died of her injuries. That is one of the reasons I call this a savage and vicious budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The Government should have had the guts or leadership to deal with the bondholders and not be so intent at going at 1 million miles an hour to resolve the deficit. I accept we have to resolve the deficit but not at the pace proposed. It is ridiculous that the most vulnerable people are now paying for that. The Government does not have the leadership skill to prolong the repayment to the bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> The removal of the bereavement grant is nothing short of an insult to older people. The bereavement grant of €850 is paid to an average of 22,000 families per annum to help deal with funeral expenses. The abolition means that mourning families will be left without critical financial support during an extremely stressful time. I cannot understand the suggestion that they should shop around and get cheaper funeral arrangements. There is no justification that this grant is being pulled away from people at their weakest and most vulnerable when a family member dies.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> On today's Order of Business I raised the issue of the slashing of the maternity benefit by €32 per week for 92% of the people who receive it. The Government is showing a serious lack of respect for women who, when put in its most simplistic terms, have a dual role in comparison with men. They bear children, and they work and rear children. The men do the work and mind the children. They have no idea what it is like to carry a child in the womb and deliver the child with all the responsibility. It shows a lack of respect for women's contribution socially and economically to Ireland. Women should be commended for working while pregnant, having children and returning to the workplace to advance their contribution to society and to the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Instead of supporting expectant mothers, the Bill reduces the collective benefit by €830 over the six months of maternity leave. I do not know how anybody on the Government side could support this inexcusable measure. It is vicious and lousy - no words can adequately describe the Government's demeaning attitude to women.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> At the other end of the spectrum, the cut to the social welfare payments for young people aged under 26 years will further fuel the emigration of our brightest and best.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Previously, I was an employer for 16 years. We fall far short of having a proper apprenticeship scheme in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">We need a proper apprenticeship scheme similar to the brilliant German system of dual education. One cannot get most jobs in Germany without serving a practical apprenticeship with an employer. In Ireland, there are apprenticeships, which are good in themselves, for electricians, carpenters or plumbers. We have approximately 29 apprenticeships whereas in Germany there are 342 recognised apprenticeships ranging from bankers to opticians.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> It would be far more beneficial than cutting back. I imagine the Minister is aware of the public debate about whether she did the right thing in cutting the jobseeker's allowance from €144 to €100 for those under 24 years. Unfortunately for the Minister, there is an inference that young people who stay at home are lazy and not looking for work. I am proposing what should be done instead. I have an amendment on the matter to help young people get a job. It is very difficult when a person has no experience. Nowadays, employers do not want people who have no experience. How does one get experience? One can only get experience if one is in the workplace from nine to five, eight to four or whatever. That is how to develop a work ethic. It can only be done if one has a job and experience. Instead of a young person of 18 years getting €100 per week, young people who come-----</p>

          <p eId="para_515">In my experience I saw the transformation of young people in Lir Chocolates when they got a job and were able to hold down that job. The only reason I started Lir Chocolates was to create employment. I never heard of the word "profit". I did it to create employment for young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">I welcome the Minister. She genuinely has her heart in the right place. As the previous speaker said, it is difficult to be in a position where one does not have money to spend to solve a problem. Money does not always solve a problem but it can put a sticking plaster on it, so to speak. This Minister is about looking at the grass roots and what will solve problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The budget was difficult for every Department and it was a difficult year to be framing a budget. I know the Minister was put to the pin of her collar to bring forward the fairest budget possible in the difficult financial circumstances in which we find ourselves with the bailout programme and the constraints over our national spending power.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I was always told that it was best to cut one's cloth to suit one's measure and that is what the Minister has found herself doing. We should consider changing Standing Orders in the Dáil and the Seanad such that when a Member states that he or she is against a proposal in a money Bill, a budget or a social welfare Bill, that Member must find an alternative source for the money. If a Member puts forward a proposal, he or she must have a funding source to back it up. I was a councillor for 20 years and when the budget came forward, if a councillor was serious about an alternative proposal and wanted to get it through, he or she had to find a way to fund that, even if it affected another initiative. I hear people from every party say we should not do this or that. What should we do? What is the alternative? If we made the change I have suggested, we would be taken seriously as politicians, rather than being seen as a talking shop where we say we should not be doing this or that. What should we be doing, if that is the case?</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The Minister stated she was asked to find €440 million in savings. She baulked at that and said it was not possible to do it. The Minister should be complimented because she has put up a good fight. She fought the good fight and the figure was reduced to €226 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">I am sure there is something in between. We have come up with an alternative. If we could find the money, I would be the first to say I am sure there is something in between.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Let us look on the positive side. A total of €30 million in savings will be made through additional fraud and control measures. Some €34 million will be saved through increased efficiencies. These are not being recognised in any way even though they are brilliant achievements. A total of €34 million in increased efficiencies will be achieved, and that is as a result of the efforts of the people working in the Department and of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> In addition to bringing the cumulative adjustment to €290 million, the Minister has the information technology systems in the Department of Social Protection talking, as it were, to those in other Departments. That is a major achievement as well and has resulted in greater efficiencies. At one time when one asked a question of a Department or agency, the answer was they did not know because different Departments, agencies or sections within a Department did not talk to each other. The Minister has changed that.</p>

          <p eId="para_527">There have been reductions and it has been hard on some, but the Minister has managed to make payments and to maintain the State pension, the carer's allowance, the disability allowance and the core weekly payments on which people depend. Crucially, supplementary supports for pensioners, including the fuel allowance for gas and electricity, free travel, the half-rate carer's allowance and the respite grant, have been protected. I realise everything that has been cut has been difficult to cut, but they cannot all be protected. I imagine sleepless nights were involved in finding where the cuts would be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The best way to save money is to ensure people have a job. We have seen a reduction of 20,000 in the past year in the number on the live register. It will fall below 400,000 shortly for the first time since May 2009. That is still far too high but progress is being made. With more people at work, the social welfare bill will be reduced and savings will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Next year, the Department of Social Protection will spend €1.8 billion on work, training and education places, an increase of almost €85 million. This is a vast increase. It was an achievement to find any area where funding could be increased in these stringent circumstances. That is a plus and it should be highlighted. A great deal of training is on offer.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">Another issue I want to take up with the Minister is meals on wheels. It is protected and the budget for it is ring-fenced. Tús workers - formerly FÁS workers - provide meals on wheels. I have been working on a scheme since last April and it is proving difficult to get Tús workers to become involved with meals on wheels. If people are not kept in their houses, they go into nursing homes. It is a case of preventative medicine. The Minister should do anything she can to ensure Tús workers - formerly FÁS workers - are available and that it is attractive for them to become involved in order that they can go on to other training and methodologies for advancement. Producing meals for elderly people might not be that attractive. A special effort should be made to ensure people put themselves forward to avail of it. One meal a day could keep a person in her home. What is the cost to the State if she goes into a nursing home? It is an issue for the Department of Social Protection and I have raised it with the Department of Health also. It is about saving money for both Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> It has been mentioned that the youth do not want to be on the dole. It is a matter of training. I have a question on the €46 million allocation to address youth unemployment and the associated youth guarantee scheme from the European Union. It is for the over 18s and I realise it is aimed at people for employment measures and initiatives. Is it strictly for this purpose or could it also encompass people with disabilities to get them into training, education or work?</p>

          <p eId="para_533">I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton. This year's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill brings cold comfort to many, as Members on this side suggest it could have been worse. It most certainly could have been worse and everyone realises this. The Minister achieved a thankless feat of reducing the adjustment from €440 million to €290 million. No Member in the House can dispute that this budget is significantly different from the previous budgets the Government unfortunately has been obliged to propose. While I will stand up and applaud this, I decided these points must be made to at least put into context these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Throughout the difficult three years in which the Government has been in office, the Opposition, both those who are affiliated to parties and those who are not, has stated repeatedly the Government is not protecting ordinary people, that such adjustments cannot be made and there must be money somewhere. I had hoped sincerely that at this stage in the game, they would have woken up from their delusions, particularly those in Fianna Fáil. If there was ever an Opposition party that knew the scale of the task the Government has faced and still faces, it should be Fianna Fáil, that is the party that started the austerity budgets, which is its members' buzz word. I refer to the party that cut child benefit by €16 a month in budget 2010 and by €10 in budget 2011 and which cut the carer's allowance from €220.50 to €204. It is the party that cut the blind pension from €204 to €188 and which also cut the widow's pension from €204.30 to €188 after the most devastating budgets in living memory. This point must be remembered.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> Historically, Sinn Féin also appears to jump on whatever bandwagon is on the move. It believes there must be money somewhere and all of our budgetary issues could be solved by taxing the wealthy. It is unfortunate that no Sinn Féin Member is present in the Chamber. I agree on one point, namely, the wealthy in Ireland should pay their share and have no dispute on that matter. However, the Sinn Féin pre-budget 2014 proposal is as one-dimensional and as regurgitated as were its pre-budget submissions in 2013, 2012 and 2011. Members of Sinn Féin stand up in both Houses to disparage the decisions of the Government and in particular the measures included in this Bill and its counterparts, year in and year out. However, members of Sinn Féin stand up in Stormont and introduce social welfare changes that by their own admission are flawed and targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. The social welfare Bill that was allowed to pass by Sinn Féin in the North introduced changes and cuts that disproportionately affected women. Moreover - this sounds familiar - low-income families and lone parents were forced to access debt, discredited tests were used to judge the sick and disabled, along with further measures that threaten to take away benefits from those who refuse work and cuts to housing benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> While I concede the Government has made harsh decisions and compromises, it has never lost sight of the end game, namely, to regain control of the country and make it a more sustainable place for our children. It is easy to make easy decisions. On the most cynical level, not a single member of the Cabinet, the Labour Party or Fine Gael has anything to gain from cutting services and benefits from people. It is safe to state not a single person on either side of the House entered into politics to take or to cut from people. The Minister has had no easy task in the Department of Social Protection. I commend in particular that further cuts were not made this year in the area of disability. She has continued to expand the JobBridge scheme, has overseen the drop in live register figures, has made sure that budget 2014 provided significant money towards job activation measures and has rationalised many social welfare services with the introduction of the Intreo offices around the country, which are customer-service oriented. The Minister has also been working tirelessly behind the scenes on the youth guarantee and has secured €14 million of funding, while the Government continues to work on funding from the European Union. I acknowledge that Members on the other side of the House will complain that not enough is being allocated to this project but I will remind those Members of the Opposition that it is not about how much money one allocates but about how one uses the money one is given.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryBrennan" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Senator Terry Brennan<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_537">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. I read recently that a family of two adults and four children could be €4,000 per year better off while in receipt of social welfare than a similarly sized family in which one parent took a job on a minimum wage. This beggars belief and I must ask whether it should not be the other way around. It still is more attractive and more beneficial to claim the various State benefits than to take up a low-paying job on the minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I also read recently that in the case of a family of four in which no one was working, social welfare entitlements including rent supplement and so on would deliver an annual income of €33,185. I met a young businessman who told me how he offered a job to a man who was on the dole, as was his wife, and who had four children. I have mentioned this in the Chamber previously but the businessman offered him a job at €40,000 per year. In addition, he stated he would give the man 5% of the anticipated profits in the company he envisaged he would create. He was a good man and he wanted the man in question to work for him. When I asked him to quantify the aforementioned 5%, he replied it could mean a further €10,000 to €12,000. In other words, the job would yield an annual sum of approximately €50,000. However, that young man with four children did not take up the job. The businessman would not tell me who he was - he was not from my native county - but this was an example of situations in which small and medium-sized enterprises offer men and women jobs of such significance, €40,000 is no mean wage, that are not taken up. Thankfully, the jobless figures are falling and as the Minister noted last night, 34,000 jobs were created last year. Moreover, 3,000 jobs per month have been created subsequently, all of which is to be applauded. The issue of social welfare fraud has been mentioned previously but I must ask whether enough is being done or can be done to identify those who fraudulently are taking social welfare payments. One may ask how successful are the initiatives in locating such fraudsters. Rent supplement is paid to more than 82,000 households at a maximum rate of €823 per month, which amounts to almost €10,000 per year to those in receipt of it and that is a significant amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> The Minister, Deputy Burton, who has left the Chamber, stated recently that responsibility for rental assistance would be transferred from her Department to local authorities with the new rental subsidy system, in order that people would not lose out when moving from welfare to work and this is to be applauded. I had intended to ask her when she hoped to transfer this new system to the local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">Very well. Reform of the welfare system still is in its early stages and there still is much more to do. The Government is moving to put in place more jobseeker case workers from external service providers. Moreover, the Minister is targeting the welfare traps that prevent families from taking up work and I applaud her for so doing. She is to be congratulated on her proposals to date in reducing welfare fraud. However, as I stated, more must be done in this regard to keep to a minimum the incidence of fraud.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I am not making an issue of that at all. The social welfare system is a shambles. Perhaps some official would note my query on what seems to be a policy emanating from the Department or the Minister to rural social welfare offices that they delay, defer and if possible delete claimants? I am in public life for almost 30 years and I am appalled at the delays in the system, the application and appeals systems. There is a lack of communication with clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Let me give one example of a young man who approached me. I raised the issue with the Minister and she responded by letter stating that the jobseeker's allowance applies when the person is unemployed, capable, available and genuinely seeking employment and satisfies a means test. This young man went to an office in west Cork, which I shall not name. His father, who was seeking farm assist was sent to a different office. Additional information was sought from his father which was eventually supplied but after some delay and this had an impact on his son's application. The application of the young man was closed as he failed to produce documentation to support his claim. His father was to supply that information but he was dealing with a different office. This is not an unusual example. I think it is a deliberate attempt to ensure that both the father and son are crucified, as they live in remote and difficult circumstances. I make no bones about it, whether the Minister is present.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> My second point relates to a person living in the Beara Peninsula who has applied for farm assist. The Department is insisting on him going to a bank. He has no bank account and the nearest bank to him is in Bantry town, 56 miles away. The man is living on the breadline. The Department needs to apply common sense and allow people to use the local post office. Post offices are closing left right and centre from a lack of business. The post office in Alllihies is barely surviving and the young people in that peninsula must travel to a bank because of departmental policy. Is that fair or reasonable? The point is that people in rural areas are crucified by this policy, which is very unfair. It is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> My next point relates to the carer's allowance. A separated lady whose elderly parents both in the nineties needed her full time care and attention for many years applied for the carer's allowance in April 2012. To date, 19 months later, she has not received one penny. Her father has died in the meantime and her mother has now gone into a home. I reported on this case without mentioning names in my local newspaper <i>The Southern Star</i> and the Department suggested I was exaggerating and talking rubbish. As of ten minutes ago, that lady has not received a single penny for looking after her parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Let me give an example of delays in the system. After a delay of 12 months a person whose farm assist payment was reduced was offered a payment of €112 per week with a <i>mandamus,</i> that if he did not accept the compromise payment he would remain on the reduced rate of €25 until the appeal would be determined, which would be nine or 12 months down the road. Members may not realise that the average time it takes for an appeal to be processed is from nine to 12 months. Never before in all my days in public life, did I know that the Department can offer a sop, but if one decides to go through the appeal process, one will be on the reduced amount during the nine to 12 months wait for the appeal hearing. That is unfair. It is a type of blackmail.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The abolition of the death grant was the wrong thing to do at this time, but the abolition of the telephone allowance was mealy-mouthed. People in certain rural areas cannot get reception for their mobile phones and depend on the land line. It was suggested that they use broadband. In parts of the Mizen Peninsula we cannot get narrow band not to say broadband. The officials need to travel down to Allihies or go to remote areas in counties Donegal or Kerry and see what is really happening in rural areas. Ten years ago we did not have a problem with social welfare because there was nearly full employment. I know we operate within financial constraints, but the ordinary citizen must be afforded respect when he or she applies for social welfare. The attitude now seems to be, "if in doubt, cut them out". I am aware that people now go to the Society of St Vincent de Paul, and go for counselling.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> I rarely speak on social welfare Bills, but I could speak for another half an hour raising incidents that occurred in my constituency. I am worried and appalled that as a public representative I cannot do more for them. The officials in the Department need to wake up and be fair to people. The situation is very serious and it will get worse.</p>

I would not be happy with the length of time it is taking to process applications and get appeal decisions. However, Senator Denis O'Donovan must remember that it is not that long ago since his party was in government and cut every social welfare payment in a budget. Unfortunately in this difficult economic climate, some reductions must be made. We all wish we were not in this situation, but the Minister for Social Protection did well that the cuts were confined to €226 million out of a budget of €20 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">There are cuts in the budget but there are some positives in it as well. Some €1.08 billion will be spent on work training and education places and related supports for jobseekers, which is an increase of €85 million over this year's figure, is to be welcomed. The Minister has placed great emphasis on work training and education. The fact that a young person on turning 18 years automatically goes on the dole must be stopped and should never have happened. We want to ensure we are much more ambitious for young people. That ambition must be fostered and developed as they go through the education system at all levels. We must also ensure the situation which applies in some cases where several generations of some families have never worked is addressed and reversed for the future. Every young person should be helped to achieve his or her full potential. I hope the Minister drives on that initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Another positive is the reduction in the time period a person must be unemployed to be eligible for the JobsPlus scheme. This scheme incentivises employers to offer more job opportunities to young people. This scheme, together with the provision of 1,500 extra places on the JobBridge scheme and 1,000 places on the Tús scheme, are all positive developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> The ring-fencing of an additional 2,000 training places by the Department of Education and Skills and income supports for an additional 2,000 people who will avail of Momentum courses provided by the Department of Education and Skills is very welcome, as is the provision of €2.5 million by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to make funds available to young entrepreneurs via Microfinance Ireland and other start-up schemes. I hope that will help young people who developed skills during the boom times in our country and that some of them will be incentivised to create employment opportunities for themselves and possibly an additional person.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I welcome the provision, not in the Bill but in the budget, of funding for 100 new breakfast clubs that will benefit children in disadvantaged schools, which is a positive move. Almost 200,000 children benefit from that scheme. I am aware how valuable the scheme is because I have practical examples of it working on the ground. It is only right and proper that a child should not have to participate in the education system without being properly nourished.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> There are aspects of the Bill that I do not like. I would have preferred if the bereavement grant had not been eliminated but I accept that when resources are scarce we must help the less advantaged, and the exceptional needs payment is the vehicle through which that should be done. I welcome that the widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner grants remain untouched. In many cases the bereavement grant goes into part of an estate, and it is not required in many cases, but people on low incomes require that payment and I hope there will be flexibility in that regard and that we will ensure that the people on very low incomes who come under real pressure at the time of the loss of a loved one will be able to access the exceptional needs payment without any great difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> I regret also that some people will see a reduction in their maternity benefit payment but I am pleased that the duration of the payment remains unaltered.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> I applaud the Minister for her efforts in tackling fraud because we must not allow the most needy in our society to suffer as a result of unscrupulous people who are cheating the system. I think it was Senator John Whelan who referred to the free travel scheme, which I am pleased has not been touched, but I agree it is being abused. There is no security or traceability regarding the travel passes. There is no excuse for not tackling fraud, and I am glad the IT systems in the various Departments are talking much more easily to each other, so to speak, but I would like to see the free travel scheme tightened up in a way that only people who are entitled to it get to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> I seek clarification from the Minister on those in the 18 to 24 years age bracket who will receive the €100 per week or €160 per week if they engage in training or education. What will happen if they are unable to access a training or education place? Will those people be eligible or will they qualify for the €160 if they are willing and able to participate but there is no opportunity for them to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Senator Denis O'Donovan referred earlier to the difficulty many people were experiencing with the appeals system. I have had the same difficulties on a number of occasions. The system is cumbersome and is taking too long. What steps are being taken to make it easier to get decisions from the Minister's Department and, where people appeal those decisions, what assurances can the Minister give us that in the coming months we will see a shortening of that particular timescale?</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> In general, the Bill is positive. There are some aspects of it that------</p>

          <from>Senator John Crown<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_570">I welcome the Aire to the House. What could be a more difficult job to be given than that of Minister for Social Protection and Minister for Health during a recession and at a time when the demands for the services increase, especially in the case of the Department of Social Protection, for all the understandable reasons, while at the same time the tax base which has to support it goes down? It is a very difficult task and the Minister should not think we are not appreciative of it. With a task such as that, as Rahm Emanuel said, no good crisis should go to waste. There are times for creative thinking, and perhaps creative destruction of some old processes, and ideas that look outside the box in terms of the way we deliver certain services.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I have stated, more in the context of health debates over the years than in the case of social welfare, although I believe it applies in both, that spending money on health is spending money on social welfare. Public spending in general is not wasteful but wasting public money is always wasteful. It is never a good idea to waste any resource. All resources should be used efficiently. The maximum amount of benefit must be extracted from them and their impact should be maximised at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Historically, the way we have devised social welfare systems - certainly the way we have devised the health system - has not maximised the outputs we get for the substantial inputs we make. I am being a bit of a "Quixote" and tilting at windmills in putting some thoughts into the Minister's head for contemplation during 2014 rather than for amendments that might be made in the course of the debate on the different Stages of this Bill. What do we need? We need more jobs but to get more jobs we will need, among other things, increased inward investment and to get that we will need increased competitiveness. We also need increased revenue to support our very necessary social programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> One must ask if the way we use the money currently deployed for jobseekers is maximally efficient. I am not one of those people who believe that everybody on jobseeker's allowance is a sponger. We had the experiment in this country. We had virtually full employment. When jobs were available people rolled up their sleeves, took the jobs and worked, except for a very small core of people. We had close to zero unemployment here during the height of the economic boom. People want to work. The argument that is trotted out that people are habitual welfare spongers is unfair and untrue, but are we creating the maximum impact for the investment we put into this programme? I believe we are not. </p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I would love the Minister to examine an ambitious, innovative, wholly different, disruptive approach, as it were, in which we would look at the amount of money we give people on jobseeker's allowance and say it provides a little safety net, it does not give a great wage but is the best we can do under the circumstances. I understand that. In the great majority of cases people receiving it would much prefer to have a job where they are making more money, paying taxes and contributing. Is there not a way - I do not mean a JobBridge type idea but a much more fundamental approach - that we would engage with employers in the private sector and ask them if they would be prepared to top up to at least the minimum wage or, more appropriately, to what they pay people who are doing a job, the amount of money we give them, which would be the equivalent of what that person would be getting as their jobseeker's allowance? If €270 or whatever was deployed to a company and the person who owned the company topped up that figure by another €150 or €200 to make a truly living wage, the person in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance would make more money and pay taxes, and the company would have a highly competitive member of its workforce which would give it a competitive advantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> other parts of the world. </p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I have asked that of a number of people I know who are substantial employers throughout the country and they said they would snap the hand off somebody who made such an offer. They would love to be able to increase the numbers of people in work. It makes absolute economic sense. It is good for the worker, the State, the company and the economy. There are people in Brussels who would object but we have another large group of people who are unemployed, namely, lawyers. We have many unemployed and under-employed lawyers as a result of the collapse in the conveyancing business and we could use them to gunge up the people in the European court for years as they disputed our attempt to get everybody back to work and by the time they possibly won their case, the recession would be over. I put that thought into the Minister's mind and hope she will give me some credit for it when she implements it.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> When I came back to Ireland in 1993, I was stunned to find that even with the relatively high income I had, my family qualified for allowances in respect of my children. I understand all the arguments about it but one wonders whether a portion of that allowance could be given in a form of transactional currency that is only expendable on children. While the great majority of families in receipt of the allowance need it for general household expenses at a time of great stringency, some are abusing it. This is not like the old food stamps idea; technology has moved on. There are many ways a percentage of the children's allowance could only be spent on children's food, clothing and so on and not as a currency that could be transacted to directly benefit the adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> The Minister's opportunity to stamp her name across history will come if she critically examines the issue of mandatory retirement in our public service. Senator White has introduced legislation, which I was honoured to support. When Bismarck introduced the old age pension in Germany in the 1880s, the average age of death was 42. One received a pension at 65 years and if one lived to that age, on average one lived for another two years. Now the average life expectancy is the late 80s. The system is based on a biological premise of a life expectancy which is wrong. I will not get into the issue of whether people should be able to avail of discretionary retirement but people who work in the public service who have no desire to retire are being forced to become dependants on the State at the age of 65 years and that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> I refer to "perverse incentives", a phrase we use in medicine, where a well meaning incentive is put into a system and it has an unexpected to outcome. Will the Minister comment on the wisdom of setting a deadline of 1 January as the date beyond which the bereavement allowance will no longer be paid and what implications that might have?</p>

          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_579">I welcome the Minister. Senator John Crown made a number of interesting recommendations and suggestions, although I am not sure where he was going with the final question. I share his sympathy with anybody who holds the Minister's brief or that of the Minister for Health but one cannot give a clean bill of health to everything contained in the legislation. I cannot support it. It will cut social welfare benefits to the young, remove mortgage interest relief for the unemployed, cut pension payments and telephone allowances for the elderly, maternity benefits for mothers to be and abolish the bereavement grant. What I do not like about the Bill and Government policy in general - this is not the first Government to engage in this behaviour - is the way in which people who are seen as not being capable of fighting back are often targeted and singled out for additional targeting. I also do not like the way issues are flagged in advance and people are frightened and distressed during the budget planning and announcement and the political triangulation involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I do not like the way the Government gives with one hand and takes with the other. For example, there is little point telling older people they can have free GP care if they cannot afford their medicines. There is an astonishing amount of fear and concern among them. I was in touch with the family of a young man who is battling cancer. He has a medical card and he is wondering whether he will lose it. I cannot understand what is going wrong with our system of communications from the highest level downwards when people are exposed to this level of fear. We are told we need to make all these adjustments to exit the bailout. The cuts in the Bill will save the State approximately 4% of the amount it will pay next year in interest payments on the portion of the national debt attributable to bailing out the banks. That is what the suffering in the Bill amounts to in terms of us abiding by the demands of the troika.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The telephone allowance of €9.50 a month will be abolished in the new year while eligibility for the over 70s medical card will be tightened, which will mean tens of thousands of people losing free health care. Approximately 35,000 older people will lose their full medical cards but in an attempt to avoid a repeat of the grey army revolt when pensioners forced a U-turn on a similar issue in 2009, the Government has offered GP care. I have commented on the political approach being taken. The Minister for Health urged pensioners not to worry. He said, "I know that older people may feel they are having something that is being taken away but this has been replaced with the free GP care card so they don't have to worry about the cost of going to a doctor". Has he thought about cost of medication, transport and so on? This cut will cost so much to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Age Action Ireland says that the abolition of the telephone allowance will hit those most dependent on it to keep in touch, particularly those who are housebound or live alone or live in remote areas. I agree with the organisation's chief executive Eamon Timmins who said, "This payment was recognition that older people's needs are different from other sections of society and that the phone plays a greater role in keeping older people well." In marginal communities in the west, Border and midlands, older people rely on the telephone as an essential lifeline to the world around them. Many find themselves isolated. It is not like Dublin where people have reliable mobile phone coverage or broadband access, as Senator O'Donovan said. What about older people in Connemara or on the Inishowen Peninsula? People rely on their telephone line for their house alarm or to keep in touch with friends and relatives, the health services and doctors on call. The Government is not only content to reduce the number of Garda stations and run down local services; it is isolating old people further, which is contemptuous. That is what I mean by particular categories of people being singled out unfairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> This latest cut comes on top of many more. I was struck by the words of an elderly woman I met recently who participated in the protest march outside Leinster House. She was visibly upset about the abolition of the telephone allowance. She lives in an isolated area in County Monaghan. She is widowed and her children have emigrated to Britain and Germany and her means of communicating with them is being attacked as she sees it. These cuts are not only about the monetary impact; it is about how they make people feel and where they leave them in terms of their sense of vulnerability. Does the Minister think that mother can webchat with or Skype her children? She cannot because she does not have broadband coverage, which means she will not have the contact she would like with her children. I wonder whether there is an indifference to the isolation and the mental health dimension to all of these cuts. At a time when we have task forces on cyberbullying and increased concern about mental health issues, this seems ill-thought out at best and cynical at worst.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I am sorry about the Government's record on defending older people, in particular, and that these cuts are excessively disproportionate. Prescription charges hit everybody equally but some people are not in an equal position to bear the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Many Members have referred to the abolition of the bereavement grant. Has the Government considered the irony of what it has done? Less well off people should feel entitled to lay a loved one to rest with dignity and not have to resort to borrowing money but politicians who have an interest in attending large numbers of funerals will no doubt continue to collect votes and charge mileage as they do so. This was a particularly shameful thing to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_590">I thank the Leader for his flexibility in allowing me the opportunity to contribute. I very much welcome the flexibility he is affording us to debate the Bill in detail on its various Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> We all appreciate that we are living in stringent times and that the demands on the State's social welfare budget are extremely high. At the same time, the very purpose of a social welfare budget is to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves, including people who cannot access employment, either through their own initiative or because the jobs are not available, as well as the elderly and disabled. These groups of people are often classified by interest groups and Members of this and the other House as being the most vulnerable in our society. There comes a time when a society must be judged in accordance with how it treats its most vulnerable. That assessment can only be benchmarked against the assistance that is available through social funds such as the social welfare budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> In the case of the changes that were announced in this budget and are set to be transcribed into law by way of this Bill, a question must arise as to the Government's commitment to those who are less well off in our society and those who are most vulnerable. That commitment seems particularly doubtful, as outlined by colleagues, when key allowances are being cut for people who cannot provide the relevant services through their own means. The withdrawal of the telephone allowance, for example, will affect a large proportion of elderly people throughout the country, including many in my own county of Donegal. Many of these are living in isolated rural areas where there is not even mobile telephone coverage, let alone broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> This is a matter of protection within the home for elderly people. Members on all sides of the House have spoken about the plight of elderly people living alone and in fear. A neighbour of mine who recently suffered a break-in has no mobile phone coverage and does not own a mobile device. He does, however, have a landline, yet this elderly and partially disabled gentleman will now lose his telephone allowance. That is not right. Moreover, it is happening at a time when it is more clear than ever that bankers are being protected by the Government. Despite the promises made before the last general election, not one banker has lost a single penny in pension entitlement or remuneration. On the other hand, the most vulnerable people in our society are losing their telephone allowance. To put this in context, we, as Members of the Oireachtas, receive a telephone allowance of €750 every 18 months. Why was that provision not touched in the budget while the €9.50 per month telephone allowance for elderly people was removed? It is absolutely outrageous and disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I had hoped to speak about youth unemployment but the Cathaoirleach is indicating that my time is up. We will deal with that in detail as we move through the Stages of the Bill. Young people are being penalised and driven from this country as a result of changes in this budget. Bus loads of young people from my own county are leaving or have already left because they are not willing to live in a country where they are penalised for being young. Why should a person aged 27 years be entitled to a higher payment than somebody who is two years younger? Is the second person worth less to the State? I strongly contend that he or she is not.</p>

          <p eId="para_595">I thank Senators on all sides of the House who contributed to the debate, particularly those who put forward useful proposals. This is the third successive budget in which the Government has protected all weekly primary welfare rates. I have met extensively, on a weekly basis from April onwards, with organisations advocating on behalf of older people, carers, people with disabilities and so on. Their number one priority, as they laid it out to me, was that weekly rates be retained. Perhaps that will come as a surprise to some Members. I was somewhat surprised to discover that the second priority, particularly for older people, was the free travel provision. Third on the priority list was support in respect of heating and fuel costs. I did my best, in the context of my discussions with the representative groups and with people on all sides of this House and the Dáil, to reflect those priorities in the decisions I had to make. Accordingly, we have protected the provisions that were identified as priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I emphasise to Fianna Fáil Party Members that there is no change, in Donegal or anywhere else, in regard to welfare supports for young people aged 18 to 21 years. In fact, the change for that age group was introduced by Fianna Fáil in government. Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill was a Member of this House when the then Government introduced it. Moreover, that Government reduced the weekly rates for people with disabilities and others by more than €16 per week.</p>

As I said - I am not sure whether some of the Members now present were in the Chamber when I said it - from 1 January 2014, we will be offering employers, through the JobsPlus scheme, a monthly cash grant of €300 - equivalent to €75 per week - in respect of any person they take on who has been out of work for between six months and two years. Where a new employee has been unemployed for more than two years, a higher cash-back payment will apply.

          <p eId="para_608">Senators will appreciate that it is a difficult job to find the resources to finance everything I would like to provide. In regard to work incentives, we are opening up the JobsPlus scheme to include people under 26 years of age who are unemployed for six months or more. JobBridge is already open to those who have been unemployed for three months. We have to get employers in this country, as they do in Austria and Germany, to play an active part in finding a solution. At a recent meeting of the Global Irish Economic Forum I spoke to many Irish people who are living and working in countries like Austria and Germany and were astonished to hear of the lack of places in Ireland for traditional apprenticeships. In those countries, such apprenticeships cover a huge range of occupations, with both entry-level and middle-level jobs available. People who excel in these positions often subsequently go on to further academic and career success.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">It is very important that we send a message this evening asking employers to think creatively.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Can they take on some extra young people who unfortunately have found themselves unemployed and give them an opportunity to get working? We have already had 22,000 people on the JobBridge internship scheme. The report from Indecon shows that 60% of those people go on to further significant work. We have had 9,000 employers and other organisations host internship opportunities. I am very confident that employers in Ireland want to help people who have found themselves unemployed. We have made the new JobsPlus arrangement as simple as we can make it. It is-----</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I certainly hope the review of the apprenticeship scheme being carried out by the Minister for Education and Skills will become one of the opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The mortgage interest supplement was also raised by many Senators. In recent years during this crisis, the Department of Social Protection has spent €319 million on mortgage interest supplement. I would like to outline two cases by way of example. In the first case, the family have a mortgage interest supplement for six years on a loan of roughly €250,000, which after six years is still €250,000. The Department of Social Protection will have paid €54,000 in mortgage interest supplement. The problem is that the banks have been laughing all the way to the bank. That money is paid directly to the bank and not to the individual couple. In many cases, the scheme severely restricts their capacity to go back to work to take fully paid employment because they will lose the supplement. The place for these arrangements to work out is between the bank and the individual through the mortgage resolution process. I want to assure Members that we will do this over a four-year period, but it is important to help families caught with mortgage interest support.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> In the second case, the Department has paid €66,000 in mortgage interest to a bank over seven years, with no outcome in the reduction of the loan arrangement or any other resolution arrangement by the bank. What I hope to see is banks entering a resolution process in order that people can then get on with their lives, keep their family home, and in the case of people on mortgage interest supplement, return to full employment. The scheme, as it has operated, has not done that, but this will be phased out over a four-year period to take account of the different situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> This year the Department will pay €44 million for the telephone coverage, mostly to the biggest provider in the field, which is eircom. There is a challenge for everybody here, including those in business. The eircom package costs roughly €27 per month. The biggest charge on an older person's telephone bill is that standing charge of €27 per month, of which the Department of Social Protection pays €9.50. This is an extraordinarily high standing charge for the fixed line. The actual call costs on an older person's bill are between €4 and €7 per month. A number of telephone providers have already come forward to offer older people enhanced deals. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides €250 per year, but it is conditional on having a land line. Technology is advancing and this is becoming more mobile. I saw one of the companies offering a very attractive package of €40 per month, which included the land line, a mobile, calls through both systems, a fairly extensive television package and small broadband package. There are ways in which much better offers can be made to people on a social welfare incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Many detailed questions were asked about the youth guarantee. When I became chairperson of the EU Employment and Social Policy Council, I made it a priority to get the youth framework agreed. We managed to do that even though people felt that the EU would not, as an institution, be able to do it. We will now have an agreement by the end of the year among the member states as to what this will envisage. We have already hugely increased the number of places available on a variety of schemes in the Department. Deputies from outside Dublin will be familiar with the Momentum courses, which are being offered to people who are unemployed for more than one year in specific areas with strong employment possibilities like digital skills. As was raised by Senators Ivana Bacik and Jillian van Turnhout, I am happy to come back at a later stage to discuss the youth guarantee in some detail. We do not have all the details. Senior officials from the Department will be at the joint committee on Thursday to outline how the work is going ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> We have to agree this with our European partners, but I hope to see a package provided ultimately, because the European Union will supply matching funding to Ireland under the European Social Fund. It is the first time in a long time that the European Union has done this. I hope it is a return to a more socially orientated European Union that is not just about bankers. The Irish draw-down will be around €32 million per annum. There is matching funding involved, and while there is much paperwork involved - a number of Senators have a lot of experience of this kind of funding - it is a very positive move for Europe as a whole. In the recent statistics, our rate of youth unemployment happily moved downward from a very high 31% to about 28%. That is slow progress, but it is progress nonetheless and it is going in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I know there are different views among Senators about maternity benefits. We have one of the longest periods of State payments of maternity benefit at 26 weeks, when the European request is for 14 weeks. Countries like France and the Netherlands, which have very strong social support systems, actually provide support for 16 weeks. The Irish social welfare system, in the context of the loss of 250,000 jobs after the crash, has maintained a very strong level of payment. The maternity payment remains one of the highest payments in our social welfare system for one of the longest periods of weeks that is available. I am happy to say that many employers pay staff nearly full wages when their employees have gone on maternity leave. Senator ivana Bacik pointed out that solicitors and the Law Society of Ireland have reached an agreement to keep people at their full rate of payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Senator David Norris raised the issue of homelessness. The Department of Social Protection's role regarding homelessness is to support homeless people through income maintenance. Homeless people have an entitlement to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowances and associated settlements. The Department works through the homeless persons unit and the asylum seekers and new communities unit. Where a young person is leaving care we have specific arrangements, formerly with the Department of Health and more recently with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> With regard to the bereavement grant, as Senator Paschal Mooney showed in his example, there is a contrast between the cost of funerals in different parts of the country. It ranges from €3,000 to €10,000, which is very striking. I do not know the reason for that, but it certainly merits an inquiry. There is a range of supports for people who are bereaved.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">The key support is that if somebody's spouse dies, particularly a pensioner's spouse, we continue the payment of the person who has died to the person who has been bereaved for a period of six weeks. That support is worth approximately €1,300 to the bereaved spouse. It is far more significant than the bereavement grant. Second, if people become widowed or a survivor and they have children aged 18 years or under, they get a cash grant of €6,000. That cash grant is paid if they have children up to 22 years of age still in education. Again, that is far more significant support than the bereavement grant. As some Senators pointed out, an amount of the bereavement grants goes to estates, whereas we are focusing the very significant cash supports on the immediate relatives, the spouse, widow or widower and the child or children, who were dependent on the person who has died.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I was required to reduce the budget by €440 million. Fianna Fáil in its plan for the troika would have reduced it by a further €200 million. That is in the history records if Fianna Fáil Members wish to see what its proposals were.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">We got it down to €226 million and they are very difficult decisions. Everything in social welfare affects an individual, a family or a community. However, on balance, we have a budget that strongly supports people to get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> I listened with interest to the contribution by the Sinn Féin Senator. When I last checked, Sinn Féin has been in government in Northern Ireland for a long period of time and the payment to young people of the ages we are discussing is the princely sum of £57 per week, which is equivalent to approximately €67 per week. It is not that Sinn Féin does not care about young people in the North, or perhaps I do not know, but it has been in government for a significant period of time, yet it has chosen not to prioritise social welfare payments in the North. However, it believes it can be freely critical about a much more generous and supportive payment system in the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> We are transforming the social welfare system, but we are doing it in a way that is appropriate to Ireland. I have seen some of the changes that are being introduced in the North and in the United Kingdom and I would not be a fan of many of them. While Sinn Féin is very critical, which is fair enough, of everything Governments in the South have done, in the North it has not allocated any priority to the payment levels that are significantly below what is available here. It has a significant problem in the North, particularly with young men in both communities who leave school early and receive totally inadequate training opportunities. I am happy to listen to people's ideas but our intention here is to enormously enhance the training in work experience for young people. I taught young people at third level for a long time. People are emerging from that level with fantastic qualifications, but if they have no work experience their chances of getting a job when they go to a job interview are much reduced. We must shift the balance of our system to helping young people into education, training and ultimately into work, where they can become financially independent.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this Adjournment matter. It gives me no pleasure to raise this matter again and it is with a heavy heart and great regret that I do so. This is the third or fourth time I have raised this issue. One incident of flooding that affected the middle-eastern region, including Skibbereen, occurred when my party was in power. As the Minister of State present is probably aware and as the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will be aware, on 24 and 25 October Skibbereen was subject to flooding for the fifth time since 2009. It is an appalling vista that businesses, homeowners and elderly people have to be on nearly full-time alert when the flood waters rise. There was heavy rain from 6 p.m. on 24 October until 2 a.m on 25 October and Skibbereen was flooded from two sides. It was severely flooded from the Baltimore Road side and later when all the waters from the River Ilen estuary eventually hit Skibbereen it was flooded from the other side of town over by Marsh Road, Townsend Street etc. It would be remiss of me if I did not pay a huge tribute to all those in the services - the council, the local people, the Civil Defence, the gardaí and so on - who came out that night and did significant work to try to protect areas. Their input is sometimes forgotten. I am a ratepayer in Skibbereen and thankfully my place was not flooded. However, the vigilance of all those people and the text alerts that were sent out gave people a chance to get into businesses at 2 a.m. and shift boxes, perishable material, raise shelves and so on. Were it not for that, much more serious damage would have occurred in Skibbereen.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> I have raised an issue previously that has also impacted on other towns in the country that have been affected by flooding. Historically, there have been incidents of flooding in Fermoy, Mallow, Bandon and Clonakilty. Because of the extensive flooding that occurred in 2009 in Skibbereen the owners of the properties affected, be they commercial properties, pubs, shops, small businesses or those unfortunate people who live in flats or houses in low lying areas, can no longer get insurance. I am not sure how that serious issue can be resolved, but that is a matter for another day.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">I would like to make a point, without being too leadránach on this issue, about what has happened since the scheme was initially announced in 2010. Since it was first announced that Skibbereen needed a flood relief scheme, that project has been delayed by a year for some reason. I am not suggesting that the Minister or the Department involved made a concerted effort to put this on the long finger. Each of the first three phases of the scheme has been affected by a delay of three or four months. We are trying to sort out phase 3 at the moment. At the time of the initial announcement, the intention was that the scheme would start by January 2014, which is a couple of months away. I now understand that the scheme is not likely to start until November 2014, which is 12 months away. Many people in Skibbereen are worried about what will happen in the intervening period. These concerns are shared by people in many towns, but I am referring specifically to Skibbereen because it was badly affected by flooding over the Hallowe'en weekend.</p>
            <p eId="para_699"> I hope the Minister of State will have some positive news for the people of Skibbereen. The proactive flood relief committee that is up and running in the town is doing excellent work. Those involved - I will not mention any names - are very engaged with the Department and the OPW. Like the others I have mentioned, whom I cannot forget, they are doing great work. The patience of the people of Skibbereen and the surrounding area is wearing thin. I hope the Minister of State will have good news for me.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_700">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. A flood relief scheme for the town of Skibbereen is being advanced by Cork County Council, as the contracting authority, in partnership with the OPW, which is providing the funding. The development and progression of the scheme is being overseen by a steering committee with representatives of the council, the OPW and RPS, the engineering consultants for the scheme. A public exhibition of the preferred scheme proposals took place in April this year and lasted for four weeks. The main proposals of the scheme include the construction of new walls and embankments along the River Ilen and some of its tributaries in the town, new pumping stations, localised channel regrading and improvements to the local drainage system. Approximately 60 submissions were received from members of the public on the proposed scheme during the exhibition. Some of these submissions raised concerns over the levels of protection to be provided in certain areas, based on past experiences of local people. The OPW and Cork County Council recognise that local knowledge can make a valuable contribution to fine-tuning scheme proposals. Therefore, the consultants undertaking the study were asked to undertake further surveys and analysis to alleviate the concerns raised at the exhibition before a decision could be made regarding the next steps in taking the scheme forward. These surveys have now been completed and some changes have been made to the proposed scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> An exhibition report which will deal in depth with all the issues raised by each submission is expected to be completed soon. When that report has been received, responses will be issued by the OPW to all parties who made submissions. The OPW, in consultation with the council, will decide on the appropriateness of moving forward with the project as proposed. It is expected that the scheme will be moved to detailed design once the responses are issued. It is envisaged that the detailed design process will commence before the end of November. It is hoped to complete that process, and the process of procuring a civil works contractor, by the middle of next year. This would allow construction to commence in the third quarter of 2014. To mitigate delays on the scheme, the OPW and Cork County Council agreed earlier this year to bring forward the site investigation works in advance of the detailed design process. These works, which commenced in September, are due for completion in December. This will greatly aid the progression of the detailed design.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> The OPW's consultants and staff from Cork County Council have been on the ground collecting data from the flood event which occurred on 24 and 25 October. When all the data have been collected, they will need to be analysed. While it is possible that the analysis will identify issues that will necessitate some modification of the proposals, early indications suggest that no significant changes to the scheme will be required. While it is unfortunate for the town to experience this latest flooding event, the data collected should bring some additional certainty regarding the robustness of the proposed scheme that will be undertaken in the coming years. I am pleased to confirm that the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing a scheme in Skibbereen in its financial profiles for the 2014-16 period. I look forward to the works commencing towards the end of next year. I sympathise with what Senator O'Donovan has said about the hardship this has caused to the people of Skibbereen. As I come from Mallow and also represent Fermoy and Midleton, I am fully cognisant of the flooding issues local people have had to endure in the absence of a flood relief scheme. I assure the Senator that Skibbereen will benefit from the scheme as soon as work on it commences. Mallow has ceased to have instances of flooding, with the exception of the Park Road area, which does not have any residents. These schemes have been quite successful. I look forward to a successful resolution of this issue also.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I will be brief. I thank the Minister of State. I accept that the council and the OPW are probably doing the best they can. I will continue to hold a watching brief in this regard, even if I will not be able to keep as close an eye on the matter as the Skibbereen flood committee and the others who are working to allay these difficulties. The Minister of State can relay that message to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, whom I know very well. I raised my concerns about this issue with Dr. Martin Mansergh when he was the Minister of State responsible. I will continue to raise them. While I do not want to do so <i>ad nauseam</i>, I will highlight these matters again before next summer in order that we can ensure there is no more flooding at the end of next year. Of course, there is no guarantee that we will not have more flooding between now and 1 April 2014. I hope that will not happen for the sake of the people of Skibbereen, who deserve better. As I have said, I will be holding a watching brief. Like the Skibbereen eagle, I will keep my eye on the matter to ensure fair play is achieved. There must be no further delays with regard to this scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_705">Ba bhreá liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. As the Minister of State is well aware, the credit union movement across the country is facing many issues and challenges. I am concerned about the proposal to combine the community credit unions in Naas and Newbridge. I have particular worries about the management of this proposal and the precedent it might set for the credit union movement across the country, which is a great community movement. The community in Newbridge has been left in a very uncertain position over the last 23 months, since a special manager was appointed to Newbridge credit union on foot of certain developments within that institution. There seems to have been a distinct lack of consultation with the community. It is time for the community to get answers to certain questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> I would like to put some specific questions to the Minister of State and would be grateful if I could get answers to each of them. Is there a plan B in the event of the failure of the proposed combination of Newbridge and Naas credit unions? Does the Minister for Finance have other options in place or lined up in the event of the proposed combination failing? Is he open to the recovery plan that has been proposed by people in Newbridge as an alternative? As the Minister of State knows, there is resistance and considerable concern about the proposed merger of the credit unions. What has the special manager achieved for the people of Newbridge and their credit union in the last 23 months? How much has the special manager cost Newbridge credit union at this stage? There is no need for me to labour the issues. This is a matter of considerable concern for the people of Newbridge and for people across the country whose credit unions face particular challenges relating to reserves, etc. I would be very grateful for some specific answers.</p>

            <p eId="para_707">The Central Bank is responsible for the regulation and supervision of credit unions. That role includes the implementation of resolution action under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, where required. On 13 January 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland secured a High Court order for the appointment of a special manager to Newbridge Credit Union. Further High Court applications were made to extend the term of appointment of the special manager, the latest being in June 2013. High Court orders were secured for a six-month extension period on each occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The special manager appointment was made because of Central Bank concerns about the high level of loan losses incurred by the credit union which impacted on the level of its reserves. There were also concerns about some of the lending made, which went beyond the traditional type of lending normally provided by credit unions. The extent of the problems at Newbridge means that it is not sustainable for it to continue as a stand-alone entity. As a resolution case with financial difficulties and viability concerns, it also does not meet the statutory conditions for stabilisation support. The Central Bank undertook a process under the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 involving the examination of possible combinations with other credit unions. It is in the context of this process that the Naas proposal came on to the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> It is important to set out the Minister's role in this process. The Central Bank has the statutory role of "resolution authority" under the 2011 Act. The role of the Minister under this process is essentially twofold. First, consultation with the Minister is a requirement under the intervention conditions. This means that the Minister was consulted in respect of the special management order and the associated extensions but does not provide for the Minister to have a decision-making role or a veto. The Minister would also be a consultee in respect of any proposed transfer order. Second, in the event that the Governor of the Central Bank requests the payment of an incentive for a transfer, the Minister's approval is needed for the Central Bank to provide that financial incentive from the resolution fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Senators will appreciate that, notwithstanding the extent of media coverage on the situation, the Central Bank process remains subject to strict confidentiality requirements under the High Court order and the Act. That confidentiality restriction applies equally to the Minister as it does to other parties and, therefore, there is a limit to what the Minister is permitted to say on the matter. However, I want to take the opportunity to emphasise once again that the Minister's core objective is to ensure that members' savings are protected notwithstanding the extent of the very real problems of Newbridge Credit Union. This will be the first case where the taxpayer is being called upon to cover the losses at a credit union and to ensure that members' savings will be protected. The money will come from the resolution fund to which the Government has contributed €250 million of taxpayers' money, which is recoupable over time from credit institutions via a levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The Minister is fully aware of the strength of feeling locally about the situation at Newbridge Credit Union, which has also been raised by public representatives in recent months. The Minister met the Newbridge Action Group on 19 September to hear its concerns about the process and to afford the group an opportunity to outline its alternative proposals. Following that meeting, the agreed next steps were for the Newbridge Action Group to submit its proposal to the Minister expeditiously. As agreed at the meeting with the action group, on receipt of its alternative proposal, the Minister forwarded it to Professor Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank, with a view to a meeting between the Central Bank and the action group. This is now a matter for the Central Bank and I understand the meeting with the group took place last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_712"> The Central Bank continues to work under the provisions of the High Court Order and the Act to bring a conclusion to the intervention at Newbridge. The focus of the Minister in his limited role under the Act is to secure the protection of members' savings and he had encouraged the Central Bank to progress this issue with a view to an expeditious conclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I appreciate what he says about the limitations on the Minister's role. The fact remains that there is considerable disquiet. The central question, which has still to be answered, is what will happen if the proposed merger of the two credit unions fails. There are reports of an increase in loan sharks in Newbridge. People are worried about their savings across the country. I hear what the Minister of State says about the fund that is available to guarantee people's savings, which is the most important thing. However, people feel that the Central Bank wields unaccountable power without sufficient consultation. These credit unions have, after all, been built up by communities across the country and it is probably time that people heard about what is going to happen in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">Often, politicians and journalists do not agree. That can often happen for valid reasons on both sides. Journalists can be overly critical of politicians at times, sometimes unfairly so. Martin Breheny from the <i>Irish Independent</i> is a journalist for whom I have high regard. Most of the time, he reports on sport and does a very good job. His article last Wednesday was particularly damning of the inaction of politicians in dealing with a situation which has manifested itself with the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI. These associations have been hit with rates bills of the order of millions. I attended a briefing on job creation in sport which was also attended by the general secretary of the GAA, Páraic Duffy, the president of the FAI, John Delaney, and others. The figure for Croke Park has risen from €600,000 to €1.5 million. The figure is similar for the Aviva Stadium. That is totally ridiculous and unacceptable. It reflects a lack of political will to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> The GAA is an amateur organisation. It is appalling to think that there will be a €1 million euro annual increase in its rates bill for Croke Park. This must be dealt with urgently and the uncertainty surrounding the issue must be cleared up by Government. It has been dragging on for a number of weeks. It was brought to my attention at that briefing which took place about seven or eight weeks ago. I agree with everything Martin Breheny said in his article last week. Letters from senior Ministers to other Ministers are frankly a joke. It is not that they do not meet each other. They meet each other every day of the week. The uncertainty felt at the headquarters of the GAA will percolate down to other clubs which have members' bars and which will be hit with this astronomical increase in rates. </p>
            <p eId="para_716"> I am from County Clare which had a very positive experience in Croke Park this year. There are many other counties that have won All-Ireland championships and had positive experiences in Croke Park. Croke Park is a major income generator for north County Dublin and the entire city of Dublin on several weekends during the year. It does not just relate to All-Ireland football and hurling finals but semi-finals, quarter finals, Leinster finals and concerts. There were a number of events last year relating to the Eucharistic Congress when it was here. It is appalling to think that a voluntary sports organisation like the GAA is facing this type of financial uncertainty. It is not acceptable for a Government that prides itself on promoting sport and that has done much to promote sport to allow this type of uncertainty to continue. I raise issues on the Adjournment on a regular basis and I know the standard answer. It is no disrespect to the Minister of State with responsibility for small business who is here. I saw the response that Deputy John O'Mahony received when he raised this matter during a Topical Issue debate in the Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">I sincerely hope that is not the type of response I am going to get tonight. If it is, I will be encouraging the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, who is an excellent Minister of State, to take the matter on and deal with it, because it is simply shameful that voluntary organisations are faced with this type of financial uncertainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">Like Clare, Sligo may not have had positive experiences in Croke Park but the county certainly had them last week in the Aviva Stadium. I congratulate Sligo Rovers on winning the FAI Cup. We are very fortunate to have in the GAA headquarters one of the finest stadiums in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches, golf course lands, tennis courts, etc. In accordance with this provision, all playing pitches are exempt from rates. The Act also provides that community halls such as sports clubhouses which are not licensed to sell alcohol and the facilities of which are not used primarily for profit or gain, are not rateable. Again, this allows for the exemption of most sports club premises throughout the country. The vast majority of sports facilities throughout the State are therefore rates-free. However, the Act specifically provides that where a club is licensed to sell alcohol and is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, it is no longer deemed to be a community hall and therefore the premises occupied by that club are rateable. The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and licensed club premises are competing with other licensed premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> The Valuation Office, as part of its revaluation programme, is in the process of updating the valuation of all commercial properties. The revaluation has been completed and is effective for rates purposes in the local authority areas of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The revaluation of Dublin city and the three rating authorities in Waterford is nearing completion and proposed valuation certificates have been issued in these areas. Final valuation certificates for rateable properties in these four local authorities will issue in December 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> At this time it is only the revaluation process that is likely to give rise to increases in rates for sports clubs since the local authorities, in order to assist business in as much as they can, have not increased their ARV, annual rate on valuation, in recent years. For Dublin city and Waterford the valuations proposed are not yet in the public domain and at this stage are a matter between the occupier of the property and the Commissioner of Valuation. Before the valuations are published the occupier can make representations to the commissioner and after publication appeals against a valuation can be lodged. Any increase in rates as a result of the revaluation process will be because it reflects a relative increase in value of a property when compared to all other rateable premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> This assessment of relative value is completed by the Commissioner of Valuation on an independent basis. The revaluation programme will update the values on which rates are based to reflect modern values. As it currently stands rates in areas that have not been revalued are based on values and relativities that persisted in 1998 or much earlier. The revaluation programme will ensure that rates are levied on a more equitable basis. Any concession that might be considered for the category of property is likely to erode the equity in the system. First, any concession to one category of property would have to be passed on to the occupiers of all other rateable valuations. Local authorities calculate the ARV on the basis of the aggregate value on their valuation list. Second, many sports clubs with a bar are in competition with other licensed premises which also pay rates. This would further increase the inequity of a concession.</p>
            <p eId="para_723"> If a property is rateable then it is the commissioner who determines its value and he is completely independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001. The making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative. I am informed by the commissioner that for sports clubs the playing area is not included in the valuation calculation. The Act does not prescribe any particular method of valuation for a particular class or use of property. However, equity and uniformity of approach are key valuation principles and it would be unfair to statutorily prescribe a method of valuation that advantaged or disadvantaged one ratepayer or class of ratepayers over another.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> The values determined and the methods used to determine values can be the subject of representations from the ratepayer, appeal to the commissioner, appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and to the courts. The practices used and the values determined are, therefore, continuously tested. I believe the current system, which exempts a high percentage of sports facilities, achieves a balance between the interests of sports clubs and the broader ratepayer base.</p>

            <p eId="para_725">I do not accept that for one minute. That is a typical civil servant systems-driven answer. The question of fairness and equity and all such methodology used throughout the prepared script that the Minister of State has delivered flies in the face of voluntary sports groups. These organisations may very well use a bar and a licensed premises to fund what are totally under-funded bodies when it comes to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> I am only a Senator and unfortunately I do not have the power to resolve this, but I appeal to the people who are leading the Government and who have the power to resolve it to deal with it. The answer provided is simply not acceptable and I know that if I was discussing the matter with the Minister of State privately, he would tell me it was not acceptable also. This issue must be dealt with. The sports people of Ireland are expecting leadership on this matter and so am I.</p>

            <p eId="para_727">I respect the Senator's view. However, most sports facilities are exempt from rates. Those liable for rates because they have a bar are in competition with other licensed premises. From that point of view, we should consider the investment, the opportunity and the valuation of commercial operations. Let us suppose a person is joining a sports complex that is paying rates or let us suppose someone is in a facility. Then perhaps there should be a consideration of fairness with regard to how that operates. The valuation of a sports complex applies only to the licensed area, not the whole complex. Perhaps with arbitration it may not be as dire as the Senator has indicated. If rates are going to increase, it is most likely to be in the areas that are being revalued and the revaluation programme is bringing greater equity into the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_728"> The Commissioner of Valuation has the expertise in this area and he is completely independent from the Minister in the exercise of his functions. The determination of the value he makes can be challenged and tested through an extensive representation and appeals process. Achieving a balance is important in this as in other areas. Many clubs have charitable status as well and, therefore, may not be liable for taxation from the point of view of the profits. It is always difficult but I believe the current system strikes a fair balance between the sometimes competing interests of sports clubs and the wider ratepayer base. Having said that, I respect what the Senator has said and I will convey his concerns to the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">I suppose the medals the players won will probably go down as collectors items because it will be the only time in the history of the League of Ireland that "Silgo" Rovers will have won a cup final. That is worth noting.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> I wish to ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to outline a specific timeframe pertaining to the introduction of collective bargaining legislation and to clarify for the House whether mandatory trade union recognition is likely to be included in a legislative framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> The Government committed in the programme for Government to bringing in such legislation. The programme for Government has a commitment to reform the current law on employee's rights to engage in collective bargaining and the current Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. We are two and half years into government and while the commitment has been in the programme for Government we still have not seen the colour of the legislation. We are required under a European court decision to bring forward this legislation. In recent times we have seen several debates on the matter in this and the Lower House. The tenor of those debates held that some discussions and consultations have to be held with both sides, meaning the trade union movement and the employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">Based on a recent reply given in the Lower House, those consultations have concluded and an indication was given that the legislation would be brought forward in November. This is the first week of November. When will the legislation be published? Will it give recognition to employees to be members of trade unions? In this, the centenary of the 1913 Lock-out, it would be most appropriate and proper that this legislation would be published to pay tribute to the memory of Jim Larkin and others like him. I would like the Bill to be published this year and I hope the Minister of State will give a favourable response.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_735">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. It has been the consistent policy of successive Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association. There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process. The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> Furthermore, Article 40 of the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions. It has been established in a number of legal cases, however, that the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association does not guarantee workers the right to have their union recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining. The 2007 decision of the Supreme Court in Ryanair <i>v</i>. the Labour Court cast doubt on the mechanism that had been established in the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004, to resolve problems between employers and workers regarding to terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> Prior to the outcome of the Ryanair Supreme Court case, the original legislative arrangements had been seen as a workable compromise. The legislative model for resolving issues relating to employee representation had reflected a shared commitment that, where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences which arise between employers and trade unions representing employees is by voluntary collective bargaining. In the absence of a practice of voluntary collective bargaining, subject to agreed qualifying criteria, the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004 provided a mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality could be assessed. The Towards 2016 transitional agreement of 2008 under social partnership contained a commitment to establish a review process to consider the legal and other steps necessary to enable the employee representation mechanisms that had been established under previous agreements and in legislation to operate as they had been intended. The agreement also provided for a commitment to bring forward legislative proposals to prohibit the victimisation of trade union members and to prohibit the incentivisation of persons not to be members of a trade union. The review process did not result in substantive progress being made on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> There is a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure Irish law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining - the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 - is consistent with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR. Acting on the commitment has required consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts 2001 and 2004, and the consequences of the litigation that has arisen in the operation of these Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> With this in mind, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wrote to relevant stakeholders inviting their observations on the matter. Submissions were subsequently received and a series of initial first step meetings took place between departmental officials and stakeholders in mid-2013. Discussions with stakeholders are ongoing. It is the Minister's intention to update the Government on progress in this regard in the near future. The established dispute settling institutions should continue to play an important role in disputes over trade union recognition. The established procedures can be improved and secured without introducing a mandatory requirement on employers to recognise trade unions for collective bargaining purposes. The Minister hopes to put proposals on the issue to the Cabinet shortly. With regard to the programme for Government commitment, I am certain satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that are suited to our constitutional, social and economic traditions as well as our international obligations. I am also convinced that they can be framed to ensure continued success in attracting investment into our economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. A number of Members in both Houses have raised this issue repeatedly since the beginning of the year. We are trundling along slowly but we seem to be getting there. The Minister of State referred to "the near future" and proposals on the issue going to the Cabinet soon. Will he clarify what these references mean? Does it mean before the end of November or will it be December? It is important that the matter be dealt with in 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">The Government is committed to exploring the differences between the employer and trade unions perspectives on the issue of employee representation through a process of dialogue. A number of complex issues are involved, including the experience of the operation of the legislative framework put in place under the Industrial Relations 2001, the consequences of the litigation that has arisen in the operation of these Acts and the implications of relevant ECHR ratings. The process will necessarily have regard to a number of issues, including the legal advice on the ECHR judgments, the definition of what constitutes collective bargaining, the concept of an exceptional body, providing protection for employers in terms of victimisation for membership activities on behalf of trade unions, addressing the issue of incentivisation of workers to induce employers to surrender important trade union rights. I am hopeful that through a similar co-operative approach a pragmatic and workable solution to the differences on the issue of employee representation can be found.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> In 2010 the ICTU, acting on behalf of the airline pilots in Ryanair, submitted a complaint to the ILO committee on the freedom of association that Ireland was not in conformity with provisions of the ILO Convention No. 98, the right to organise and collective bargaining. The complaint involved allegations of anti-union discrimination. The ILO committee on freedom of association considered the submission and this is the backdrop to the issue. The Minister has stated clearly he is committed to going to the Cabinet shortly with his recommendations following the consultation that has taken place. I am confident there will be a clear position from him on what he will do on this issue before year end.</p>
