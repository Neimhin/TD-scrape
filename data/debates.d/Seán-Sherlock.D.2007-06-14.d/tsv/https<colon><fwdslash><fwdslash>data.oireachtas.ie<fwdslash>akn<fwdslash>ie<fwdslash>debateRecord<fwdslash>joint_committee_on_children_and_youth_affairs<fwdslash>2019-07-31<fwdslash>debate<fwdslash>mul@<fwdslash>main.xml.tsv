[<p eid="para_95">Tusla would prosecute in the event that a service is unregulated.</p>]
[<p eid="para_208">I welcome the witnesses before us today. I want to start by saying that I have much sympathy for the predicament that parents find themselves in at present, particularly those parents whose children are attending some of these facilities as we speak and who are absolutely and utterly conflicted about sending their children to these facilities but have no other choice other than to go back to these facilities because they have no alternative arrangements. Such parents seek clarity from us as to whether the interactions we are having today will provide some degree of confidence to those parents. As a parent, if my child were in any of those facilities and I had no choice but to send my child there, I would be racked with guilt, feeling ambivalent about what I should be doing and I know for a fact that some of the children have been withdrawn from such facilities because I have been talking to some of the parents of those children. I am not sure I have heard anything today that would give me crumbs of confidence or give those parents grounds for confidence. I wanted to make that point at the very start.</p>, <p eid="para_209"> Correct me if I am wrong, but everything I have heard today points back to Tusla saying it is reverting to Children First guidelines. Earlier, the acting chief executive stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_210">It is important to state in the clearest terms possible, however, that Tusla’s early years inspectorate had no evidence of the serious child protection concerns or the high degree of serious non-compliance with standards that was shown in the RTÉ programme. Indeed, the behaviours displayed are unlikely ever to be evident during an inspection and we rely on good governance practice and appropriate mandatory reporting under Children First or through Tusla’s unsolicited information office for the notification of child protection concerns.</p>, <p eid="para_211">To parse the language, Mr. Smyth was saying that if people do not report child protection concerns to Tusla within the facilities themselves, as childcare workers, Tusla has no way of knowing what is going on. Is that correct?</p>]
[<p eid="para_213">I want straight answers from Mr. Smyth, please.</p>]
[<p eid="para_215">I appreciate that and we have been through that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_217">I appreciate all of that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_219">My time is limited. I do not want to be ambiguous, I want clear answers. Mr. Smyth is saying that if the Children First and mandatory reporting guidelines are not being adhered to by the staff on the ground in the facility, if they are not compliant, then Tusla has no way of knowing what is going on outside of the inspections that it carries out. Is that correct? Please answer "Yes" or "No".</p>]
[<p eid="para_221">That is what we are talking about.</p>]
[<p eid="para_223">On that basis, it is reasonable to objectively say that the regulatory regime is not working comprehensively in a way that ensures that a parent can have absolute confidence that the misbehaviour, putting it mildly, that we saw in that programme is dealt with. There is absolutely no guarantee for any parent, across the country, that the regulatory and inspectorate regime can move across or cover those types of eventualities. I am making a point.</p>, <p eid="para_224"> I again go back to Mr. Smyth's submission. Hyde and Seek has been on the radar of Tusla for quite some time and Mr. Smyth has clearly articulated that to us today. Did he ever look at the culture that existed within Hyde and Seek? Was he ever concerned about the management structure of Hyde and Seek such that it might be difficult for an individual childcare worker, if he or she had concerns, to find a mechanism to air those concerns in a way that would ensure that they would be protected, short of making a protected disclosure or going to Tusla's-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_226">-----unsolicited information office?</p>, <p eid="para_227">My fear is for junior staff who might be afraid, if a particular regime existed, to make known their concerns because of the potential repercussions that might be visited upon them if they made a complaint. It happens across business and in the public and private sectors. Is there a flaw in the inspectorate regime if it does not pick up on those type of conflicts when talking to staff during inspections?</p>]
[<p eid="para_230">When?</p>]
[<p eid="para_232">Was that through the prism of RTÉ?</p>]
[<p eid="para_234">When?</p>]
[<p eid="para_236">The timelines here are very important, Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_239">What does Tusla say to parents-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_243">Nobody is suggesting that the vast bulk of facilities are beyond reproach. Let us nail that to the mast. That is self-evident because we have relationships in our constituencies with childcare facilities and they are excellent. I have a lot of sympathy for what I would call junior staff, as opposed to management staff, who are working under duress in some instances in these facilities. However, there is a systemic failure somewhere because if there was not, we would not be sitting here today and we would not have witnessed the scenes we witnessed on the RTÉ programme. What I am trying to do is nail down where the obligations lie. There are obligations regarding mandatory reporting and there seems to have been a failure somewhere in that respect and we need to address that failure. Similarly, parents listening to this discussion will hear some sympathetic language about improving the quality of the conversation with parents and involving them more in respect of policy and so on. However, if a parent who sent his or her child to one of these creches today had an inkling that something was going on, he or she will not go to the Tusla website or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs website to check the criteria. They would not necessarily act on their instinct because they have trust that the regulatory regime is robust enough to ensure their child is protected. That is a failure in the system. As mentioned by other speakers, we need to get to a point now, arising from this episode, where parents are given power on a statutory basis to be part of a communications set-up, so to speak, with whatever facility their child happens to be in or attending in a way that ensures there is proper communication with them because they are being left out of the loop. I repeat that parents are racked with guilt. I am a parent. I was racked with guilt watching that programme. One could not but be racked with guilt. Parents already feel guilty sending their children to childcare daily, given the society we live in where the two parents have to work. We will have an opportunity to address and engage with the academics about whom Ms McNally spoke because it is our intention to have a second committee hearing, for which I thank the Chairman, to which those academics will be invited because it is important that we kick the tyres, so to speak, in respect of what the witnesses are telling us and have a robust discussion. We will need to hear from parents also in respect of what we are hearing today.</p>, <p eid="para_244"> I want to drill down into the programme. Obviously, the people working undercover made representations, disclosures or notified Tusla. I am concerned that too much time elapsed between the notification by those undercover workers and the lack of communication with parents such that some parents were not notified other than via RTÉ. Nobody is blaming RTÉ. It has done a public service on this issue. However, the parents want to know why Tusla did not phone them to notify them this was going on and if they could be given a guarantee that their child will be safe in the intervening period. That is the bottom line.</p>]
[<p eid="para_246">Mr. Lee said that already. Let me be clear. When an-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_249">What I want clarified is when the undercover reporters-workers notified Tusla of their concerns, aside from RTÉ, as a corporate body, writing to Tusla.</p>]
[<p eid="para_254">In the period from April to July there were children in a facility who could have been subjected to the behaviours we have witnessed and who could have been at risk.</p>]
[<p eid="para_257">I am treading very carefully. There is the law and there are the regulations but then there is right and wrong. From the point of view of what is right and wrong, no matter what the law states, if one is in receipt of information in April, one should not take the bureaucratic path.</p>]
[<p eid="para_261">I have two final points.</p>]
[<p eid="para_263">I would like to take the same amount of time as the Chairman took.</p>]
[<p eid="para_265">We need to create a culture in which there is adequate parental representation, because parents need to have a voice in all of this. Access for parents via CCTV or apps has to be looked at. Is there a requirement on the manager and owner of a crèche or child care facility, who also works in the crèche, to have all the necessary qualifications?</p>]
[<p eid="para_267">I also put a question on management.</p>]
[<p eid="para_269">Can Tusla take special measures, short of closing a facility, if it needs to do so in cases of a failure of management?</p>]
[<p eid="para_271">That needs to be looked at.</p>]
