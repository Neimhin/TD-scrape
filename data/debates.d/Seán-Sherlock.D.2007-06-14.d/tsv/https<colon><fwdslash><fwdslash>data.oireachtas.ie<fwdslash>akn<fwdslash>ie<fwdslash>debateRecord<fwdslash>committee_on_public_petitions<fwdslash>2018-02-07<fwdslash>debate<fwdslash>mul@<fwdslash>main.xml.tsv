SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T13:30:00+00:00	Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Dara Murphy and Senator Collette Kelleher. The usual rules apply regarding mobile telephones. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T13:50:00+00:00	The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00041/17 on the reinstatement of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme overage exemption for children with special needs. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0003/18, which proposes, to use the words of the petitioner, "to bring Irish hospitals up to an acceptable European standard". The decision of the committee is to deem the petition inadmissible and close the petition under Standing Order 111C(2)(a). Is that agreed? Agreed.  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00044/17 on ending the Irish arms trade with Israel. The reply from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade addresses the issues raised by the petitioner. It states that Ireland does not have an arms industry and is not an exporter of weapons to any country. The purchase of arms, it continues, is subject to a tendering process, the principal criterion being the best equipment that can be obtained for the protection and operational effectiveness of Irish troops. In that regard, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T13:50:00+00:00	The proposal is to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner. In doing so, the committee recognises and respects the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration has been the subject of some public discourse in the past 48 hours. Petition No. P00026/17 from Ms Aideen Darmody seeks the removal of the statue of Prince Albert from the grounds of Leinster House on the basis that it pays tribute to a monarch whose values are in opposition to those of the Irish Republic. The petitioner suggests that the statue be auctioned and the proceeds donated to a homeless charity.We have received correspondence from the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas stating that the Houses do not own the statue of Prince Albert and that information on its ownership can be supplied by the Office of Public Works art management unit. The physical implications and potential cost of removing the statue would also be best answered by the OPW. The statue dates back to the Royal Dublin Society's ownership of Leinster House. It is worth noting that the sculpture was done by John H. Foley, who was a renowned sculptor. The proposal before us is to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(a) because it is asking the DÃ¡il to do something that it does not have the power to do. When we discussed this in private session, the view was that the committee does not wish to have the statue removed, that it should remain but that it would be pertinent to seek clarification from the OPW or the powers that be as to who owns the statue. However, I wish to have a discussion and will seek members' views.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T14:00:00+00:00	I thank the members for sharing their views. It is the view of the committee that the statue should remain. From a technical point of view the petition is deemed inadmissible because it is asking us to do something we do not have the power to do. However, it is an interesting one. Deputy Mitchell is right. Sometimes there is an eclectic range of petitions before us and we are respectful to the petitioners but there is a clear view in this case that, as the emeritus professor of history at University College Cork, John A. Murphy, said when quoting from George Santayana, a philosopher poet, a civilised people does not tear out the pages of history, it simply turns them over. We acknowledge the presence of the statue and that it is symbolic. However, the artistic merit attributed to the statue given that it is the work of John H. Foley probably supersedes the statue's subject. We are clear on our position and I thank the petitioner for-----
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T14:00:00+00:00	To be helpful, perhaps we should establish the ownership in the first instance.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T14:00:00+00:00	We have agreed to correspond with the OPW on that. Perhaps we can discuss it when a response is received.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-02-07T14:00:00+00:00	To respond to Deputy Mitchell's earlier point, I have been going through that gate for ten years. One passes the statue by and does not take much notice of it, to be honest. Like the Deputy, I had to go out the other day to take a look at it to see who it was and so forth. It took me a while to find it. It is quite an imposing structure but it is hidden by the hedge. I would not necessarily opt for relocating it.If, however, some treatment can be done in or around the location of the statue by the OPW or the internal management of the Houses, that might be the way to proceed. I thank the members for their agreement on this issue and I again thank the petitioner. A decision has been made. Is that agreed? Agreed. As there is no further business, the meeting is adjourned until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 2017.
