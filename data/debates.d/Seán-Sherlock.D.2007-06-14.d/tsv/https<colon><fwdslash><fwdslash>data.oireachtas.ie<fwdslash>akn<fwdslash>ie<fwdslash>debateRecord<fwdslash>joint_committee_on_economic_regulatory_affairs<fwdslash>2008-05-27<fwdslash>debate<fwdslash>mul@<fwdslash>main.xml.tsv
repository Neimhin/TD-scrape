SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome Mr. Callaghan's presentation on behalf of Ryanair.  I am trying to get a read on the issue from the point of view of how it impacts on the end user, the customer at the airport.  We are hearing numerous costings for Terminal 2.  The question is whether the charges being imposed by the regulator are being imposed in a manner that seeks to meet the cost of the new terminal.  If that is the case, what is the true cost of T2?  When Mr. Guiomard appeared before the committee he mentioned a figure of €1.2 billion.  The Dublin Airport Authority states the cost will be in the region of €395 million at current prices and Ryanair has its own figures on this.  What is the true picture as regards the pricing mechanism of the cost of the terminal?  With regard to RAB, the regulated asset base, what is the alternative model of costing in that sense?  I am a layman and I am seeking to broaden my understanding of the issues.  If we had a different model would it be more efficient?  What does Ryanair think is the more efficient model?   What are the powers of this committee to question until we get to the bottom of what is quite a confusing issue? I am not completely convinced the regulator is acting in the best interests of the consumer.  I am not convinced that it is an openly competitive model, but I cannot explain the reason for not being convinced.  I need further information.  Perhaps it was naivety and lack of understanding on my part, but when the Commission for Aviation Regulation was here it give us a rose-tinted view of matters.  I called specifically for Ryanair to attend today to obtain another point of view and then we could recall the Regulator so that we can see the true picture.  I am not convinced the cost model that pertains to Terminal 2 is necessarily the correct one.  As a Corkman who finds it necessary to use Dublin Airport every time I go to Dublin, I do so reluctantly because of the sheer hassle one must go through and the charging structures that apply to everything one does from the time one parks one's car to when one boards the plane.  Perhaps the aviation regulator should be brought to book in regard to some of these charges that are applied to consumers, to whom we have ultimate responsibility.I do not know whether it is appropriate to ask, but would it be possible for Mr. Callaghan to expand on his views in regard to the servicing of debt vis-à-vis Cork Airport and the future of that airport.  Is Ryanair’s potential involvement in Cork Airport hindered by virtue of the debt the airport is saddled with and the cost structures that arise as a result of that debt?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will come in on the second round.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Mr. Callaghan for those answers.  We need to distinguish between discretionary and airport charges.  I have flown to far flung places with Ryanair.  I slept on the floor of Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, not a very comfortable place to sleep, while awaiting a transfer to Ciampino to watch Ireland play Italy in the Six Nations Championship.  However, had I travelled with Alitalia or Aer Lingus, I would have paid through the nose for the privilege.There are many customers who will take whatever steps are necessary to reach their final destination, including, if they must, sleeping on an uncomfortable airport floor.  The argument is not about the extra charges Ryanair imposes.  The bottom line is to pack a smaller bag.  Most people I know travel at weekends and can simply put their bags in the overhead locker.  We must distinguish between that charge and those levied by airports on consumers.  That is the point.I do not wish to harp on about the cost of Terminal 2 but who will its end users be?  Who will pay for it?  If Ryanair or any other airline will not use it, will they have to pay for it?  Will it be the taxpayer who will ultimately pay for it?  Who will be the net beneficiaries when it is completed?  This issue must be hammered out.  If I have learned anything today, it is that more questions must be asked of the regulator who must be brought back to address the points outlined in the submission.
