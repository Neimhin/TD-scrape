SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is to do with legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will get the same answer that Deputy Michael Creed got.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is clear from the earlier reply to Deputy Michael Creed that the Minister will not budge on this issue.  Today, a recently widowed lady contacted me whose son wishes to take over the family farm holding.  He would have been an ideal applicant for these two schemes.  However, as they were going through a process of grant of probate, he was not in a position to send his application before 14 October.  The legal instrument went against him and took longer than anticipated.  Will the Minister allow for some degree of discretion and fairness for those who were in the process of applying?  On 14 October the two schemes were cut down in one fell swoop without any notice period.  That did not allow individuals, such as those I have just mentioned, to have some fairness in submitting their applications.  If they had some notice, they might have come into the scheme.  Cutting the schemes off on 14 October was the wrong way to go about it.  Will the Minister revisit his decisions for the sake of equity and fairness?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Nobody questions the validity of the scheme or its success.  We all agree that Government policy has been sound in this regard.  What we are asking for is some degree of discretion.  There should be an extension beyond 14 October to allow these people to make their applications.  There must be some degree of flexibility on this issue.  As has already been said, those people who were on the point of making their applications had a reasonable expectation, because they had gone through the process of applying, that they would be within the timeframe.  The Minister has carried out a miserly and mean-spirited act towards those who set out in good faith to participate in the scheme.  It is a sad indictment of current Government policy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister should tell that to the widow I mentioned.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The original question was based on the premise that budgetary cuts have been applied across the board in the agriculture sector.  This is the only opportunity available to me to highlight some of those cuts.  For example, investment in research and training has decreased by 13%.  Similar reductions have been applied in areas like food safety, health and welfare, plant health, income and market supports and income supports for disadvantaged areas.  When one examines the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's entire programme of expenditure, one has to conclude that the Government's ability to implement the programme for Government is seriously hampered.  Those of us responsible for the agriculture brief have not been given any legislation to consider since the last election.  When will the animal welfare Bill be published, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government?  The extensive consultation period in that regard does not seem to have come to a conclusion.  On what date will it be concluded?  I would also like to ask about the proposed establishment of an all-Ireland GM-free zone.  When does the Department envisage that this process will be concluded and this policy will be implemented?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When does the Minister envisage that the target of dedicating 5% of acreage to organic farmland will be reached?  The European Commission recently announced that it does not envisage that mandatory country of origin labelling will be introduced.  The programme for Government states that mandatory country of origin food labelling will be extended to sheep, pig and poultry meat.  Will that measure be implemented?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the modulation issue, I am reassured to a certain extent by the Minister's statement on the move from pillar one to pillar two.  Is there a political appetite in the Council of Ministers for the rate of change from pillar 1 to pillar 2 as envisaged by the Commission proposal?  My second question is on climate change proposals.  There is a view that the basis of measurement of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is predicated on a faulty methodology.  Will the Minister examine that methodology and request an independent, scientific analysis of it?  It will have far-reaching effects on Irish agriculture and that is the reason for my question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is clear that there are still issues of concern relating to Brazilian beef.  While I welcome the Minister of State's reply and acknowledge that beef exports from Brazil are confined to a small number of herds, the amounts within those herds would probably far outweigh the Irish national herd.  The numbers in question are still significant.I welcome the Minister of State's reply and accept that the Department has chosen the correct course of action in the circumstances.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Am I to take it that the answer is the same as that given for Question No. 8?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to ask a supplementary question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will take the answer as read but I wish to state that money is being taken out of farmers' real income here.  Some of the measures that have been implemented in this budget, including this one, will bring about a further demise in agricultural productivity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Department has ridden roughshod over some of those programmes since then.  The Minister is being very selective, with all due respect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The farm waste management scheme is a result of obligations under European Commission rules which had to be implemented.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	These measures will further undermine the rural economy and that is the bottom line.
