[<p eid="para_10">I have two lists of amendments, one dated 5 April and the other dated 31 March. To ensure that I am singing off the same hymn sheet as everyone else, is the 5 April list the updated one?</p>]
[<p eid="para_12">I thank the Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_23">I am sorry for intervening at this stage but there are more than 80 amendments and I am conscious of the time. My understanding of the Chairman's earlier intervention is that sections 26 and 27 may be pertinent with regard to Members of the Oireachtas. Rather than explaining all of the sections at this stage, could we move to deal with the amendments, extrapolate their meaning and dispense with them as we go along? Obviously, I will be guided by the Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">The standards commissioner, as I understand it, will be able to appoint - a board will be appointed, if I am not mistaken. May I seek a clarification on that? It would be necessary in my view to ensure that there is a representative on that board who is either a former Oireachtas Member or former councillor, somebody within that new arrangement who would speak to the dynamic that exists for public representatives.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">If I understand section 2 correctly, the changes are mainly semantic, or technical amendments in the main. However, section 7 poses questions in relation to-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">Okay, but I am trying to assist the Chairman, because the substantive issues contained within the Bill in regard to declarable interests are in section 7. If a further process is necessary to examine the content of section 7, one must be mindful of what the Chairman said if section 7 is passed today.</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">To be frank about it, I am quite happy with the amendments to section 7. However, that still does not deal with the questions that have been posed by Deputy Dara Calleary and the Chairman on section 7. I am happy to agree to the amendments to section 7, but if there are content issues in section 7, the question is, do we pass section 7? If section 7 is passed, can one still submit amendments on Report Stage?</p>]
[<p eid="para_127">I have a question about chief executives of local authorities. I am glad to see they are included in this Bill. Will chief executives of local authorities have to make a declaration for the purposes of the Bill?</p>]
[<p eid="para_129">I thank the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_147">I do not know if my question is ridiculous, but I will pose it anyway. I am thinking of the county councillor, for example, who may be a solicitor, a commissioner for oaths or an auctioneer. Where a local development plan is being made, and if that person has a declarable interest in selling or ownership of that land, is there anything in this new section that strengthens the declaration or the necessity to declare an interest? Is it as is? I am trying to understand the <i>ad hoc</i> declaration which the Minister has described. I am not fully <i>au fait</i> with it yet. I think it is pertinent to section 7. If it is not, the Minister can inform me.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">If I were a teacher and also a county councillor, for example.</p>]
[<p eid="para_155">If I were a teacher and a county councillor, would I have to declare my teaching salary?</p>]
[<p eid="para_189">It is arguable that the wording is unclear. The Bill states: "Each of the interests specified in this section is a declarable interest for the purposes of this Act, and the following forms of interest are dealt with by the following subsections-----".</p>, <p eid="para_190"> I seek guidance on this issue. Does any part of the Bill explicitly say that one has to declare the source of the income as opposed to "the income"?</p>]
[<p eid="para_203">I seek clarification on periodic and <i>ad hoc</i> disclosures. Under section 7 and its attendant subsections, the <i>ad hoc</i> disclosure applies. My understanding is that the <i>ad hoc </i>disclosure is made if and when a conflict of interest arises. It is generally more effective than periodic disclosure in identifying interests likely to give rise to a conflict as the nature of the private interests to be disclosed can be defined in more general terms. Consequently, it is also better at bringing such interests into the public arena. There is an obligation on any persons or entities subject to section 7 to make the declaration. Where is the composite investigative function? Is there a composite or opposing investigative function on the part of the Standards in Public Office Commission?</p>]
[<p eid="para_272">How does this change the existing legislation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_274">Will the Minister explain that in simple terms?</p>]
[<p eid="para_294">There may be times when a person needs to discreetly deal with the Revenue Commissioners to put his or her house in order and to ensure that he or she is tax compliant, so that he or she can then furnish a tax clearance certificate. I would have a problem with SIPO or the commissioner going direct to Revenue because a person may not be compliant at a given time, but not for nefarious reasons.</p>]
[<p eid="para_298">What is the norm? Is there a rationale for the time to be 18 months?</p>]
[<p eid="para_323">How would psychological or psychiatric services apply here?</p>]
[<p eid="para_327">I would say that the rights of the person are paramount in this area and I welcome the Minister's statement that he will look at this again.</p>]
[<p eid="para_396">I am glad this provision is in place and that it is unambiguous. The existing culture in respect of the Standards in Public Office Commission is such that one can go and speak to people in that office and get guidance. To see it clearly written into legislation is to be welcomed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_402">To support that, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform might make the requisite resources available to meet the potential increase for such queries in terms of staffing requirements.</p>]
[<p eid="para_457">The value in question is â‚¬600. Most of us would have a fair sense of the value of a gift and I am sure that a couple of phone calls would let a person know what the value of the gift was, depending on its nature.</p>]
[<p eid="para_462">When I served as a Minister of State, a lot of the gifts I received and graciously accepted would have ended up on the mantlepiece of the relevant Department and are probably still there gathering dust. In practice, their value is more nominal than monetary in nature.</p>]
[<p eid="para_474">Three weeks makes sense. That is plenty of time to assess it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_485">The Minister is upholding a long-held principle in law.</p>]
[<p eid="para_488">That is fair enough.</p>]
[<p eid="para_512">I have a difficulty sometimes in understanding parliamentary legal language. The provision to the effect that the identity of the person making the complaint is not disclosed is fine, as is the provision that it relates to a private matter and is unrelated to the functions of the respondent. However, will the Minister explain the provision that "it relates in substance to a period when the respondent was not a public official"?</p>]
[<p eid="para_514">That is fine.</p>]
[<p eid="para_521">Is everything on foot of a complaint?</p>]
[<p eid="para_535">What I am confused about is the use of inverted commas in section 36(2)(a), which refers to the commissioner, "where he or she is of the opinion that there may have been a contravention of this Act (a "suspected contravention")". Why are the words "suspected contravention" in inverted commas?</p>]
[<p eid="para_537">As a suspected contravention?</p>]
[<p eid="para_544">Deputy D'Arcy is <i>ad idem</i> with the Minister?</p>]
[<p eid="para_546">I thought that the Deputy said he opposed the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_553">I have a comment also.</p>]
[<p eid="para_555">Presumably we must follow the paper trail, go back to first principles again on section 36(2)(a), which states, "the matter concerned is one in respect of which no complaint has been made to the Commissioner". The commissioner acts on the basis of a suspected contravention-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_557">-----but that is on the basis of submissions that have been made where the public official has been through an informal process in engaging with the officials within the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. It is only after a long period and informal engagement, and a lack of satisfaction on the part of the commissioner, that the commissioner can suggest - not make a finding - that an investigation be opened up. The commissioner's reason would be that he or she believes that the engagement with the public official has been insufficient and that the official has not furnished the commissioner with all the details required. The commissioner would believe that there was potential for material contravention and could then trigger an investigation. As Deputy Calleary has said, there are sufficient checks and balances built in to the process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_560">Is the preliminary inquiry held before it hits the fan, so to speak?</p>]
[<p eid="para_568">The one point here is that the Minister is empowering the deputy commissioner to appoint an investigation officer that shall be appointed for such period as the deputy commissioner may determine, shall be paid such fees and expenses as the deputy commissioner may, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determine, may resign at any time, shall hold office on such other terms and conditions as the deputy commissioner may from time to time determine, including such terms and conditions as are likely, in the opinion of the deputy commissioner, to secure the officer's independence and impartiality. The Minister is potentially going outside the fold of the Standards in Public Office Commissioner. If I were to be subjective, I would say he is conferring on the deputy commissioner powers to appoint, hire, fire and pay at will. It would be better - the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - to have an in-house investigation staffed and properly resourced rather than putting it out to tender. I assume there would have to be a tender process. If it is not open to a tender process, what other process would it be open to? I fear that the person who could be appointed, although appointed by the sheriff, so to speak, could be a bit of a lone wolf. We cannot speak to the bona fides of that person and, without prescribing this in legislation, we are relying on the discretion of the deputy commissioner. That is a little worry that I have.</p>]
[<p eid="para_572">I apologise.</p>]
[<p eid="para_574">The wording is clear. I apologise to the Minister. Section 37(1) states, "one or more members of staff of the Office of the Commissioner may be the subject of such an appointment".</p>]
[<p eid="para_579">The investigation officer can enter and "search any premises in or at which the officer has reasonable grounds for believing there may be found any document or thing relevant to an investigation being conducted under this Chapter and may seize and remove any document or thing so relevant that he or she finds in or at the premises." If this power is being conferred on the deputy commissioner, and acknowledging that we are going to come to the relevant section-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_581">I am not saying that at all and do not want to be associated with that comment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_583">I do not want to be associated with that comment because I am not saying that. I just want a deeper understanding of the dynamic that is at play here in relation to the power of the deputy commissioner and his or her staff.</p>]
[<p eid="para_587">Yes, but what is inherent in the legislation is that the commissioner has the power to appoint a deputy commissioner. Whether or not the investigation officer proceeds by virtue of an appointment internally by the deputy commissioner or the commissioner, the commissioner can still do what is outlined anyway. What is pertinent here is that the legislation provides for entering and searching a premises.</p>, <p eid="para_588">For the purposes of the current legislation, we have gone from a position where I, as a public official, will interact with a professional person to ensure that my house is in order and I am compliant with the legislation to one where, if there are sufficient grounds, subject to all the criteria proposed and if all else fails, this power is conferred on them. I am not against those powers being given. I am just trying to get a sense of where the Minister is coming from on that.</p>, <p eid="para_589"> Deputy Calleary asked if these are new sweeping powers and the motivation for them. Is it to say that we are taking a belt and braces approach to this standards in public office legislation and to have powers that are so sweeping, someone will have no other choice but to be absolutely compliant because failure to be compliant means they will literally have people knocking on their door, which is not necessarily the case at the moment? I am trying to get an understanding of the motivation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_592">I accept the changes and the motivation. Would it be possible for a report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps annually? I do not want to anonymise the efforts but I am referring to a report stating publicly the number of cases that have been investigated or where these powers have been used. In that way we would have a sense of how this new legislation will take shape. Is that a reasonable request?</p>]
[<p eid="para_594">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_596">I said "anonymise". I did not say we should publicly name people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_603">The presumption is innocence. We have to vindicate a person's good name as well. I do not believe any of us are against this legislation but we want to make sure that sufficient checks and balances are built into the investigatory powers provisions to ensure that nobody acts in a nefarious fashion to bring somebody down, so to speak, in a malevolent way. We want to make sure that the person who puts his or her name on the ballot paper or the person who is deemed to be a public official has a fair crack of the whip in terms of the way the legislation is crafted. Those are my concerns and, to be frank, I think the Minister has addressed them.</p>]
[<p eid="para_633">I have a semantic question. Section 39(1)(a) states "consider the evidence (including documents or other things)". What is that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_635">I thank the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_646">Is this a semi or quasi-judicial process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_649">Are the contents of that section similar to criminal proceedings <i>per se</i> in common law?</p>]
[<p eid="para_651">It is judicial.</p>]
[<p eid="para_657">On section 40(13)(c), which refers to "enabling the person, the subject of the investigation, and complainant (if any) or a person representing the complainant to be present at the relevant sitting", does that mean legal representation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_659">I just wanted to get that on the record.</p>]
[<p eid="para_677">I understand what privilege means in the context of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Can the Minister please explain what it means in layman's terms for the purposes of this section?</p>]
[<p eid="para_697">Yes.</p>]
