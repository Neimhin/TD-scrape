[<p eid="para_22">The question as tabled relates to the wholesale and retail sector. The latest quarterly national household survey published by the CSO on 26 May showed that the number of people employed in the wholesale and retail sector fell by 2,200 in the first quarter of this year. We acknowledge that fall.</p>, <p eid="para_23"> It is a very diverse sector and it appears the experience is different in different parts. In April, overall, the volumes and value of retail sales were up by 6.8% and 4.4% on the same period last year. Growth was concentrated in the motor, furniture, clothing, hardware and electrical sectors. By contrast, declines were recorded in the volume of activity in groceries, books and newspapers, and pharmacies. </p>, <p eid="para_24"> Structural changes, such as trading online, are occurring in the sector and are undoubtedly playing a role. On the other hand, an increase in the KBC-ESRI consumer sentiment index for April, which put Irish consumer sentiment at its strongest level since January 2007, is encouraging. However, the key challenge is to translate these improvements into jobs in the retail sector. </p>, <p eid="para_25"> This year’s Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures to support the retail sector. These measures include the establishment of a retail consultation forum to provide a platform for a structured engagement between the retail sector and relevant Departments and Government agencies. Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by the Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector. The first meeting of the forum will take place on 9 June. </p>, <p eid="para_26"> The Action Plan for Jobs also includes measures to address issues that impact on cost competitiveness in the sector, the introduction of a number of structural measures to support the retail sector, and the continuation of the online trading initiative and the integrated licensing application system for the retail sector.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">We must acknowledge that Irish shoppers spent €3.8 billion in online trading in 2012. Some 75% of the revenue goes outside the State. While I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy, we must tackle this through Deputy Tóibín's committee, which will do some work on town centre planning. If we are talking about retailers, which he mentioned, it is a question of how town centres are structured and how we encourage greater trading. I am sure the work of the Deputy's committee will feed into the retail consultation forum. It is important to state that the retail consultation forum comprises retail Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence Ireland, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and individual retail practitioners. Through that consultation process, we will address issues like town centre shopping, e-commerce, driving more business online from Irish retailers, and the cost to business of retail. There are specific issues in the grocery sector that require to be addressed. We must look at budget 2015 to see if there is any way of enhancing demand through the process. We must also look at the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, the home renovation incentive scheme and the impact of the 9% VAT rate.</p>]
[<p eid="para_30">The question tabled by the Deputy concerned the wholesale and retail sectors and I am confident that, through a process of consultation involving all the stakeholders, thorough engagement and giving effect to many initiatives that arise from the retail consultation forum, we can work towards increasing the number of people employed in the retail sector. We wholeheartedly acknowledge that, year-on-year between 2013 and 2014, there has been a drop of 5,900 in the number of people employed in the sectors. We must do something to address that decline and the decline of our towns through the doughnut effect. The Deputy referred to the retailers he is meeting and the level of confidence. Through engaging with those retailers and their representative organisations, we can arrest the decline. I am confident that, once the process starts on 9 June, we will take action.</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">In the three years before the Government came into office, more than 300,000 jobs had been lost across the economy. The construction, retail and tourism sectors were particularly badly hit and collectively accounted for over two thirds of the job losses. Almost 150,000 jobs were lost in the construction sector alone between the beginning of 2008 and the beginning of 2011.</p>, <p eid="para_61"> In 2012, the Government introduced the Action Plan for Jobs as the main policy instrument to tackle the employment crisis and to assist job creation. Now in its third annual iteration, the action plan has set about transforming the operating environment for businesses by seeking to identify and remove barriers to competitiveness and by placing employment on the agenda of every Department. The latest employment figures published by the Central Statistics Office show there was an increase of 42,700 people in employment in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the first quarter of 2013. There was an increase of 63,200 in the numbers in employment in the last two years. These figures are net of reductions in public sector numbers. More than 67% of the jobs created since 2012 have been full time. In the last six months, almost all the jobs created in the economy were full time. The sectors that have consistently performed well are agriculture, food and fishing, accommodation and food services, tourism and professional, scientific and technical activities. These sectors have been the focus for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_62"> In 2013, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client companies had record years for employment creation, generating a total of 12,500 net new jobs in export-focused activities. These patterns suggest the jobs being created are adding value to the economy and have every potential to be sustainable. However, we must continue to focus on sectors that did not experience a jobs recovery over the past two years. The wholesale and retail sector, which we discussed earlier, continues to suffer job losses, while the pattern is similar in the construction sector. There are moves to intervene in both sectors.</p>]
[<p eid="para_64">There is a specific policy instrument for the construction sector. Construction 2020 sets out a series of policy interventions in consultation with sectoral representatives regarding how the housing shortage can be addressed and how the sector, which took a major hit, particularly in the three years prior to 2011, can be stimulated.</p>]
[<p eid="para_66">Yes. A specific initiative is under way, particularly aimed at the Dublin region, under the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I can engage further with the Deputy on this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_70">I understand from EI that it has been actively promoting the site concerned to a number of interested parties. I am not in a position to disclose the details of those interactions for commercially sensitive reasons.</p>, <p eid="para_71"> However, task forces have been used in the past as part of a response to a sudden loss of a large number of industrial jobs. More recently, other initiatives are increasingly used as an alternative to task forces. In this regard, the establishment of LEOs, recently announced by Government, means that all categories of business, including sole traders, micro businesses and SMEs have access to Government supports and advice. The LEO is the first-stop shop for anyone seeking information and support on starting or enhancing a business.</p>, <p eid="para_72"> The active promotion of the site is taking place. EI is actively engaged in seeking to ensure the jobs that were lost are replaced.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy in regard to the effect of the loss of a company like this to a town like Fethard. In south Tipperary, where Enterprise Ireland is the lead agency in efforts to ensure we replace and create jobs, there are 76 client companies employing more than 2,000 people in full-time jobs. These are the figures for 2013. In excess of €9 million worth of grants has been paid to client companies since 2011. I assure the Deputy that Enterprise Ireland is working actively as the representative State agency in seeking to ensure we can replace the jobs that have been lost. It is actively promoting the site to a number of interested parties as we speak.</p>]
[<p eid="para_76">As far as I am aware, there is no formal task force working on this, such as the task force for the south east where all the agencies are working together. I assure the Deputy, however, that the local agencies are working together. Enterprise Ireland is the pre-eminent State agency and it is working proactively on this. It is promoting the site to a number of interested parties. I ask the Deputy to allow that process to take shape. I am sure he will acknowledge that Enterprise Ireland is working with interested parties to seek to replace the jobs that have been lost.</p>]
[<p eid="para_130">The Deputy should use Private Members' time to do so.</p>]
[<p eid="para_132">I doubt Sinn Féin will use Private Members' time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_136">I thank the Deputy for tabling the question. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, developing a better environment for entrepreneurship is a key disruptive reform. The work of the Entrepreneurship Forum has been a valuable input to identify areas for fruitful initiative. The Department is developing a national policy statement on entrepreneurship. As part of this process, the forum’s recommendations are being evaluated with input from Departments and agencies. Already, a significant number of initiatives have been taken which respond to the forum’s evaluation.</p>, <p eid="para_137">These include the launch of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the initiation of a competition to find and to invest in the best young entrepreneurs at local and national level, the creation of a new ICT skills strategy 2014-18, the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Ireland and its online database of innovative ideas, as well as turning those ideas that come from intellectual property through the universities and institutes of technology into new companies. In addition, a review of mentoring is being prepared by Forfás and a review of tax supports is under way for entrepreneurs. The initiatives also include an assessment of how the agencies in the Department can deliver targeted improvements in the environment for business, particularly for start-ups, and the preparation of a strategy statement 2014-16 by Enterprise Ireland with new ambitions for high-potential start-ups. There is a strong belief that the start-ups area offers huge opportunity for enhanced performance and jobs growth by the Irish enterprise sector and the Government is determined to facilitate this through a national policy statement on entrepreneurship.</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">Many of the recommendations made actually cut across measures that are being implemented anyway. It is unfair to suggest that the Government is not engaging proactively with the recommendations. It acknowledges wholeheartedly the role played by the chairman and individual members in bringing forward these recommendations. I can tell the Deputy that, internally, there is no sense of lethargy about engaging properly. However, he must acknowledge that if one is to take all the recommendations, of which there are at least 69, one must have some sort of process to ensure the State agencies can respond and that there is an interdepartmental response.</p>, <p eid="para_141"> As I outlined already in my initial reply, the Government has launched the local enterprise offices, which will cut across a lot of the recommendations made. Similarly, the ICT skills strategy will cut across a lot of the recommendations that were made, as will the review by Forfás on mentoring. Consequently, there is no sense that the Department is not engaging with the recommendations. I assure the Deputy and those people who have been in contact with the Deputy and who may have expressed concerns that the Government is absolutely and utterly intent on ensuring that the national policy statement will reflect the views put forward and the recommendations proposed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">I did not answer the question on the number of people who have been assigned. A number of people have been appointed through Enterprise Ireland in Asia, comprising ten new people across Asia. I can get a specific figure for the Deputy in respect of China.</p>, <p eid="para_145"> To my mind, the interdepartmental approach works quite rapidly at present. If one examines again the recommendations made in the Entrepreneurship Forum report, it is evident that the Government is moving rapidly and actually was ahead of some of the recommendations in respect of outcomes, particularly, for example, with regard to the higher level sector where there is a strong move towards ensuring that research works in a way that turns those good ideas into good jobs. The Government has created Knowledge Transfer Ireland and has ensured there are more post-doctoral and PhD programmes. For instance, there are specific arrangements pertaining to the Irish Research Council on having more enterprise-facing PhD programmes. That is one recommendation that already is under way. The point must be made that while the Government acknowledges the recommendations and is working towards meeting them, it will reflect these outcomes through the national policy statement.</p>]
