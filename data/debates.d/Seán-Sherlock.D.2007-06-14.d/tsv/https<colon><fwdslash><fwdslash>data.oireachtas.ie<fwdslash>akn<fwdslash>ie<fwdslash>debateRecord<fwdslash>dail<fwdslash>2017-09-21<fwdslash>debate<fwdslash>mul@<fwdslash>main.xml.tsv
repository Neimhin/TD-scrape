SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-21T14:55:00+01:00	I have a technical question. The Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill is on the long list. The Government had given some indication that it would legislate for the prohibition of micro-plastics in that Bill. I would like the Government to clarify when it will legislate for that. I have a Bill that is due before committee. The ten-week window has long since passed. I had said to the Government that I was willing to wait for the publication of its legislation and that I will be happy to withdraw mine if it passes muster. That still has not happened. What is the status of the Government's proposed Bill?
