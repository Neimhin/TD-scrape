[<p eid="para_137">I would like to return to the tracker mortgage issue. Under the Central Bank review, as I understand it, where customers made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and where those complaints were actually upheld in Permanent TSB's favour, the complaints were also to become part of this review. Even where the FSO found against the customer, that customer was still to be contacted. I listened carefully to Mr. Mitchell's description of trying and failing to contact certain customers, but is Permanent TSB satisfied that it has contacted all customers? I ask that question because I have a specific case that could be representative of a sample of cases where the individual has not been contacted at all. This individual is still at the same address as before and continues to be a Permanent TSB customer. I worry that perhaps not everybody has been included in this investigation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_139">That is interesting. What does Mr. Mitchell mean when he says that they "are in the process of being contacted"? That suggests to me that not everybody has been contacted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_141">Forgive me, I do not want to be too pedantic but I just want to really understand this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_143">The very specific case that I have was the subject of an FSO complaint. The individual in question should<i> prima facie</i> have been contacted but has not been. Could I correspond with the bank with regard to this specific case? I am worried that it could perhaps represent a sample of cases. That is my central point here.</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">Is Mr. Masding satisfied that Permanent TSB is fulfilling its legal obligations under data protection law? Let me be more specific. I assume the witnesses are aware that banks are legally obliged to retain all communications for six years after the ending of a product. A 30-year mortgage, for example, would result in a bank retaining records for 36 years. Is Mr. Masding satisfied that Permanent TSB is retaining all of those records with regard to correspondence with the customer, even where the customer makes a complaint? This might include phone records, emails or any kind of electronic communications with those customers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_148">The witnesses acknowledge, then, that there was a lapse. How systemic was that lapse and how many customers were affected by it? I ask the witnesses to be specific.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">Absolutely. Again, one suspects that this is symptomatic. It goes back to the tracker mortgage issue where complaints where made to the FSO, where somebody sought records and was unable to obtain them from Permanent TSB. This weakened that individual's case and, indeed, rights.</p>, <p eid="para_154">The bank was clearly in breach of the legislation in not retaining fully the records as per its obligations. The witnesses have acknowledged that in one case, but I would suggest, as with the one case I am referring to, there is probably more than one. The bank has acknowledged it will gladly accept correspondence from me relating to that, if I understand the witnesses correctly. I put it to the witnesses that the data protection law is the one protection the customer has when it hits the fan. If institutions such as Permanent TSB do not protect customers' rights in that respect, it is a serious failing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_156">How often does the bank correspond with or meet the regulatory authorities regarding its obligations under the Data Protection Act?</p>]
[<p eid="para_158">If the person to whom I am referring requests their records tomorrow, can they be satisfied that those records are retained?</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">Pretend I am an ordinary customer. Can every customer be satisfied that their records-----</p>]
