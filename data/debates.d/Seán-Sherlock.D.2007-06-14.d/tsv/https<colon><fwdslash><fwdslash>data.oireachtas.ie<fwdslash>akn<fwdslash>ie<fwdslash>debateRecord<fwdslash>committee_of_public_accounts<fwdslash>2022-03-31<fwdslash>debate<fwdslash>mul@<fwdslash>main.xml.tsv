[<p eid="para_265">I, too, welcome the Commissioner and his colleagues to our committee this morning. I would like a better understanding of the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau and how it operates. How many investigating gardaí or officers are assigned to that unit?</p>]
[<p eid="para_267">I welcome that. I suppose I am trying to get at whether it is seen as a priority for An Garda Síochána on the basis of the growth of cybercrime. It is now such a vast area of crime. It is a relatively new frontier or phenomenon. One worries that not enough resources are being deployed at the coalface to meet the crime detection requirements. If one could be disabused of that notion, it would certainly give some confidence.</p>]
[<p eid="para_270">I thank the Commissioner. I appreciate the answer. If the figures on personnel were made available to the committee, they would certainly be very useful to us. A statement of the Garda Commissioner’s intention from a policy point of view to increase the numbers of staff in the cybercrime unit would give the public some confidence also.</p>, <p eid="para_271"> I just want to move on to-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_273">By my calculation, that is moving up to 380.</p>]
[<p eid="para_275">Could I move on to the justice plan? The Commissioner made reference to the digital recording Bill. The Garda Representative Association has been very strong on the need for body-worn camera, bodycam, units. These will be legislated for in the digital recording Bill, presumably. What engagement has the Commissioner had with the Minister for Justice on that Bill? Assuming that the Bill becomes law, how will the Garda deploy resources? While my question is theoretical in advance of the legislation being passed, I am sure the Commissioner is planning for the eventuality of body-worn cameras being rolled out. I would like a sense of his perspective on this issue and how he envisages the technology being deployed as a resource for gardaí.</p>]
[<p eid="para_278">I thank the Commissioner. I have less than one minute left. I want to dovetail with Deputy Colm Burke's point in respect of Macroom. The issue relating to Macroom is important for policing in an entire region, as the Commissioner can imagine. It is quite literally policing from the Kerry border over to the Waterford border and north to counties Limerick and Tipperary. That is not an insignificant area. It is arguable that Fermoy, which is the pre-existing divisional headquarters in County Cork, is a building that was fit for purpose when it was constructed but that is no longer suitable. Until Macroom comes on stream, an increasing number of gardaí will be going into pre-existing infrastructure. I wonder what kind of affect that has on the morale of gardaí when they are going into buildings that are substandard or not fit for purpose. What we want is modern buildings for gardaí to police from. That would be my humble opinion. I am sure if one is in a fit-for-purpose building, one's morale is that bit higher and so forth.</p>, <p eid="para_279"> I support Deputy Colm Burke's point about the need to ensure resources are deployed. I might have views with regard to Fermoy and Mallow, for instance. I might be a bit parochial about the fact that we found it strange that it was going to Macroom, but that is a matter of policy. We need to ensure that resources are deployed in terms of capital expenditure on buildings, however, and they need to be rolled out as quickly as possible. That is the general point in support of Deputy Colm Burke.</p>]
