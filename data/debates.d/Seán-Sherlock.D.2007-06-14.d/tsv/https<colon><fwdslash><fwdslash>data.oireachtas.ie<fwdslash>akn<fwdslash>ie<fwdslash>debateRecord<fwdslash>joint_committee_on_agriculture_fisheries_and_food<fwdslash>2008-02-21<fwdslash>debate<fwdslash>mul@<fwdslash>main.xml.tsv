[<p eid="para_33">I will be brief.  That the scheme has been in place for 14 years is a testament to its success and without repeating too many of Deputy Doyle's comments, it was predicated on a significant buy-in from the farming organisations, farming communities and banks.  The scheme's very success means it should continue into REPS 4 and the methods of payments also should continue as designated in REPS 2 and REPS 3.  The question is whether the Commission will agree to such a proposal.  I strongly advocate its continuation, through both members' contacts and lobbying at European level.  The scheme should continue as is because it is highly successful and the Irish mechanism should be used as a benchmark for the rest of Europe because of the sheer volume of farmers who have taken it up, as well as the projected increases over the next six years.</p>, <p eid="para_34">Members support unequivocally the IFA's position on this issue.  In fairness to the Minister and her departmental officials, through their meetings with Commission officials I understand they have been lobbying hard on the issue and members should acknowledge this.  It is a worthwhile scheme that is worthy of continuation.  We support it unequivocally.</p>, <p eid="para_35">It seems strange and incongruous that the European Commission would make an announcement of this nature at a time when Ireland was set consider ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  There was a degree of naivety on its part.  Is it any wonder that there is scepticism about the EU and its workings when decisions like this are made at such times?  Some will beg to differ with me on this issue.</p>]
