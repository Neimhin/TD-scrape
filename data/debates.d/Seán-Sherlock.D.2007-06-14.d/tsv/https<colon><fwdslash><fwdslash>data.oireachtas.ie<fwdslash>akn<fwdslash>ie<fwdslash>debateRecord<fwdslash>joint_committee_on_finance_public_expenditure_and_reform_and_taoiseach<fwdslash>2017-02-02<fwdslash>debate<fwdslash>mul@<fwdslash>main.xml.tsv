[<p eid="para_72">At the joint committee meeting she attended recently, the Commissioner stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_73">I can say how it looks from my side. We did not investigate how Apple organised its operations. We did not investigate the cost-sharing agreements. We did not investigate the fact that Apple records its profits in Cork, Ireland.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_74"> We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland. We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity. That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_75">I am trying to reconcile, in my own mind, the statement made by the Department of Finance on the Irish branches of Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. Can the Minister give us an opinion on the Commissioner's statement, particularly on the stateless headquarters and the activity levels she says were not supported by economic activity?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">The Commissioner went on to say, "We do not investigate or value the intellectual property." If I interpret it correctly, in dealing with activity levels in Ireland, they are actually putting a value on the intellectual property, or they are at least stating it to be economic activity. Am I wrong in this contention?</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">The kernel of the case will be in tax sovereignty for the Irish people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_83">The base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process speaks to that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_272">I also welcome the Revenue Commissioners. I am trying to distil this. In respect of the theme around the methodologies, the Commission has stated that the decision of 30 August asserts that the two opinions given in 1991 and 2007 by Revenue renounced tax revenue that Ireland would otherwise have been entitled to collect from the Irish branches of Apple Sales International, ASI, and Apple Operations Europe, AOE. Mr. Cody speaks of a mis-characterisation. I think those were the words he used in the documents we have. Will he explain what he means? What is meant by "renounced" in this instance?</p>]
[<p eid="para_274">Correct me if my mathematics are wrong, if the tax liability is €13 billion and for the sake of argument, the tax rate is 10%, the economic activity is €130 billion, if I am correct. What the Commission is saying is that in this instance, there was €130 billion worth of economic activity conducted on the island of Ireland through two entities. Is that correct based on that model?</p>]
[<p eid="para_276">That is what it is saying.</p>]
[<p eid="para_278">I return to the Commissioner's comments when she appeared before the committee the other day. She said:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_279">We were looking at whether the allocation of profits was recorded in the branch and whether, therefore, it had to be taxed in Ireland, or recorded in the stateless headquarters and, therefore, not to be taxed in Ireland. We found that the recordings by Apple, which we did not question, could not be supported by economic activity. That is why they ought to be recorded in the branch of the company that is taxable in Ireland. </p>, <p eid="para_280">She went on to state: </p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_281">We do not investigate or value the intellectual property. We have not done that here. We have seen that Apple has organised itself with what it refers to as a cost-sharing agreement. This means that most of the research and development takes place at the Apple Inc. facility in Cupertino. </p>, <p eid="para_282"> I am trying to get my head around this. In Mr. Cody's lines of argument, he states that the Commission's attribution of Apple's intellectual property licences to the Irish branches of AOE and ASI is not consistent with Irish law and, moreover, is inconsistent with the principles it claims to apply, as is its stated refusal to take into account the activities of Apple Inc. There is no reconciliation between those two statements. I am trying to distil the contradiction in layperson's terms. In respect of the intellectual property piece, the Minister asked us to refer to the phones and so on being made in China and the intellectual property in Cupertino. Can somebody distill that for me in bare simple terms? Where does the intellectual property piece fit into all this if the Commissioner is saying that the Commission did not investigate or value the intellectual property? Mr. Cody is saying that the intellectual property is not generated in Ireland. If I am interpreting the Commissioner correctly, she is saying that the Commission is not investigating the intellectual property so, therefore, it is not investigating an Irish operation in that sense. How do we reconcile that? How do we get a better understanding of that dynamic? </p>]
[<p eid="para_285">Did the two opinions of 1991 and 2007 speak to the issue of intellectual property? If I understood Mr. Cody's interaction with Deputy Michael McGrath correctly, the Revenue Commissioners would have kicked the tyres on the two opinions given. Did Revenue look at the issue of intellectual property in that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_287">I have two very simple technical questions. What is the arm's-length principle? Why has the Commission applied it incorrectly, in Mr. Cody's view?</p>]
