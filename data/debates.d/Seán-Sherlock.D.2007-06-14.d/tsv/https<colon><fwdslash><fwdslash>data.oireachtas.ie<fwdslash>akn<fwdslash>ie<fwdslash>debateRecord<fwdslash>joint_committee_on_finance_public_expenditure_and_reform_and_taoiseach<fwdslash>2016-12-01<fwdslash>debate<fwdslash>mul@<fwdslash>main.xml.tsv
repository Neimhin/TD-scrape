SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:40:00+00:00	Could that be published or made available to this committee? There was in the United Kingdom a process in which Royal Bank of Scotland provided €400 million to compensate small business customers.There is a question mark as to whether or not, as a result of the GRG process, there are businesses in this State that could be eligible for compensation among the 2,000 odd businesses we have discussed. This committee will have to explore this matter further and it will endeavour to bring in people whose businesses have been directly affected by this GRG process. Does Mr. Blair foresee that compensation will be paid out to customers in this State?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:50:00+00:00	We should not be pedantic at this stage, although perhaps Mr. Blair is not being deliberately pedantic on this one.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:50:00+00:00	Has Mr. Blair made provision on the books for compensation to small business operators in this State?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:50:00+00:00	Does Mr. Blair foresee making such provision?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:50:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Blair.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T10:50:00+00:00	That is it on GRG, but I would like to come back in later.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T11:30:00+00:00	I will lighten the load somewhat for Mr. Mallon. I ask Mr. Mallon to give the perspective of Ulster Bank and that of its parent on Brexit from a macroeconomic viewpoint. He spoke about some headwinds coming down the track regarding Brexit. He spoke about Ulster Bank's strategic position vis-à-vis the parent company, which has inoculated it, for want of a better word. This committee and the Houses in general are trying to get as many perspectives as possible on the outworkings of Brexit. It would be interesting to get Mr. Mallon's perspective on the significance of Brexit. I do not necessarily expect him to go into the political realm, but there are the permutations of the triggering of Article 50 and the permutations of a hard Brexit. Is Ulster Bank doing any forward planning for a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit with access to the European market?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T11:30:00+00:00	Is there significant variance on that point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-12-01T11:40:00+00:00	Are the witnesses going into the Treasury lobbying on issues like this or making their views known or expressing concerns along those lines in regard to access to the Single Market and the tariff issue?
