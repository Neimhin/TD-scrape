[<p eid="para_32">I wish thank the officials for appearing before the committee.  On a first reading of the submission, it appears that Mr. Kearns is talking common sense in terms of the approach to prudential supervision, the stabilisation fund and the need for some degree of flexibility in section 35.  While the Minister seems to be sympathetic to people who find themselves constrained by the fact that their loans have finite term limits, and one needs to reflect the reality of people's lives by extending the lifetime of a loan, the question now arises as to the effect that will have on liquidity ratios and so forth.  I would like to hear a view from the officials to flesh that out and explain in practical terms what the Minister or the Department might propose on section 35 for allowing people to have more flexibility, but without affecting a credit union's own liquidity ratios.  How will they get around that particular issue?</p>, <p eid="para_33">I acknowledge that things have moved on significantly since the McDowell report.  In his statement, Mr. Kearns said that "recognising these factors, the Government decision of June 2009 on the reform of financial regulatory structures determined that there would be no change in the positioning of the Registrar of Credit Unions within the framework of the new, integrated structure for the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator".  To be clear, does that mean that the regulation of credit unions will remain within the ambit or under the umbrella of the Central Bank?  If that is the case, will the reporting procedure be changed in any way?  For instance, will the registrar report directly to the head of financial regulation, or is it proposed that the registrar will report directly to the assistant director general?  Given the nature of credit unions, and the differentiation that we make between banks and not-for-profit friendly societies whose surplus is redistributed, could we make a case that the reporting procedure would be such that they would report directly to the Financial Regulator?  That covers section 35 and the reporting mechanism.</p>, <p eid="para_34">Is it now proposed that the review will examine the stabilisation fund with a view to bringing all credit unions, no matter what their size, into that remit?  How will that play out in practical terms?  Mr. Kearns said the Minister for Finance has stated that his preferred option is to have a proofed stabilisation arrangement in place for all credit unions in addition to having the deposit guarantee scheme in place.  There is a double effect then with the stabilisation fund, so how is it envisaged that the stabilisation fund will work for smaller credit unions which would not be operating on the same economies of scale as larger ones?  I would be glad if Mr. Kearns could tease out those points.</p>]
[<p eid="para_37">Mr. Kearns stated they will look for specific recommendations.  Will they come from the sector itself or will he make recommendations?</p>]
[<p eid="para_41">What about the reporting mechanism and section 35?</p>]
[<p eid="para_47">The reporting procedure could be a matter for the discretion of the Commission itself.</p>]
[<p eid="para_53">I take it there is ongoing engagement in regard to this stabilisation fund and the section 35 provisions.  Is it an open-ended process?  I presume a sunset has been put on it.  When is it proposed to wrap up that process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_133">Is Mr. MacDonncha referring to the case in which somebody defaulted on a credit union loan?</p>]
[<p eid="para_146">The Irish League of Credit Unions led the joint committee to believe that this measure could be introduced by way of ministerial order.  That, at least, is my interpretation of the league's submission.  My question is subjective and, as such, I understand if the witnesses are unable to answer it.  Could the league have been misled, albeit advertently, in terms of its interpretation of its consultations on the matter with departmental officials?</p>]
