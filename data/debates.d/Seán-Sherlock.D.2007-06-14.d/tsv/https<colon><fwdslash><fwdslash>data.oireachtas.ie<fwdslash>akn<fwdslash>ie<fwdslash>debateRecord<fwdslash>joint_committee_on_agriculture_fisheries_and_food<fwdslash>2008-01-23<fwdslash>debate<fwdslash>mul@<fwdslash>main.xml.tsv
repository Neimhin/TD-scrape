[<p eid="para_41">Thank you, Chairman, and I thank the contributors for what they have placed before us.  One senses a shift in the Government's position.  The committee should know, either from today's contributors or directly from the Minister, the exact and unequivocal Government position on genetically modified foods.</p>, <p eid="para_42">I am confused about the process.  I appreciate there is a stringent scientific process and I am not a scientist.  A rationale is applied and one must go along with rational science with regard to testing and so on.  If a qualified majority is not reached at the Council of Ministers and the decision reverts to the Commission, how does the Commission have the mandate to make a decision on genetically modified organisms if no decision has been made at Council?  If I am misinterpreting the statement made, I will welcome correction.  I would like clarification on that point.</p>, <p eid="para_43">The Herculex incident is well documented.  Is the Government satisfied with the level and extent of testing of products coming into the EU?  Is the Government satisfied with the level of testing?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">There is a dichotomy, given the fact that unauthorised GM foods have been imported here over a period of years and the Government seems to believe there is no inconsistency between this and stating Ireland is GM free.  Perhaps there is a distinction to be made between cultivation and importation.  From the point of view of protecting agriculture, I do not see a contradiction between the importation of GM substances that have been rigorously tested and the Government's taking a firm position at Council level on that process and maintaining biodiversity.  In a nutshell, the Government needs to take a less ambivalent position on the matter.  It needs to be unequivocal at Council level <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the process of GM importation.</p>]
