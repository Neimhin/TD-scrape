[<p eid="para_570">I am delighted that Deputy Ó Ríordáin is sharing his time with me. I acknowledge the work of Mallow Development Partnership in the excellent Munster Maths and Science Fair that took place on 16 October this year. Up to 5,000 people attended and it was sponsored by the Irish American Partnership and Cork County Council, working through the Mallow Development Partnership to bring science to the people. I pay tribute to everybody who was involved. Although the event takes place every year on a Sunday, if the Minister is of a mind and is still in the Department this time next year we would be delighted to welcome him to Mallow. He could see for himself the interplay between students, members of the public and research entities like Teagasc and all the citizen science engagement that takes place. It was a perfect model and I acknowledge the successful role played by Mallow Development Partnership in bringing it about. It was bringing science to the people and an excellent example of science in action.</p>, <p eid="para_571"> An entity close to my own heart is the Irish Centre for Maternal and Child Health Research, INFANT, in Cork. It is such an important entity in terms of perinatal healthcare, making pregnancy safe for women, ensuring the health and future well-being of children and improving the survival and long-term health outcomes for newborn babies. The Minister must forgive me for being parochial again, but if he ever happens to find himself visiting University College Cork and if he visits INFANT, he will see for himself the excellent work that is carried. It is really impactful research meeting societal challenges, which is so important to all of us. </p>, <p eid="para_572"> It is incongruous that at a time we are setting up the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, to deal with consents and licences around offshore wind, we have a world-class entity called MaREI doing world-class research on offshore wind. The science has moved ahead of implementation on the ground, on the seabed or floating on the water. What I mean is that while we are doing excellent research here, we need MARA to issue those consents when it is created in order that the excellent research on wind turbines and offshore wind can lead to a throughput of projects to deal with our future energy needs. We can be concentrating on the excellence of science in Ireland but if it does not have the impact on the island of Ireland or off our shores and if there is not expeditious connectivity with industry, the gap will need to be plugged. If the Minister visits Cork, he should talk to the people in MaREI and he will see the potential.</p>]
[<p eid="para_796">We in Labour support the call of retained firefighters for a more sustainable and improved working model including decent pay, fixed incomes and structured, limited working hours that are consistent with the European working time directive. The current recruitment and retention crisis is a result of poor terms and conditions of employment and the constant failure to resource and fund adequately the retained fire service. Retained firefighters are on call 24 hours per day, 340 days per year.</p>, <p eid="para_797"> Retainers are paid between €8,696 and €11,907 depending on experience. Salary and pay depends on the number of call-outs workers attend, however, meaning that many are forced to work second jobs or avail of social welfare payments to supplement their income. Furthermore, the lack of a fixed income makes it difficult for retained firefighters to get a mortgage. I have first-hand experience of that with constituents of mine. Retained firefighters are effectively locked out of social participation. When they are called to duty, they must be within five minutes of the fire station. This places severe restrictions on their ability to participate in everyday activities such as bringing their children to school, playing a football match, visiting relatives, attending social occasions or even going for a short walk. They are essentially under a form of house arrest while on call. It is unfathomable that we would expect these workers to put up with such conditions.</p>, <p eid="para_798"> Poor pay and conditions have resulted in this crisis of retention and recruitment. Some sources indicate that as many as 60% of workers, and we heard this already tonight, are considering leaving the service in the very near future. Staff shortages among the fire service pose a serious threat to delivery and consequently to everyone's safety. If a crew responding to an emergency does not have sufficient numbers to enter a fire, we could be talking about a potential loss of life.</p>, <p eid="para_799"> The last collective agreement made with retained firefighters was 23 years ago and the model has not kept pace with the changes to the socioeconomic and working landscape of the country. Retained firefighters are suffering economically, socially and mentally. It is time the Government introduced a more sustainable model that will address the recruitment and retention crisis and show these vital workers that it recognises their value and contribution to our safety as citizens by providing them with good pay and working conditions. They deserve nothing less. They are our friends, neighbours and family members. We know them; they live within our communities. They are always around and always on call. We must value them.</p>, <p eid="para_800"> I echo the points of previous Deputies in respect of the fact that we have not been issued with a copy of the Minister's speech. It is important in debates like this for us to have a copy in order that we can parse the words of the Minister as he is speaking so we can respond on the hoof, as it were. I note that he said the review will be published shortly. He talked about changes in structures, culture and the delivery model. He spoke about a sequence of steps for a new model of delivery. To be fair to him, I have no doubt about the Minister's bona fides in seeking to arrive at a solution whereby everybody can be dealt with to the satisfaction of all. I suggest to the Minister that this is not just about statistics regarding fires. We know it is important to have an assessment of the other services that are delivered by retained firefighters in terms of call-outs. There needs to be a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the types of call-outs that take place in communities such as those I serve in which firefighters are called out for any manner and number of reasons. That must also be factored in when the Minister talks about a new model of delivery.</p>, <p eid="para_801"> The bottom line for all of us is that in supporting the Sinn Féin motion, we acknowledge the role of firefighters within our communities. We have all done that collectively tonight but we must now move beyond the phase of empathy and sympathy for their position into a phase where we have some regard to concrete timelines for delivery. If I understand the Minister correctly, he is saying he is moving or seeks to move in that direction and that he will work with the interested parties to deliver a new model. Inherent within that, however, must be a recognition of the pay and conditions of workers. There needs to be a significant improvement on that. If I were to ask the Minister one thing tonight, it would be to give us some concrete timeline in respect of when he expects this process to be completed with a view to ensuring that everything he spoke about in his appreciation of the work retained firefighters do will be recognised and in that appreciation and recognition of their role, the fruits of their labour will be recognised and we will see real and concrete delivery of better pay and conditions as the primary aim of all of this. Will he please give us the timelines as to when that will be delivered?</p>, <p eid="para_802"> The Minister spoke of the implications for both sides. I am not quite sure exactly what he means when he says that. I suppose he is talking about the workers and the employer. There is always a way of finding solutions, however. Ultimately, we want to ensure that we have a cohort of professional people and that it is an attractive profession to enter. The Minister said that is what he wants to achieve. Let us take him at his word. He might give us timelines, however. I also note the Minister made reference to gender equality in respect of recruitment and retention. We absolutely support him in that regard. At the end of the day, I was hopeful that we would have a set of timelines.</p>, <p eid="para_803">I would not accuse the Minister of this, to be fair, but very often we have aspirational and empathetic statements by Ministers coming before us. What the people in the Gallery and those watching outside really want is a clear indication of the timelines for delivery. That is the bottom line. When will this new model be rolled out? What is the timeline and the stage-gate process that has to be gone through to ensure we get over all the hurdles and challenges? We must ensure that in the communities that we all serve, there is a fit-for-purpose retained fire service in which morale is high and the staff are happy to do their jobs. We must continue to recognise the work they are doing and ensure the terms and conditions of employment are fit for purpose and are not anachronistic. We should not take them for granted. If I dare say it, I think they may be taken for granted within our communities. That is something that needs to be addressed seriously. The process the Minister talks about seems to be real, if it is chaired by Mr. Begg. However, we will have to see implementation of it.</p>]
