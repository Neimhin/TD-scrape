[<p eid="para_84">On 30 June, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced the establishment of a cross-Government implementation group on cloud computing.  This group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, comprises representatives of Departments and agencies responsible for all aspects of cloud computing policy, IT procurement, security, infrastructure and enterprise policy.  The group last met on 28 September.  In addition, the group's work was complemented by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in 23 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies being facilitated by my Department.</p>, <p eid="para_85">In conducting its work, the group examined the opportunities and challenges presented by cloud computing for business and government from the following perspectives: the cloud as a source for exports, growth and jobs;  the adequacy of key infrastructures; the regulatory environment; the opportunities and benefits for indigenous enterprises; the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment; and Government as a leader and user of the cloud.</p>, <p eid="para_86">The Secretary General of the Department, upon his recent retirement, submitted a draft interim report to the Minister.  This report is currently being reviewed by the group and it is intended that the group will meet shortly for the purpose of agreeing the content of the report and an action plan to implement its recommendations.  The group's final report is expected before the end of this year.</p>, <p eid="para_87">Ireland is extremely well placed to take advantage of the rapidly growing international potential of cloud computing.  A recent report commissioned by Microsoft has estimated that, by 2014, the cloud computing industry in Ireland could be worth €9.5 billion and employ between 8,500 and 9,000 people.  Now, more than ever, we must do everything we can to seize opportunities like this.  These jobs will be created automatically, and the Government must act decisively and urgently if we are to position Ireland as a world leader in this high-growth sector.  The commitment in the programme for Government on cloud computing sets out the Government's intentions in this important area of the ICT industry.</p>]
[<p eid="para_89">Our job is to engage with the centre for management and organisation development, CMOD.  The Government acknowledges the possibilities of this.  One could say work is ongoing on making the ICT infrastructure more user friendly.  There will be challenges, potentially in regard to industrial relations peace, but I believe strongly that through proper engagement with all the stakeholders across government and by taking a more horizontal approach as opposed to the more siloed approach we are used to, we can achieve something and become global leaders in adopting early new technologies such as that associated with cloud computing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">I did not quite get the last point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">I am not aware of such problems.  I say that openly and honestly.  Research is ongoing and the centre is in the process of developing a cloud computing strategy for the public service, which it intends to bring to the Government for consideration and approval in the first quarter of 2012.  If a specific issue arises, I would love to hear the Deputy's thoughts.</p>]
[<p eid="para_96">I fundamentally disagree with the Deputy.  If he is willing to show me the source of the statistics he cited, I will revert to him on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_98">EMC, the Irish Internet Association, Facebook, IBM, Microsoft, Fujitsu, Dell and A&amp;L Goodbody are all engaged in this process.  It is a worthwhile process because if we can become global leaders by dint of being early adopters we will have a competitive advantage.  I recognise that problems arise in broadband provision but the capacity is present in terms of cloud.  If the Deputy engages further with the Department, we can send him some facts on the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">On job creation, this Department must deal with the reality of the capital funding available to it.  On 10 November the Government published its infrastructural and capital investment medium-term Exchequer framework for the period 2012 to 2016.  Overall, capital investment totalling €17 billion has been allocated across Departments.  In one way or another, all of this €17 billion ultimately has a focus on job creation.  The Government's role is to create the conditions within which it will maximise the impact of this capital allocation and support the private sector in the creation of jobs.  Within the medium-term framework the State's support to enterprise and innovation has been protected and prioritised and clear targets for job creation have been set.  When averaged over the lifetime of the framework, the job creation targets for Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are set to approximately 22,659 per annum.</p>, <p eid="para_146">The capital allocation for programmes funded by the Department is to be increased in 2012 to €514 million, an increase of €6 million on the 2011 allocation, and supports to industry will be maintained in excess of pre-recession levels when total capital expenditure was at its highest.  This represents a strong commitment in this Department to the development of enterprise and provides the development agencies with sufficient resources to target aggressively the projects and investments that will drive economic renewal.  In setting out this level of capital investment in the productive economy the Government has been cognisant of issues, including maximising the achievement of value for money and the sustainability of job creation measures.</p>, <p eid="para_147">While the notion of spending an additional €3.1 billion per annum on job creation might sound attractive, what the economy needs is structural change.  The Government must ensure the enterprise development supports and agencies are fit for purpose and well positioned to help Ireland to move out of the current downturn by creating sustainable jobs and continuing to grow exports in traditional key markets, as well as targeting high growth markets such as the BRIC countries for both exports and inward investment.  The Government has made inroads in bringing about these changes, as well as restoring confidence across enterprise, investors and consumers.  For example, work is advanced within the Department on determining the extent of the restructuring of the county enterprise boards; IDA Ireland has restructured in order that more of its staff are in client-facing jobs, while Enterprise Ireland has made operational a new potential exporters division which will target companies with export potential.  These are just a few examples of the changes being brought about.</p>]
[<p eid="para_151">I take the Deputy's point which is made in good faith.  However, in respect of the Government's capital allocation, there has been a 4% increase in Enterprise Ireland's capital budget for 2012.  I will rush through the figures because I am conscious of the time constraints, but there has been a 10% increase in the number of high potential start-up companies, a 20% increase in the number of innovation partnerships and expenditure of €18 million on the innovation fund.  The key point is that the Government is trying to set down the foundations or the bedrock on which one can sustain jobs over a longer period.  If one considers Sinn Féin's proposals for capital expenditure, they entail borrowing something like €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  It is talking out of both sides of its mouth in this regard — there is a bit of the Tadhg an dá thaobh about it — because, on the one hand, it states it would not pay back moneys to the European institutions from which Ireland has borrowed money while, on the other, it would have no problem in borrowing approximately €1.7 billion from the European Investment Bank.  This does not stack up.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">The Government is trying to create long-term sustainable jobs, but the Deputy is talking about short-term projects based on capital expenditure.  This does not stack up.</p>]
[<p eid="para_157">In fairness to the pensioners who were outside the gates of Leinster House today, if I interpreted the vox pop correctly, the strong message also extended to the amount of money being taken in administration fees.</p>]
[<p eid="para_159">I respectfully ask the Deputy to allow me to answer the question.  The pensioners were as adamant in their opposition to that aspect.  Let us take another look and look at the issue from the perspective of the communication passed between Departments.  However, with all due respect, as the question tabled by the Deputy pertains to capital expenditure of €3.1 billion, he will forgive me if I do not have an exact answer for him on the issue of the pension fund mentioned.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1357">The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of over €50 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a National Support Network has been put in place, headed by a National Director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the Programme.  This support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the Government Departments, agencies and other organisations involved. Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the Programme.</p>, <p eid="para_1358">The latest available data in relation to participation by enterprise in FP7, from 2007 to April, 2011, illustrates the number of participations (applications), number of successful applications, number of specific companies and funding to those companies.</p>, <p eid="para_1359">In the period from the beginning of 2007 when the Seventh Framework Programme began to April this year, 171 companies based in Ireland have had projects approved for funding under the programme. A number of companies are involved in more than one project and the total number of projects approved involving Irish companies in that period is 262. The total amount of funding to Irish based companies in these projects is €74.8 million. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for €55.5 million i.e. 74% of funding to Private Industry with 206 out of the 262 participations in projects. 22 Multinational companies (MNCs) based in Ireland have been approved funding and are involved in 56 approved projects.</p>, <p eid="para_1360">Ireland's overall success rate in FP7 of 23% (percentage of successful Irish applications including industry and academic) remains above the European Member State average of 22.21%.  The funding secured by Irish applicants at 21% (funding secured as percentage of funding requested) is also above the EU average of 20.68%.  The high level of activity of Irish researchers and the Irish success rate ahead of the overall EU average are very positive indications of the prospects for Irish participation in FP7 and are broadly in line with our national targets.</p>, <p eid="para_1361">With regard to the number of projects pending and prospects for a major breakthrough, it is not possible to provide details at this stage.  All major FP7 Calls for 2012 opened in July, 2011 and will close sequentially from September, 2011 to March, 2012.  The next information available from the European Commission with regard to these Calls will be in April, 2012.  There will be one more series of Calls in respect of 2013, before the end of FP7, which is due to conclude at the end of 2013.</p>, <p eid="para_1362">The Commission gives special consideration to the funding of SMEs within FP7, setting a target of at least 15% of the available funding.  Ireland's SME participation remains in line with this target. Indeed, Ireland has the highest SME participation degree of the EU 27 Member States, with 104 per 100,000 SMEs participating in FP7 Themes.</p>, <p eid="para_1363">EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013. It includes the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme which aims to improve the conditions for innovation, such as exchanges of best practices between Member States and actions to improve, encourage and promote innovation in enterprises. It also includes the ICT Policy Support Programme which aims to stimulate the new converging markets for electronic networks and services, media content and digital technologies. The CIP is administered through the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry.</p>]
