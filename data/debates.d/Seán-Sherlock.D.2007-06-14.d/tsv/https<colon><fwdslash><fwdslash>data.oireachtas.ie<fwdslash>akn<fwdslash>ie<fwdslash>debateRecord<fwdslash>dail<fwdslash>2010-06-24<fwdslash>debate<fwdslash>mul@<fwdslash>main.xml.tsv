SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I put a parliamentary question to the Minister on the issue of the dental treatment services scheme asking what constituted an emergency in terms of who could benefit.  In her reply, the Minister stated an emergency is determined by the treating clinician, the contracted general dental practitioner, in agreement with the local HSE.  Dentists throughout the country are trying to provide emergency treatment under this scheme for people with severe disabilities and people with other conditions, such as a person with Alzheimer's disease in a case of which I am aware.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What will the Minister do to ensure vulnerable people will be able to avail of those dental treatment services?  I call for a statement from the Minister or a debate in the House so that we can ensure these services are provided for vulnerable people.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister said in her response that there is provision for emergency treatment, but this treatment is not being approved at local level by the HSE.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	And Fianna Fáil.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Irish people were wrong, were they?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does the Minister of State include fish in this argument?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked about fish because we were on a philosophical debate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is he not now running with the hare and hunting with hounds on that front?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate the time yielded to me by Fine Gael on this issue.  In the short time available to me, I do not intend to go into some of the comments I have just heard.  I have no intention of personalising this issue even though people have referred to me and to my colleagues.  In the view of the Labour Party, the bottom line is whether this legislation is necessary at present, whether it is purely politically motivated or whether it is based on true animal welfare.  In 2007, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which, unless I am mistaken, he placed 27 conditions.  In 2008, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt on which 34 conditions were placed.  In 2009, he issued a licence to the Ward Union Hunt, unless I am mistaken, on which he placed 35 conditions.If one speaks to the rights of man, common sense or a man's motivation, if at that time, he as Minister issued a licence for that hunt to proceed, surely that includes a tacit understanding that he recognised its right to exist as a hunt?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Why is he now moving, in 2010, to revoke the licence?  It is bad legislation——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	—— and the solution proposed by Deputy Higgins in 1997 was a reasoned, rational and responsible approach.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The absolute fundamentalists who exist within this Parliament legislate on an absolutist approach.  It is the wrong way to do so because I foresee trouble ahead in respect of this legislation.  It is the wrong way to legislate.
