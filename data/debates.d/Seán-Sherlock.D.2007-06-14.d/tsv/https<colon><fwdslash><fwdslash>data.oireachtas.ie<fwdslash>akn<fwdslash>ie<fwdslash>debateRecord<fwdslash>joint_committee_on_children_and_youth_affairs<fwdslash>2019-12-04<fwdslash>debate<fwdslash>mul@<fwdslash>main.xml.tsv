SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	Mr. Tennant said that the RTÉ programme made a number of allegations relating to individuals in senior positions in these organisations and their failure to act on information relating to sexual abuse in scout groups across Ireland. Will he expand on that? What exactly does he mean by that statement?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	Mr. Tennant would agree that they are his words. There is an agreement that there is a failure to act on information. In other words, staff or responsible persons in a safeguarding role arguably failed to act on information relating to sexual abuse. Is that the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	No, I would like Mr. Tennant to answer the question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	They are Mr. Tennant's words. Mr. Tennant has to stand over them as chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	Something is fundamental to this. We all understand that there is Scouting Ireland now. We all accept that and have given goodwill to the new procedures and protocols that have been put in place relating to governance. However, Mr. Tennant is here as head of Scouting Ireland. I argue that he must also answer for what happened in the CBSI and the SAI. Our job here is to interrogate the dynamic that led to allegations against persons not being dealt with by the organisation. I am still unclear in my mind as to why, if the Children First guidelines were adopted in 2012, it took a full five years before Scouting Ireland brought in Ian Elliott. During that time, and arguably now, there were persons in the organisation, and I do not know if they are still in the organisation, who took receipt of information from people who were traumatised and those case files were put into a filing cabinet. A review was to have taken place in 2012 but we remain blind about where that review went, how those cases were managed and whether there are people who are part of the 2017 to 2019 review who are taking receipt of the information who are still part of the staff. We want to understand the culture that existed within the organisation. If, as Mr. Tennant suggests, the new broom is sweeping clean, are there people who were in receipt of information in 1987 and 1996, the years which were subject of the "RTÉ Investigates" programme, who are still on the staff and are part of the old culture who continue to be employed? That is the kernel of the matter. Mr. Tennant speaks of Scouting Ireland opening up its processes and creating helplines, but I find it hard to understand how anybody who was dealt with by personnel in 1987 or 1996 might find themselves being dealt with by the same personnel in 2017, 2018 or 2019. Does Mr. Tennant understand how that might look extremely bad for an organisation such as Scouting Ireland? Mr. Tennant is putting a lot of store in the Ian Elliott process. Everyone here accepts Ian Elliott's bona fides, but what they do not buy is that regardless of whether he is a consultant, he is paid by Scouting Ireland to conduct a review and therefore he is an employee of Scouting Ireland. We are questioning the independence of the process. What we are trying to get at is what will arise from the Elliott process when he reports. Regardless of whether he likes it, Mr. Tennant has an idea of how this will play out because he strikes me as someone who has gamed this, which I do not mean in a pejorative sense. He knows how the process is going; we do not. I do not know the contents of Ian Elliott's report. I am very concerned that it will go into the public domain and the people who made complaints in 1987 and 1996 and the people who were the subject of the "RTÉ Investigates" programme will have no justice, recourse or right of reply. Does Mr. Tennant see my point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:00:00+00:00	Mr. Tennant should start with the staff.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:10:00+00:00	I am asking the CEO to answer this question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:10:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Begley. That clarifies that matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:10:00+00:00	Please talk about the 2012 review because I am trying to clarify in my mind what the status of that review is. Correct me if I am wrong but my interpretation of that was Scouting Ireland failed to carry out a scoping exercise to see if further work was required on the files of complaint. My understanding is that was never done, that an undertaking was given to carry out such work and that there are minutes to that effect. What was pertinent there was that Scouting Ireland would carry out the scoping exercise, it would have a statistical analysis for all child protection cases, especially for the files in Mount Melleray. We are being told it is ongoing process and I am confused why that is so because we are now in 2019.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:10:00+00:00	I have a question about the traffic light system. Mr. Tennant said in his opening statement: "Scouting Ireland has always reported any reportable offences". What is the threshold for a reportable offence?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T11:10:00+00:00	I understand the current framework. We would be well versed in Children First, Signs of Safety and all of that but I want to know about happened historically because that is what is pertinent to this hearing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T12:00:00+00:00	I wish to distil this matter down to the "RTÉ Investigates" programme and extrapolate what Deputy Rabbitte has mentioned about the reporting mechanism. If we accept absolutely the bona fides of those who bore witness on that programme and accept them as genuine witnesses, it is arguable that there was a failure of reporting in that instance. That bridges the divide between the historical and the current. If the complaints go back to 1987 and 1996 and people in 2019 are saying there did not appear to be a process in respect of their individual stories, one would have to contend that there is a failure of reporting. Irrespective of the processes Scouting Ireland engaged in in 2012, the distinction it makes between the CBSI, SAI and the creation of Scouting Ireland in 2004, the start of the process, the Children First guidelines and the so-called review in 2012, all of those processes map across the narrative of the individuals who bore witnesses on the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. Having watched that programme, at a human level I would say there was a failure of reporting and a failure to deal properly within whatever protocols Scouting Ireland had designed post 2012 to deal with the trauma suffered by those people. Does Mr. Tennant agree that is the case and that we are still dealing with failures of reporting? We all acknowledge what Scouting Ireland is trying to do with its new governance procedures. We all acknowledge the involvement of those 14,000 families. We represent them also; they live among us in our communities. We are very much aware of the good work that goes on in Scouting Ireland right down to troop level. At the same time, we need to be satisfied beyond any doubt that the system is robust. It is hard to be convinced that it is robust in light of the "RTÉ Investigates" programme.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T12:00:00+00:00	Indeed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T12:00:00+00:00	That is acknowledged, but I am talking about the present day. I am very conscious that certain matters are before the courts or potentially may be, but the stories are in the public domain. What reasonably-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T12:00:00+00:00	I appreciate that, but it is fair to ask this question. Can the representatives of Scouting Ireland state categorically that the process failed then and does so right up to the present day?
