SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In yesterday's edition of the Irish Examiner, the Limerick State solicitor welcomed the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill but said that it would face difficulties.  When asked whether the new law represented a good day’s work, he replied:It remains to be seen, but it is an attempt to address a very serious problem.  And I have no doubt it will be challenged, and I have no doubt there will be difficulties ahead for this legislation.  But something has ... to be done and we just can't roll over and let these people take over our city and our country.He went on to state "the contract is being rewritten by the State on its terms, and I think rightly so".I completely agree with the sentiments expressed by the State solicitor and everyone wants this matter to be dealt with.  The Labour Party differs on this legislation, not on the sentiments regarding the need to tackle organised crime, but on whether the proposal before the House presents a solution to get society out of the morass in which it finds itself.  One's natural instinct is to ensure that every innocent victim will get justice.  One's human instinct is that the only way to handle these criminals is with a short, sharp shock.  The question remains, however, of whether the proposal before us will result in a crack down on organised crime or in legal challenges to the legislation on a number of fronts.  That question is not ideological, it is practical.  Will this legislation assist in the pursuit of criminals in Limerick and west Dublin or will it be challenged by their legal representatives at every turn?  Are we making good law or law that will be challenged due to loopholes?In the Criminal Justice Act 2006, there is already a considerable body of law that should adequately deal with organised crime.  I do not understand why the Government is hell-bent on swamping us with more law, common sense must prevail.  We all want to see these criminals behind bars, and no one in this House would advocate a soft approach that would not see the blight of organised criminal activity wiped out once and for all, but we differ on how this can best be achieved.  It cannot be achieved only through increased legislation, the dogs in the street will tell the Minister that the shortage of resources for the gardaí at the coalface is the most significant impediment to progress in bringing criminals to trial.The idea that we apply more legislation without a comprehensive spend on overtime, surveillance and other enabling mechanisms that would allow gardaí to get on with the job raises serious questions about this Government's strategy to tackle gangland crime.  If common sense was used, the gardaí would have all of the necessary intelligence gathering and surveillance mechanisms at their disposal to hinder any attempt at a crime.  The fact remains that the cutting of overtime for gardaí and the likelihood that there will be a massive cull of more experienced gardaí near the end of their tenure due to the possible taxation of pension lump sums will further exacerbate the situation.  We can have all the law we want but if the experience does not exist in the Garda Síochána to break down these criminal elements, it is all for nothing.  Laws such as that proposed today will matter not one jot if the resources to match are not in place.The first thing that strikes me is that there has been very little change to the definition of a criminal organisation from the 2006 Act except to include a requirement that two of the gang can be involved with a view to act in concert in the commission of an offence.  Has anyone been convicted under section 72 of the 2006 Act that makes it an offence for a person to participate in or contribute to any activity of such an organisation?It is a distraction to introduce a new offence under section 71(a) of directing the activities of a criminal organisation if it has not been possible to prove that a person is a member of a gang.  To introduce a provision to establish the requisite intent is a gimmick.  The new section 72(6) provides that it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that participation or contribution was made with the requisite state of mind if the circumstances under which the relevant act was committed involved the possession by the defendant in the presence of one or more other persons of a balaclava, boiler suit or other means of disguise.  I hope the plumbers and handymen of the country know that wearing a boiler suit is now proof of requisite criminal intent of membership of a criminal organisation.The Minister has argued this legislation is necessary to uphold the rule of law.  Instead, by introducing a system whereby instead of seeking out evidence and putting it before a jury, a garda's opinion will suffice to convict and this can be done before a court sitting without a jury.  Granted, this is not the first time the opinion of a garda has been used to replace the obligation to obtain evidence and allow a court to decide on guilt, the Offences Against the State Act 1972 provided that in prosecutions for membership of a paramilitary organisation, the evidence of a chief superintendent as to that membership could be admissible.  At least the fact that only a very senior garda could give such evidence gave an indication of the seriousness of the matter.  Now, however, a prosecution can rest on the opinion of any garda who has the appropriate expertise.  This is a meaningless criterion because it is difficult to envisage a court refusing to hear the opinion evidence of a trained member of the Garda Síochána on the basis that he or she does not know enough about gangs.The garda's opinion can be based on the fact that the individual in question has previous convictions.  Again, the Minister has already asked us to support the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which will allow gardaí to plant listening devices where there is a suspicion of any arrestable offence.  I have no issue with this.  The stated purpose of that legislation is to obtain evidence with which to pursue gangland crimes but now we find we are not even going to rely on such evidence and instead all we will require is the opinion of a garda.  The Minister stated that such evidence will not go to the guilt of the person in question but there must be a further clarification on that point.Section 71 onwards deals with the Special Criminal Court, the main issue here.  If the perceived problem is that witnesses are afraid to give evidence, and we distinguish between witnesses and those who are members of a jury, surely the Minister should be looking at greater support for witnesses?  Any Bill that states that "it is hereby declared that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to an offence under each of the following provisions" conveys the impression that the current legal remedies are inadequate and must be overhauled.  Are we in a de facto state of emergency?  The Minister in this legislation expressly states that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with criminal organisations.  That is a serious contention that goes to the heart of the common law system and must be further analysed.  No evidence has been presented to demonstrate why the current operation of the courts is inadequate.  The provision in section 8 amends the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to allow certain offences to be tried at the non-jury Special Criminal Court, including the offence of directing a criminal organisation, participation in or contribution to certain activities, and the commission of an offence for a criminal organisation.  We acknowledge the role of the Special Criminal Court in that context and its powers have been extended in this regard.The protection of jury members and witnesses has been suggested as the reason for extending the remit of the Special Criminal Court.  However, as recently as last month, speaking at the annual prosecutors' conference, the Director of Public Prosecutions raised an important point about the participation of the ordinary citizen in the criminal justice system through service on juries.  This, he said, "imports a degree of democratic legitimacy into the system".  This is a point that is worth bearing in mind.  One can infer from this statement that it is in question whether the reality of the DPP referring a case to the Special Criminal Court will actually play out, given the potential doubt as to whether this legislation will stand on its own two feet and withstand any legal challenge down the line.The issue of witness intimidation will not be solved simply by the use of the Special Criminal Court, as witnesses will still need to give evidence in court.  The common sense point of view is that witness protection should be dealt with by instigating measures designed to protect witnesses' identities, if necessary, in addition to Garda protection operations.  This is a more rational approach.The decision on whether to prosecute a case in the Special Criminal Court comes down to one law officer, the DPP.  The existence of total discretion on his or her part as to whether to prosecute and to prosecute in the Special Criminal Court or otherwise is a significant power and must be exercised with great caution.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended to put this power on a statutory footing.  That would be a reasonable approach.  Could we not instead enact a provision within that section along the lines of the UK practice whereby the prosecution may apply for a non-jury trial in cases in which it can show evidence of a real danger of jury tampering?  This would ensure a robust response where there is proof of jury tampering.  The question for this Legislature is whether the provision is a new departure from the norm compared to other common law jurisdictions.  At what point should we depart from a principle enshrined in our Constitution for the pursuance of a goal that can be achieved by means other than fundamentally changing the basis of a criminal trial, namely the right to trial by jury?  The Minister should think long and hard about this provision.I put it to the Minister that the provisions contained within existing legislation should be adequate to deal with the fundamental premise of this Bill; namely, the eradication of organised crime.  There is some presumption that the new provisions are based on the threat posed by criminal gangs.  It conveys an impression that the people engaged in such criminal activity possess a malevolent influence that is beyond the powers of normal court procedures to pursue.  I do not buy into this.  It presumes that we in this House — representatives of the people — no longer have the confidence to curb criminal activity within the normal legal parameters and must embark on some pretence at emergency provisions to placate certain viewpoints.We have developed a new language and rhetoric with regard to organised crime and it needs to be deconstructed.  These people are mere individuals.  They do not live in locations that are beyond the powers of surveillance.  The High Chaparral in Limerick is not a remote location.  People can be photographed and tracked and their movements can be traced.  They are not possessed of special powers and the existing judicial system and corpus of law, coupled with the provision of adequate Garda resources, should be robust enough to bring them to justice.I wonder whether terms such as "organised crime" would ever have crept into our lexicon and would need to be legislated for if the State had provided adequate funding for Garda operations such as Anvil, which allowed the development of surveillance and checkpoints and acted as a thorn in the side of criminals.  The ability of the Garda to tackle crime is severely hampered by a cut in Garda overtime from approximately €120 million last year to €80 million this year.  A total of €21 million has been set aside this year for Operation Anvil, yet the State is spending approximately €12 million on policing north Mayo.  Does the Minister not see an inherent contradiction in his own policy in this regard?I doubt if one extra gangland boss or minion will be brought to justice as a result of the measures contained within the Bill.  We do not argue against any provision that addresses the increasing levels of violence and intimidation directed at witnesses and juries, or the use of the Special Criminal Court for the hearing of particular organised crime offences, but I would like to see some proof of the fact that juries are systematically being intimidated.  Does it really happen?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is one thing to suggest that witnesses are being intimidated, but the suggestion that juries are being systematically intimidated and that this requires a seismic shift away from trial by jury should not be entertained without further analysis.  That a country of this size, which is not densely populated, must resort to such measures suggests that the successful tackling of crime should be predicated on the application of resources and not necessarily on a fundamental change in the law.  If there is proof beyond doubt that juries are being tampered with and intimidated, there are protective instruments that can be applied which are practical and based on a common sense approach.  These are well documented.Under section 7 of the Bill, the opinion of any garda who appears to the court to possess the appropriate expertise will be admissible as evidence of the existence of a criminal organisation.  Under this section, expertise means experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications.The Irish Council for Civil Liberties drafted a paper prior to the instigation of this legislation from which I will quote.  I do not necessarily agree with all the views espoused by the various civil society organisations and I have my own view about the rule of law.  However, there are certain points of law addressed by the ICCL which should be read into the record.  It points out that the opinion of the garda can be informed by the existence of previous convictions of the accused.  The Supreme Court has considered the use of belief evidence and its compatibility with Article 38 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the right to a fair trial.While a garda may claim privilege as to his or her sources when being cross-examined about belief evidence, the Supreme Court is clear that a conviction cannot take place without supportive or corroborative evidence in recognition of the disadvantage that accrues to the defence in a trial.  Moreover, in regard to the rank of garda who is entitled to provide belief evidence, the court has stated that the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 were carefully crafted to ensure belief evidence must come from an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent.  This, the Supreme Court stated, was with a view to establishing trust and credibility as far as possible.  This must be borne in mind in regard to the provisions contained within this Bill.  The UN human rights committee has referred to decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions in assigning cases to the courts not being made public.  To confer further powers on the Director of Public Prosecutions for the hearing of particular organised crime offences in the Special Criminal Court on the basis of his or her total discretion begs the question as to whether the application of increased Garda resources might be a more reasonable solution to the problem which would negate the need for these provisions.On the matter of secret detention hearings, under Part 4 of the Bill, procedures of District Court detention hearings for the purposes of extending the detention of persons under the Offences Against the State Act are altered.  One legal opinion suggests it is contrary to the principles of fair trial that the Bill allows for the hearing to take place in private if the judge considers there may be a risk of prejudice.  In justifying this, it is claimed that members of organised criminal gangs are attending the detention hearings and deciphering the direction of the investigation from the evidence given in court.  However, this provision fundamentally alters the nature of criminal justice in this State, allowing for the judge to hear evidence from a garda of any rank, in private and without legal representation.  This includes answers to questions and a cross-examination without either the defendant, his or her legal representatives or the prosecutor present.  In essence, this means a person can be held without knowledge of the grounds on which the judge is justifying his or her continued detention.  That detention can be justified by secret information from any member of the Garda Síochána, irrespective of his or her expertise or experience.  Regardless of whether or not we are convinced of the necessity for such provisions, the reality is that any criminal lawyer worth his or her salt will most likely be able to identify any number of potential loopholes and, thus, the prospect of a legal challenge.We must also look at our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even where we are seeking to make provision for heinous crimes such as murder, our obligations under the convention remain clear.  We must avoid a situation where a person detained on a murder charge ultimately walks free as a consequence of a challenge to this law under an Article 40 provision.  It does not matter whether or not we are in favour of waiving Article 40 rights in emergency situations.  My point is that we must avoid making bad law or law that will be discovered by a good criminal lawyer to have all types of loopholes.  That is how the State has typically dealt with issues relating to criminality heretofore.  Criminal lawyers have always been able to find loopholes that have allowed people to walk free in certain circumstances.  If we are to tackle this problem once and for all, we must make robust and effective law that will not be subjected to future challenge at a supranational court, as Deputy Charles Flanagan observed.We intend to propose several amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  Practical changes can be made that will not alter the Minister's modus operandi in seeking to tackle organised crime.  In particular, we must ensure there is protection for witnesses and that jury tampering does not take place.  I understand the courts in the United Kingdom have found that the state is obliged to take particular steps to protect certain vulnerable categories of people such as witnesses.  We are not so naive as to suggest there is an onus on the State to prevent every possibility of violence, but where individuals are exposed to threats to their lives, the State will, in certain circumstances, be obliged to provide police protection.  In order to fulfil these obligations, we must ensure effective measures are taken to thwart attempts to trace witnesses and collaborators of justice by criminal organisations.  Several procedures can be put in place to ensure juries are not tampered with and that witnesses are afforded adequate protections.  These must be brought forward as practical measures in line with the implementation of this legislation.Any procedural rules that are enacted to protect the rights of witnesses must be formulated taking into account the need to safeguard the criminal trial process.  Measures which could be made available to assist witnesses include anonymity before, during and after the criminal trial.  However, this should be an exceptional measure and should be set down in law so that procedures are available for the defence to challenge the need for anonymity.A cause of concern in the criminal justice system is the considerable delay in court proceedings in the State.  If court proceedings could be expedited in a timely fashion, this would offset the risk of any potential tampering with juries.  We should not set about fundamentally changing our common law system when we could instead tackle criminals with robust measures through adequately funded and effective policing mechanisms.  While we agree with the tenor of the Bill in terms of what it seeks to achieve, we are of the view that it requires amendment.
