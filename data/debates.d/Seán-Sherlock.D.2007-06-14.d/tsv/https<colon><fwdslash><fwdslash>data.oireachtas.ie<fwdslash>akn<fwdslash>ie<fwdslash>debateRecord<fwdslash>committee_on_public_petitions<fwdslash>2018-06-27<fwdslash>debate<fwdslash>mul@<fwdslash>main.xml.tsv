[<p eid="para_6">I have turned off my own phone. The usual rules on phones apply. Apologies have been received from Deputy Dara Murphy and Senator Colette Kelleher. We note that Senator Jerry Buttimer is currently in the Seanad. I propose that we go into private session to deal with certain matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_7">We will now consider the public petitions. The first is Petition No. P0008/17. It is proposed that the committee forward a copy of the latest reply from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the petitioner with a copy of the Mediation Act 2017 and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_8"> The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0006/18. The decision of the committee is to forward a copy of the reply from Dublin City Council to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_11">Thank you, Deputy. I am going to move on. The final petition for consideration is Petition No. P00024/18. This is in respect of a two-tier system whereby those who can afford a newer car pay less motor tax. This relates to the pre-2008 legislation cars subject to the old regime on motor tax. The committee is proposing that we forward a copy of the reply from the Office of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and close the petition. I need your agreement on that. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_16">Thank you, Deputy Cassells. We have agreed to forward a copy of the reply from the office of the Minister to the petitioner and we are closing the petition. The point is made. There is sympathy for the case being made in this instance by the petitioner on the basis that 2008 was such an arbitrary year. Not everyone has been in a position since then to change or upgrade their vehicles. Many people are still driving a 2008 vehicle or a pre-2008 vehicle and find themselves in a different motor tax band. There is a difficulty therein. There is sympathy but in terms of dealing with the petition we have decided to send a copy of the reply from the Minister to the petitioner.</p>]
[<p eid="para_19">You will be riding this horse in the Committee of Public Accounts as well, Deputy. The Committee of Public Accounts is dealing with that issue. I do not think there is any suggestion at this stage that we take it further.</p>]
[<p eid="para_21">Thank you, Deputy. Thank you all for your attendance at the meeting today.</p>]
