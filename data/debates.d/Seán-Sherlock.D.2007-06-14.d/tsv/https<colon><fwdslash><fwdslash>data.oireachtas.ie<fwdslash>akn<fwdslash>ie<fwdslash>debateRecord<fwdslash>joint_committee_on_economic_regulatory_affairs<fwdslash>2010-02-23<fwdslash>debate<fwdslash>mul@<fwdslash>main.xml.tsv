[<p eid="para_31">I will be blunt.  When I read sentences such as, "It does not permit stakeholders an opportunity to show flexibility in the application of regulatory instruction or a measurement of appropriateness in its interpretation", I can understand it but will the delegates give a layman's view?  We have had representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions before us and will receive representations from managers shortly.  We are trying to listen to as many stakeholders as possible.  We are trying to get a view on section 35, for example, and the current regulatory regime.  The delegates have spoken about opportunities to show flexibility.  In the context of Irish legislation, does this mean amending section 35 of the Credit Union Act?  When speaking about the appropriateness of interpretation, does this refer to section 35 or something completely different?  The two issues in which I have a particular interest concern section 35 of the Act and the current regulatory regime.  There is one school of thought which suggests it must be under the auspices of the regulator's office under the umbrella of the Central Bank.  However, there is another school of thought which suggests it should be a function of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or other such Department.  I am trying to get the delegates' view and ascertain whether we should be moving towards the Australian model.  Are we okay where we are?</p>, <p eid="para_32">If CUNA is the body for credit unions in North America, I presume the model in place there is not dissimilar to the one in place here.  Will the delegates explain the differences from the punter's perspective?  In the Irish context the guy on the street will use a credit union to take out a car loan.  Does the credit union in North America serve a similar function, or is it a more extensive function more like a banking facility?  If that is the case, is CUNA Mutual Europe's aim for us to move in that direction?  Where does it see itself relative to the ILCU and other representative credit union organisations?</p>]
