SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2016-01-26T17:20:00+00:00	I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who apologises for being unable to attend this afternoon. The Exchequer provides funding supports to the four regional airports in Donegal, Kerry, Waterford and Knock under the regional airports programme operated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Over the past decade, Knock has received almost €21 million in Exchequer support in operational and capital grants under the OPEX and CAPEX funding schemes administered by the Department. In August last year, the European Commission gave its approval for the Department's new regional airports programme, which takes account of the recommendations of the Knock study group and the subsequent decision by Government to continue funding supports to the four regional airports. That decision recognised that the regional airports should be given the opportunity beyond 2014 to grow to a viable, self-sustaining position, particularly considering the contribution that they make to their respective regional and local economies. This was also acknowledged in the new national aviation policy that was published last August. The Deputy will be aware that, under new EU state aid guidelines of 2014, the maximum level of aid permissible for capital projects at airports with fewer than 1 million passengers per annum is 75%. The EU guidelines recognise, however, that airports in this category may face difficulties in sourcing the balance of at least 25%. Subject to a case-by-case assessment, an aid rate in excess of 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances. In such a scenario, the Commission has indicated that a business case justifying any proposed higher aid rate would have to be approved by it and must be able to demonstrate the airport's inability to proceed with the proposed investment at the 75% aid rate. Under a new aspect of the regional airports programme called the public policy remit, all of the regional airports, including Knock, are eligible for grant assistance up to 90% towards the cost of capital investments in the areas of safety and security. There is also a PPR scheme which assists with grants of up to 100% of the operational costs of the airports in these two areas. Last year, under the first year of the new programme, Knock received almost €1.2 million in grant supports from the Department and the latter has already begun engaging again with all four airports on their future requirements for capital grant assistance. The Minister is, of course, aware that Knock has indicated that it will require a higher grant rate than the maximum 75% permitted under the EU guidelines for certain major capital projects that are planned at the airport over the coming years. The ongoing engagement with Knock continues to address this issue, as well as the funding available to the airport under the new PPR schemes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-01-26T17:20:00+00:00	I note the points the Deputy has made. I do not have an answer to that question, but I am sure departmental officials and the Minister's staff are watching proceedings and I am sure the Deputy will approach the Minister directly on this issue. For the purpose of replying, I will reiterate that I do not think it is a case of ruling out the possibility of 90% funding. I do not think that was explicitly stated in the answer I gave. I will read again from the answer:The Minister is, of course, aware that Knock has indicated that it will require a higher grant rate than the maximum 75% permitted under the EU guidelines for certain major capital projects that are planned at the airport over the coming years.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-01-26T17:30:00+00:00	I am taking this issue on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. I understand that Deputy Dowds has been very proactive on this issue for quite some time and I thank him for raising the matter. I understand that the background to this issue arises from the concerns of local residents living in the immediate area in relation to the use of surrounding residential roads by heavy goods vehicles and their wish to see a 3.5 tonne vehicle weight restriction applied to Kennelsfort Road for traffic management purposes. While I cannot comment on the specifics of any weight restriction currently applying to the Kennelsfort Road, decisions in respect of the application of such weight restrictions are entirely a matter for the relevant local authority. In this instance, and based on the intervention of Deputy Dowds, that would appear to be South Dublin County Council, though my script states it is Dublin City Council. The Minister does not have any role to play in such decisions. However, should South Dublin County Council decide to apply such a weight restriction on Kennelsfort Road, this would be indicated by the use of the appropriate vehicle weight limit sign. The legislative basis underpinning the erection of such regulatory signage is provided for under road traffic legislation with which all local authorities must comply. Also, further details relating to regulatory vehicle weights signage are set out for local authorities in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's 2010 traffic signs manual. The Road Traffic (Signs) (Amendment) Regulations 2012, SI 331 of 2012, and the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2012, SI 332 of 2012, provide the legislative basis for weight restrictions on vehicles entering a road and associated signage. Relevant signage in this regard includes regulatory upright sign RUS 015, which is used in traffic management and road safety issues such as prohibiting heavy vehicles from using residential roads, and RUS 053, which is used in cases of entry restrictions relating to the structural integrity of the road network, including bridges. Sign RUS 015, giving maximum design gross vehicle weight, is used at the entrance of a road and provides that drivers of vehicles whose design gross vehicle weight exceeds the weight specified on the sign are prohibited from proceeding beyond that point except where it is necessary for a vehicle to gain access to, or egress from, premises accessible only from that road. RUS 053 indicates that the driver of a vehicle exceeding the design gross vehicle weight displayed on the sign shall not proceed beyond it. There are no exceptions to this regulation. The entry restrictions associated with traffic signs RUS 015 and RUS 053 apply to all vehicles, including buses, which exceed the design gross vehicle weight specified on either sign. Any decision by a local authority to apply such restrictions would have to take account of whether the road in question is used as part of a bus route. In conclusion, individual local authorities are best placed to assess the particular local vehicle weight requirements, based on either road safety or traffic management grounds, which should apply to a particular individual road. However, as previously mentioned, if such weight limit controls are applied, local authorities must erect signage that is in full compliance with regulations. The enforcement of road traffic regulations governing vehicle weight limits on any particular public road is a matter for An Garda Síochána.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-01-26T17:40:00+00:00	How do I respond with a negative after that? The Deputy has raised some questions which are on the record of the House. I will endeavour to speak directly to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, about the specific questions posed. I hope officials in the Minister's Department are listening to this and that they will reply directly to the Deputy. However, I assure the Deputy that I will raise this directly with the Minister, who is currently in the Seanad dealing with the Road Traffic Bill. I acknowledge the great work of Deputy Dowds and the fastidious and meticulous way in which he has always dealt with issues relating to his constituents. We all hope we will be back in the House. Deputy Dowds has made an outstanding contribution to this House and to the Parliamentary Labour Party. We wish him the best on his next path in life, whatever pathway that is.
