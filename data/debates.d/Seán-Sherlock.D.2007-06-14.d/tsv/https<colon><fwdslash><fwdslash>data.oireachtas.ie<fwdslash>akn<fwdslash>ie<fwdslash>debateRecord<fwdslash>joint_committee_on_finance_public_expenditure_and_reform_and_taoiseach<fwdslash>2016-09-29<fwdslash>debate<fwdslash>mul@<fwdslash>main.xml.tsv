SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:10:00+01:00	I thank the Minister of State and his officials for coming before the joint committee. The flood risk management schemes in Mallow and Fermoy were both very successful. The Minister of State has said the final accounts will be agreed for the Mallow south and Fermoy south schemes in 2016. What is the full projected cost in 2017 of the two schemes?  On the intervention of the Minister of State regarding the memorandum of understanding which has now been signed with the OPW, I know for a fact that insurance providers represented by Insurance Ireland are flatly stating they will not provide flood insurance in the Munster Blackwater region which includes Fermoy and Mallow. What is the response of the Minister of State? If both areas have a flood risk management scheme which has been tested and proved to work and be effective and certain component members of Insurance Ireland state they will not provide insurance in certain parts of the Munster Blackwater region, we have a serious issue. I would like to hear the response of the Minister of State.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:10:00+01:00	What about the Insurance Ireland issue?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:10:00+01:00	To be helpful, the demountable flood defences have been proved to work and there is robust engineering evidence of this. The man and woman on the street have seen it for themselves. To be helpful to him, I suggest to the Minister of State that he should not be led a merry dance by Insurance Ireland because it speaks for the big global insurers and I do not want to name names. Even if there is a memorandum of understanding, the question is what is the extent of its power? I have proof which I will furnish to the Minister of State, through the Irish Brokers Association which tells us people are being refused flood insurance in towns such as Fermoy and Mallow, notwithstanding the fact that there are demountable flood defences. I will come back to the Minister of State, but only if I get a sense from him that he will use the full weight of his office to lean on the insurance providers because the decisions taken by the insurance industry are not necessarily taken in Dublin. They are normally taken in Switzerland, London or any of the global capitals. If the reinsurers or underwriters are not covering the risk, with all due respect, the Minister of State is at nothing. The people of Carrigtwohill regard Barryscourt Castle as a major resource. Will the Minister of State give a definitive date as to when it will open?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:10:00+01:00	What do I tell a business on Bridge Street in Mallow or a business in Fermoy? The response of the Minister of State suggests Insurance Ireland is looking for bells and whistles, but it should take at face value the word of the OPW if it states the demountable defences work because, being the robust organisation that it is, it will not state this unless they absolutely work. We have all seen that they work. If Insurance Ireland is looking for conditions to be met before it will insure, I suggest the Minister of State not be led on a merry dance by it. It is about having teeth in the game.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:20:00+01:00	My final questions are very specific. We need a definitive date on when Barryscourt Castle will reopen. I would like to know the operating budget for Doneraile Court. What is the headline budget for Anne's Grove Gardens, a recent enough addition? I know a notification has gone out on opening the facility but what is the specific date on which it will be open to the public?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:20:00+01:00	I suppose I am asking if there is a budget line.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-29T10:20:00+01:00	I appreciate that. To be helpful to the Chairman, I listed three specific facilities and if I could get a note from the Minister of State on the operating budget for Doneraile Court, the works required for Barryscourt and the budget therein and the budget required for Anne's Grove its prospective opening time, I would be happy to leave it at that.
