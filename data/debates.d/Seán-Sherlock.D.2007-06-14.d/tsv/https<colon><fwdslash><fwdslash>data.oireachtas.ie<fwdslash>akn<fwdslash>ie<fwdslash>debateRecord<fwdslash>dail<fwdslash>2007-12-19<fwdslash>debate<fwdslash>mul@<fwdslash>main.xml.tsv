[<p eid="para_768">I noted with interest the contribution of the Minister for State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to this debate last night.  Not once did he mention the word "pharmacist" or even acknowledge the problem that exists for the IPU.  He stated: "the Bill before us today is, in effect, championing price fixing, which is a serious crime carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years".  This gives rise to the question of whether the Minister of State has decided by implication that the general medical scheme as it stands is administered by pharmacists in a manner that is not in keeping with the law.  He must clarify his opinion.</p>, <p eid="para_769">The current impasse between the IPU and the HSE is characterised by the latter seeking to enforce its will on the former without even the courtesy or corporate social responsibility of allowing negotiations.  The very nature of this unilateral decision to slash the payments made by the HSE to pharmacists for the purchase of medicines will undermine the viability of pharmacies everywhere.</p>, <p eid="para_770">I do not speak for the large multiples which will soak up the reductions in margins without pain but for community based and family run pharmacies which have a wealth of knowledge of their clients and are acutely aware of the intergenerational health issues that run within families.  The vast majority of these pharmacies are located in rural and marginal areas.  In my constituency of Cork East, towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Youghal, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Midleton are characterised by the presence of independently owned pharmacists who rely heavily on the general medical scheme.  I speak for those who may have taken over a pharmacy from a parent and are carrying on a proud tradition.  They deserve the opportunity to at least negotiate their position.</p>, <p eid="para_771">This move by the HSE is dolled up as reform but we can see it for the bullying tactic it is.</p>]
[<p eid="para_773">If the HSE had the reforming zeal it purports to have, it would have consulted the pharmacists prior to any unilateral move.  That is why we are seeking to ensure that by amending the Competition Act, organisations such as the IPU will at least have the right to negotiate a position that will not leave them stranded on this or any other issue.</p>, <p eid="para_774">If the concepts of engagement and social partnership are to mean anything, the Government will at least afford them that right.  This unilateral action by the Health Service Executive, HSE, runs contrary to long-held beliefs that the primacy of negotiation with any representative body is paramount.  The Labour Party seeks to defend that right.</p>]

[<p eid="para_1134">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to speak about the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious delay in granting permission to St. Mary's community school, Buttevant, County Cork, to build a new school to provide for an increase in the student population.</p>, <p eid="para_1135">This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years.  It was last raised by my predecessor and late father in April 2007.  As yet, no progress has been made in this regard.  The staff and pupils, as well as the people of Buttevant, have been waiting for ten years for this project to be expedited and I now call on the Minister to tell the people of Buttevant when she intends to notify County Cork Vocational Education Committee of her approval of the new school.</p>, <p eid="para_1136">When I was a member of Cork County Council, it took a proactive decision to rezone lands for the purpose of designating an educational site to provide for this school.  At present, the school principal and those who are involved in the school only seek the appointment of a design team to enable them at least to move to a stage from which progress can be made on this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_1137">The school itself is characterised by buildings which in some instances date back to pre-Famine times.  As the enrolment has increased from 182 last year to 194 this year, is set to rise by at least a further ten next year and is increasing on a yearly basis, the people of Buttevant and the school authorities wonder when the Department will expedite this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_1138">The layouts of the buildings are of a very poor standard and design because the building is not a purpose-built school.  The staffroom is very cramped and there are no sporting facilities.  The school is obliged to use the local GAA facilities for physical education and other sporting uses.  As the site has been purchased on foot of the rezoning, that step of the process has been undertaken.  I call for some progress on this matter and for the Minister for Education and Science at least to deliver on a promise and commitment to the people of Buttevant because the population of Buttevant and the school's catchment area is increasing yearly.  It is anticipated that Buttevant's location on a main national primary route will make it a far more attractive place to live in future and the needs of the local secondary school on a new greenfield site must be met in that context.</p>, <p eid="para_1139">This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years and the people of Buttevant and of north Cork wish to see some progress in this regard.  I ask the Minister to take this on board and expedite the matter and bring it to design stage in 2008.  I will conclude by wishing the Acting Chairman, the staff and Members all the best for the season and for 2008.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1147">That is a virtual cut and paste of the answer given to my predecessor in April 2007.</p>]
