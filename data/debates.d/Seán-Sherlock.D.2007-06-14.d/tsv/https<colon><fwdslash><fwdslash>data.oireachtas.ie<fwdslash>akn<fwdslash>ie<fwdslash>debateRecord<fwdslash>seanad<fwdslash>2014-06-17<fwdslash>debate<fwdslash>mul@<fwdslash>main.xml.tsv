SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-06-17T16:00:00+01:00	I do not support the amendment. The primary objective of the Companies Bill is to be business-friendly and to reduce red tape or unnecessary regulation where possible. Supporting this amendment would result in the introduction of an onerous regulation which would disproportionately affect business and will fail to adequately address the cardinal problem which the accountancy bodies allude to. New regulations should only be introduced where there is clear evidence of market failure or very damaging consumer harm. That has not been established factually as being the position here. We must bear in mind that it is also possible that new layers of regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation. When the matter was reviewed by the Department at the time of drafting, the conclusion was there was no case for introducing a system of regulation for the profession generally. On the contrary, it was felt that introducing such a system would put at risk the flexibility of the profession and its ability to respond to client needs, be it in traditional areas such as tax advice or management accounts, or in emerging fields such as succession planning.Regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation. Having examined the issue from the standpoint of the principles of better regulation, the Competition Authority concluded there was no public interest case requiring legal protection of the term "accountant". That is the Government position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:05:00+01:00	For the record of this House, we note the concerns expressed by accountancy bodies. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has agreed to undertake an assessment of the issues by consulting with key stakeholders such as the professional bodies mentioned by Senator Quinn, consumer representatives, small business representatives, regulators, the Revenue Commissioners, the Companies Registration Office and other official bodies with an interest. It is not as if we are ignoring issues, it is merely the case that for the purposes of this Bill we do not support the amendment. This is not to say that there is not an ongoing consultation process with the very bodies Senator Quinn mentioned.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:05:00+01:00	I will take the sections together.I have previously advocated the view that it is within the remit of the accountancy profession to engage in an awareness campaign informing the public of the advantages of engaging the services of only fully qualified and properly regulated accountants. Similar public awareness campaigns have been run, for instance, in relation to electrical contractors, and they have proven successful. It is worth restating that the primary objective of the Companies Bill is to ensure that Ireland has a company law code that will enhance its international competitiveness, help improve ordinary business and make it easier for companies throughout the country to establish and operate. On a technical drafting matter, this amendment would be ineffective, as it would impact on others - for example, as the Senator has mentioned, those practising as accounting technicians or as turf accountants. It also fails to cover all details which would be required in terms of qualifications, standards and so on. For those reasons, it would not be appropriate to support the amendment. The accountancy profession is in general adaptable and agile, and is able to respond to new market opportunities and directions. That is to a great extent because it is not tied down by layers of regulation. There are detailed statutory provisions relating to auditing and, to a lesser extent, insolvency practice. The Competition Authority holds the view that this is the way things should stay. Additionally, my Department is committed to reducing the level of Government-imposed red tape on business. To this end, significant progress has been made by my Department in reducing administrative burdens by 25% in areas including company law. If this amendment is supported without proper consideration being given to its impact, it could have an adverse consequence for business by creating an additional layer of regulation and, in doing so, would fail to advance consumer protection. For those reasons, we do not support the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	The section is partly new and derives from a wide range of statutory provisions, including section 376 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 13(1) and 13(2) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982 and various statutory instruments. Provisions in secondary legislation relating to thoroughbred horse breeding and providers of investment in loan finance have been brought into primary legislation. I do not know if the Senator refers specifically to that industry. Provision is made for the Minister to make further exceptions to the 20-partner limit by order in consultation with the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. Exceptions are made in respect of limited partnerships and investment limited partnerships. I am not sure if that fully addresses the point and perhaps I am missing a trick in terms of the Senator's argument.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	It is existing law and as the Minister has the power to change it for individual cases, flexibility is built in.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	Forgive me for setting the debate back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	We are on the right side of it. Government amendment No. 2:In page 67, line 34, to delete “and” and substitute the following:“(f) the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013; and”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendment is to incorporate the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 in the definition of prior Companies Acts in the Bill. All provisions of this Act will be carried over into the Companies Bill 2012.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:15:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment to section 5 on Report Stage to reference any provision of a former enactment in subsection (3), and the purpose would be to further clarify the section rather than make any substantive change. Question put and agreed to.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:20:00+01:00	I note the Senator's points. There is general agreement that the 18-month period was the best period. We will aim to have a specific date as soon as possible, which I appreciate does not give the Senator too much comfort. There is a recognition of the need to aim for a specific date as soon as possible and we are very cognisant of that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:20:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to ensure consistency with the model constitutions. For example, the model constitution of Schedule 1 contains a clause to the effect that the liability of its members is limited and the amendment ensures that both the section and Schedule 1 are uniform. The other amendments grouped under this section aim to achieve the same result with regard to the section and Schedule reflecting one another.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:20:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to provide an exception from the prohibition that neither a body that is not a company nor an individual shall carry on any trade, profession or business under a name which includes as its last part the word "limited" or the words "company limited by shares" for industrial and provident societies, as initiated.Only volume 1 companies are permitted to end their name with "Limited". This amendment is necessary to provide for the approximately 900 industrial and provident societies in existence which have the word "Limited" in their name. I am also considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide that the provisions of this section will not apply to an external company.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:25:00+01:00	These amendments are typographical in nature and do not have a substantive impact on the Bill.Government amendment No. 8:In page 86, line 27 to delete "therein" and substitute the following:"therein;(i) any copy of a winding up order in respect of the company;(j) any copy of an order for the dissolution of the company on a winding up;(k) any return by the liquidator of the final meeting of the company on a winding up;(l) any notice of the appointment of a liquidator in a voluntary winding up of the company.".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:25:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the provisions of regulation 4 of SI No. 163/1973 - that is, European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973 - into the Bill and to impose a publication notification requirement in respect of the few items listed in the amendment. These are: any copy of a winding up order in respect of the company; any copy of an order for the dissolution of the company on a winding up; any return by the liquidator of the final meeting of the company on a winding up; and any notice of the appointment of a liquidator in a voluntary winding up of a company. This section provides that the registrar shall publish in the CRO Gazette notice of the delivery to or the issue by the Registrar of certain documents and particulars listed. The section requires such a notice to be published within ten days after the date of the relevant delivery or issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:30:00+01:00	I propose to respond to the two amendments together. I am not in favour of them. I draw the House's attention to section 38(2), which reads: "Nothing in subsection (1) shall relieve a company from any duty or obligation under any enactment or the general law." This safeguard prevents an argument to the contrary being made. In such circumstances, amendment No. 9 is already provided for in the Bill. Amendment No. 10 is misconceived in law. It is contrary to the Constitution and the principles of natural justice generally to provide that, in the case of a clash of "rights and privileges", a natural human being's rights and privileges must always take precedence over those of a company. Companies are legal persons and, as such, have a number of rights that must be protected. Therefore, I am not in favour adopting these amendments. I will avail of this opportunity to clarify that section 38 grants private limited companies the full legal capacity to enter into transactions and undertake business activities. Section 39 provides that a company, should it wish to do so, may authorise a person to bind it, that is, act on behalf of its board of directors. The provision contained in section 38 is new while section 39 is drawn from section 6(3) of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973, although this is not a direct re-enactment. Section 38 is modelled on section 16(1) of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993. The rationale for the innovation in section 38 is to prevent its use in the avoidance of corporate contractual responsibility to the detriment of a particular creditor. Under current law, if a company does something outside the scope of its objects, it has committed an ultra vires act. This means that, if a company has entered into a contract and is subsequently found to have acted outside its powers, that contract will be deemed to have never existed. This section reflects the reality that 90% of Irish companies are closely held ones, that is, companies in which the shareholders and management often consist of the same people. Thus, in circumstances where the demarcation of management and shareholders is virtually non-existent, the doctrine of ultra vires has little meaning. I am satisfied that section 38 will add certainty to the law and is to be welcomed. As a result of this provision, any contract that a company enters into will be legally binding on that company. Therefore, I am satisfied that the introduction of section 38 does not mean that the company somehow can usurp the human rights of any person or ignore its legal obligations. A company is a legal person that has rights and duties of its own. It is not possible or proper to insert a provision that would undermine these rights.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:35:00+01:00	In regard to amendment No. 10, suggesting we ought to set out in statute that a person's rights would, regardless of circumstances, always take precedence over a company's rights is misconceived in law. Like human beings, companies have rights which must be protected. For example, a company can enjoy the right of freedom of speech and be afforded a nationality. While I appreciate that this section has been interpreted as somehow strengthening the corporate personality at the expense of human beings, that simply is not the case. It is not appropriate to attempt to introduce a hierarchy between various rights in statute law. It is a matter for the courts to interpret the facts of a particular case and apply the law. It ought to be appreciated that rights are not limited and that it is normal that different rights conflict with one another. It is on that basis that I cannot accept amendment No. 10.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:35:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment to this section on Report Stage in order to bring it into line with the Powers of Attorney Act 1996 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:35:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to clarify that where a company is availing of an agent for the purposes of the Companies Registered Office, such an agent must be a company registered in Ireland. This section requires a company to have a registered office within the State to which all communications must be addressed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:35:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment to this section on Report Stage to provide that credit institutions and insurance companies are compulsorily required to register as designated activity companies. This is necessary as these companies cannot under section 18 of the Bill be private companies limited by shares.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	Given the number of sections in this Bill at Committee Stage and the fact that I must stand up and down considerably for them, would anybody be offended if I remain seated? I hope my request is not a breach of protocol.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	Thank you.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	Amendment No. 13 has been grouped with amendment No. 14. The purpose of these amendments is to correct an oversight in relation to companies that re-register as designated activity companies. The amendment will preserve the model of regulation of Table A to the Companies Act 1963, for companies limited by shares. Table A will continue to apply to these companies save to the extent that it is contrary to mandatory provisions in the Bill. Government amendment No. 14:In page 104, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(9) If, by reason of section 58, an existing private company was, immediately before the making by the company of an application under subsection (3), governed (in whole or in part) by the regulations contained in Table A, then for the purposes of this section and in addition to the other cases where their continuance in force for a particular purpose is provided for by this Chapter, those regulations shall, despite the repeal of the Act of 1963, continue in force and upon the issue of the aforementioned certificate of incorporation the articles of the designated activity company shall be deemed to comprise the whole of those regulations or, as the case may be, to include the parts concerned of those regulations, but—(a) this is save to the extent that those regulations are inconsistent with a mandatory provision;(b) those regulations may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which the designated activity company’s articles are permitted by Part 16 to be altered or added to; and(c) references in those regulations to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act.(10) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of that subsection, the regulations referred to in subsection (9) shall be interpreted according to the form in which they existed on the date of repeal of the Act of 1963.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to remove the discretion from the private limited company in relation to its duty to require a member, or transferee of shares, to furnish the company with information as to the beneficial ownership of any shares. This subsection (7), like Regulation 7 of Part I of Table A of the Companies Act 1963, provides that a company is not bound by or compelled to recognise the beneficial ownership of its shares even if it has notice of it. As the Bill stands, subsection 7 goes on to provide that unless its constitution provides otherwise, subsection 6 does not preclude a company from requesting information as to the beneficial ownership of shares when reasonably required.SECTION 69
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to deal with previously allotted shares. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has indicated that it may need to further refine the wording.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:40:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to clarify the position with regard to a resulting credit when there is a reduction in the nominal value of a share.These amendments bring the provisions into line with existing law. The proposed amendment also satisfies the requirements of the fourth company law directive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:45:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to re-enact the existing law. It is public companies only, not private companies, that will have an official seal which is a facsimile of the common seal and which has on its facsimile the word "securities" or the Irish language equivalent. This amendment is necessary to revert to the existing law. Amendment agreed to. Section 108, as amended, agreed to.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:45:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the wording might need to be refined to clarify that "properly prepared" refers to statutory financial statements and not also to the "initial" and "interim" financial statements.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:50:00+01:00	The amendments amend the definition of "distribution" by eliminating as an exception the reduction of the liability of shareholders. The reduction in the liability of shareholders will, therefore, now fall within the definition of a "distribution" and be subject to the normal rules of requiring distributable reserves. This is consistent with section 117(3) which provides that a company shall not apply an unrealised profit in paying up debentures or any amounts unpaid on any of its issued shares.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:50:00+01:00	The purpose of amendments Nos. 26 and 27 is to include all revaluation reserves in the definition of "relevant sum". This is consistent with EU directives which provide that revaluation reserves may be capitalised. The purpose is to correct an inconsistency in the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:50:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendments is to clarify that a company secretary has the skills or resources necessary to discharge his or her statutory and other duties. As the provision stands, it could be interpreted incorrectly to prevent the outsourcing of legal services. This is not intended.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:50:00+01:00	I am not in favour of adopting the amendments which propose unduly oppressive conditions on legitimate businesses. The suggestion that a majority of directors be EEA resident might particularly dissuade foreign direct investment companies from doing business in Ireland.This is bad for Ireland and Irish commerce generally. Second, section 137, which re-enacts existing law, ensures that companies that do not have at least one director who is resident in an EEA state must put in place a bond in the prescribed form that becomes payable to a person nominated by the registrar or the Revenue Commissioners. The purpose of the bond is to discharge any fine imposed on the company in respect of an offence committed by it and prosecutable by the registrar and-or for the purposes of discharging certain fines and penalties imposed on it by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The moneys can also be used to cover expenses that are reasonably incurred in the collection of said penalties. The bond cannot be used for any other purpose. Therefore, the amendments proposed do not achieve any legitimate policy goal. Their sole effect is to create an arbitrary restriction on non-EEA companies trying to do business in Ireland. It is on that basis that I do not support the amendments. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T16:55:00+01:00	These amendments propose to insert the words "managed and controlled" into this section of the Bill. The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax-resident in Ireland. As Minister of State in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance. Additionally, the proposed amendments are illegal both under EU and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law on freedom of establishment, which is a core aspect of EU law. Compliance with this is closely monitored by the European Commission. Ireland has recently been required by the Commission to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the EU and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland.  Furthermore, this proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is completely unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and Ireland's reputation internationally so it is on that basis that I am not in favour of accepting the amendments. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:00:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendment is to delete language which could be interpreted in a discriminatory manner. This refers to the somewhat outdated term “unsound mind”. While the term is legally sound, it does not represent everyday language and understanding of situations where a director is no longer, for medical reasons, capable of fulfilling his or her functions as a company director. The wording proposed is more in line with the wording used in the Employment Equality Act. This section provides that the office of director is vacated if a director becomes bankrupt or disqualified and, unless the constitution provides otherwise, where the director resigns, can no longer be reasonably regarded as possessing an adequate decision making capacity, is restricted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an indictable offence, or is absent for six months without permission. This section substantially imports model regulations 91 of Part I of Table A of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1963. A new requirement that the conviction must give rise to a sentence and to a term of imprisonment - actual or suspended - has been inserted. I pay tribute to Mr. Jim Breen from Cycle Against Suicide, who brought the issue to our attention. On foot of representations made specifically by him and people close to him, we sought to change the wording and reflect language that is more caring and apt for the society we live in. On the basis of some consciousness-raising, we introduced this amendment. I acknowledge the work of our officials in bringing it forward. It represents a positive change in how we use language about issues such as this. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:00:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to grant the Minister powers to make regulations in regard to the non-disclosure of residential addresses on the public register kept by the registrar. In certain limited circumstances, company officers will be granted an exemption from listing their residential address on the public register. Such addresses will be kept separately by the registrar who, in turn, will be granted powers to release such addresses to relevant authorities, for example, the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Síochána. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure competitiveness as certain company officers may be reluctant to locate in Ireland unless they are, for legitimate reasons, given an exemption in respect of publication of their residential addresses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:00:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendment is to reflect existing law and to provide certainty. As the Bill stands, the words “unless the contrary is proved” could lead to uncertainty and could be interpreted as permitting deemed service of notice to be set aside at a later date, which could cause uncertainty in respect of business conducted at every relevant meeting.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:00:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendments is to address any ambiguity as to the part to which these provisions apply. This section concerns unanimous written resolutions and is partially new. Unanimous written resolutions are permitted as the default, that is to say, there is no need for the constitution to allow them. The section implements the recommendations in the first report of the Company Law Review Group with regard to written resolutions and procedures for their execution.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:00:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that there can be a sole member company notwithstanding a stipulation in the constitution that there be two members or a greater number. This will ensure any confusion is avoided.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:10:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the subsection relating to the serving of notice on members applies where a provision of the Bill so requires or authorises a notice to be served but also where the Constitution so requires. As the Bill stands, the Constitution would have to be amended to provide for this and this is not intended.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:10:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the subsection relating to the serving of notice on members applies where a provision of the Bill requires or authorises a notice to be served but also where the Constitution so requires. As the Bill stands, the Constitution would have to be amended to provide for this and this is not intended.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:10:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to provide a cross-reference to section 181(3) concerning the receipt of notice of general meetings when availing of ordinary post.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:10:00+01:00	This section contains the form of directors compliance statement as recommended by the Company Law Review Group. Having analysed the provisions contained in the 2003 Act, the group determined that such extra duties as set out would do little to increase compliance and merely result in an increase in red tape at considerable cost to Irish businesses. The set-up costs for a business were estimated at €90,000 and the ongoing annual costs at €40,000. A streamlined version of the directors compliance statement proposed by the Company Law Review Group removed the requirement that the statement include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments which could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant since companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas and their inclusion in the directors compliance statement did not add substantive duties. A wide majority of the Company Law Review Group, that is, more than 80% of the members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the directors compliance statement. There is a strong European Union impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. The amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs for Irish businesses without adding value in terms of protection. It would disadvantage Ireland competitively as it would move beyond other countries. The directors compliance statement, as it stands, has broad support. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve the directors compliance statement as it stands within the Bill. On this basis, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:10:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to remove the unintended requirement in the Bill for the disclosure of directors' interests in share options granted by parent companies. When a 1% or less share option is granted, it is not required that it be reported to the company.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:20:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment to this section on Report Stage in order to bring it into line with existing law. I am also considering introducing an amendment to Chapter 15 on Report Stage in order to bring the audit exemption criteria in line with Article 52 of Directive 2013/34/EU. The aim of this directive is to simplify the accounting requirements for small companies and improve the clarity and comparability of companies' financial statements within the Union. The new directive takes the small company or group as the starting point and imposes additional requirements on medium-sized companies and groups and even further requirements on large companies and groups, as well as on public interest entities. Essentially, the latter are listed companies, banks and insurance undertakings, whether listed or not, regardless of size. This is described as a "think small first" approach. Directive 2013/34/EU must be transposed into national law by July 2015.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:20:00+01:00	I have sympathy for the situation of the person to whom the Senator refers but I cannot accept the amendment. What is proposed would not be a logical inclusion in companies' financial statements. Such statements relate to companies' financial performance and not to their tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government were to consider a requirement to oblige businesses to obtain and publish certificates of tax compliance, the appropriate place to do so would be in tax law rather than company law in order that both company and non-company businesses, which also pay taxes, would be contemplated. The introduction of the suggested requirement would be entirely without precedent across the European Union. It is on this basis that I am not in favour of accepting the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	I shall take the two amendments together, if I may. I am unclear as to why the Senator has proposed the deletion of subsections (2) and (6), particularly as the proposal does not include any replacement texts. I can only surmise that he is opposed to the Bill making provision for alternative methods for the storing and managing of accounting records, rather than the requirement to keep accounting records on a continuous and consistent basis. Perhaps he will clarify the matter. The purpose of subsections (2) and (6) is, respectively, to ensure that accounting records must be kept on a continuous and consistent basis, and that they must be available for inspection in the State. This stems from existing law, specifically section 202 of the 1990 Companies Act. It ought to be noted that the requirement to keep proper books is not an obligation to act as a passive custodian of books, but rather a positive and continuing obligation to create books and records in a particular form and with specified content. The provision has to be general in some respects because technology may change and one cannot be over-prescriptive at the same time.  Subsection (2) in the Bill is cognisant of the fact that ledgers exist in electronic form and, therefore, requires that such ledgers must also be updated and safeguarded from falsification, in a positive manner. It is important that the Bill reflects the realities of the majority of modern company practices. I am not in favour of deleting existing law from this section, on that basis.  The Companies Bill anticipates that where such records are kept, other than book form, safeguards shall be taken to guard against falsification. Subsection (6), subject to the provisions of subsection (7), ensures that where accounting records, other information and returns are kept on a computer that the computer shall be kept in the State. This is another positive duty that recognises that many modern companies no longer rely on ledgers and paper when maintaining or recording any transactions. I cannot support a proposal to remove references and safeguards relating to technological innovations from this section. This Bill aims to strike a balance between good regulation and the need to ensure that the operating environment for companies in Ireland is informed by the realities of modern companies. Record management is a crucial aspect for modern companies. The rationale behind these provisions is to ensure that the companies availing of modern technologies shall take certain precautions to ensure that said records are accessible and authentic.  With regard to the second point made about records, we could take a look at that on Report Stage. I also take the point that the Senator made in relation to cloud computing which is something we must have due regard for. Perhaps we could come back to it at a later stage in the proceedings, if that is okay with the Senator.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment to this section on Report Stage. It is considered that further refinement of the wording, regarding the penalty, may be required as it may not be specific enough.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to delete the reference to a "bank" and replace with the word "institution". This will result in a uniformity of language throughout the Bill and is in line with EU law. It is a technical drafting amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	This is a significant amendment and arises as a consequence of the CLRG's recommendation in 2013 that company law be amended to allow companies that meet two of the three criteria relating to balance sheet total turnover and number of employees, to qualify for audit exemption. The intention here is to use the available provisions in EU law to help small companies.The Bill, as it stands, incorporates section 32(3)(a)(ii) and section 32(3)(a)(iii) of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999. It provides that a private company limited by shares that meets three specified criteria may be exempted from the general rule that the annual accounts of a company must be audited. The three criteria and their current thresholds are: the annual turnover does not exceed €8.8 million; the balance sheet does not exceed €4.4 million; and the average number of employees does not exceed 50. The current thresholds were set in August 2012 and are given effect in two statutory instruments: the European Union (Accounts) Regulations 2012, SI No. 304 of 2012; and the Companies (Amendment) No. 2 Act 1999 (Section 32) Order 2012, SI No. 308 of 2012. This legislation transposes into Irish law elements of the fourth Council directive on the annual accounts of certain types of companies, which provides that member states may exempt companies from the obligation to conduct an annual audit where they meet at least two of the three criteria. When introducing this provision into Irish law in 1999, the Oireachtas chose to require companies to meet all three. The Bill, as initiated, carried forward the existing legislative provisions on audit exemption and now proposes to extend the scope of the exemption. In this regard, the Bill also provides for the application of the exemption for the first time to companies limited by guarantee. It provides that a company may be either a parent or subsidiary applying the three criteria to the group as a whole and not to individual companies within the group. This also proposes the application of the audit exemption to a dormant company.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	This amendment is to clarify the District Court's jurisdiction and that the extension of filing period applications in respect of annual returns is limited to returns that are delivered to the CRO on or after the commencement of this section. This would preclude companies that have already filed annual returns from seeking extensions of time and other misuses of the section, such as seeking refunds of late filing penalties. An application to the District Court can be made only by companies with outstanding returns at the time of the Bill's commencement.SECTION 358 Amendment agreed to.Government amendment No. 79:In page 349, line 22, after “that” to insert “2 or more of”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to exclude securitisation-type companies from the audit exemption criteria. Securitisation companies are companies that are either registered financial vehicle corporations within the meaning of Article 1.2 of FVC Regulation (EC) No. 24/2009 of the European Central Bank or financial vehicles engaged solely in activities where economic participation is by way of debt or other corresponding instruments which do not provide ownership rights in the financial vehicle as are provided by the sale of units or shares. Amendment agreed to.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to refine the definition of "charge". It is appropriate to have "shares, bonds or debt instruments" contained in a distinct sub-clause.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to provide that the definition of "charge" could be altered by statutory instrument in the future to ensure continued alignment with a financial collateral arrangement under the European Community’s financial collateral arrangements regulations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to align the Bill with existing legislation. The words "is created in the State" are redundant and do not serve any useful purpose, particularly in light of the fact that subsections 99(3) and 99(5) of the Companies Act 1963 are not repeated here. Sections 410 and 411 agreed to.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:40:00+01:00	The purpose of these amendments is to provide for a modification of the rules governing priority of charges. "Priority of charges" refers to where two or more successive mortgages are created over the same property.The current rule of priority is that the first mortgage has priority over the subsequent mortgage, subject to an exception where the second mortgagee gives notice to the first of the creation of the second mortgage, in which case the second mortgage will have priority over amounts secured by the first mortgage advanced after the date of such notice. This is known as the tacking of further advances. As far as charges on land are concerned, the exemption is contained in section 111 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and section 75 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. However, there is no equivalent legislation which governs assets other than land, rather the same result is arrived at under common law. As the Bill stands, section 412 provides that unless their priority is otherwise governed by another enactment, charges will rank in priority in accordance with their date of registration in the CRO and makes no provision for the tacking of further advances. Accordingly, if the section is enacted in its current form, the position on the tacking of further advances will vary, according to whether the assets charged are land or assets other than land. The holder of a second charge over land will be able to get priority over further advances, whereas the holder of a second charge on other assets will not as there is no legislative provision for it. This would not be a desirable outcome. The purpose of the further amendments is to bring the chapter in line with the recommendation made in the CLRG's second report to exclude a notice of crystalisation of a floating charge, events giving rise to crystalisation or provisions for dealing with payments of proceeds to be made into a special designated account from the particulars of a charge received by the registrar and entering into the register. Subsection (5) sets out provisions filed in form C1 which should not be taken for filing to cut down on the work of the CRO in preparing the form while retaining the requirement to file details of charges. Negative pledges are excluded under section 412, but notice of crystalisation events, a floating charge, events giving rise to crystalisation or provisions dealing with payments or proceeds to be made into a special designated account should also be excluded. This was recommended in the CLRG's second report. The section contains various transitional provisions relating to priorities and ensures priority as between charges created just before commencement but not registered until after and charges created just after commencement will be determined according to the rules of sections 412 and 413, not according to existing law.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:50:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that "special majority" means a majority in number representing at least 75% in value of the creditors, class of creditors or members or class of members, as the case may be, will be present and voting in person or by proxy at the scheme meeting. The section defines a number of terms for the purposes of this Part.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:50:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendments is to remove the obligation to make documents available for physical inspection where documents are available on the website of the company free of charge.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:50:00+01:00	I am considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to cater for the consequences of a merger on real or immovable property. It may be possible to improve the language of these provisions to increase certainty with respect to the property transactions and thus reduce the paperwork and costs to business associated with a merger.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T17:50:00+01:00	The purpose of the amendment is to correct a subsection reference.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T18:00:00+01:00	The amendment merely purports to insert a female pronoun into this section.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T18:00:00+01:00	I am not in a position to adopt these amendments. The Bill is concerned with company law only. In general terms, company law concerns itself with the fiduciary duties that a director owes to the company alone while recognising that a director ought to "have regard to the interests" of his or her employees. It would be wholly inappropriate to include the proposed provisions in the Bill. Legislation governing employee rights should be considered in the context of employment law. By addressing such a matter in a company Bill, the provision is not providing protection for all employees such as sole traders and those working in partnerships. Second, employment law already provides for redress in less cumbersome and costly fora than the High Court. Equally important, it must also be borne in mind that company law must balance the rights of all creditors, many of whom are employers in their own right, in winding up situations. I appreciate that the Senator is attempting to achieve laudable goals here but the simple fact is that company law is not the correct vehicle for these ambitions and it is on that basis that we are not in favour of the amendments.  In addition to the general objections previously noted, amendment No. 104 would fail in substance as prosecutions thereunder would be doomed to fail due to the ambiguity of the phrase "breach of employment law". There is no indication as to what is meant by this. No such provisions are workable but only in the context of a specific and appropriate enactment where the transgressions are clearly identified or identifiable. Finally, the amendment proposes that the separate legal personality of the company would be breached for a transgression of civil law rather than criminal law. In all the other circumstances where this phrase is used, for example, in health and safety legislation, it requires a criminal offence.  Amendment No. 105 suggests that a company may be wound up in court where it owes an employee or a group of employees more than €1,500. The Bill sets a limit at €10,000 as it was considered that greater balance and proportionality must be achieved in circumstances where the sanction of wind up is potentially so severe. The section does not distinguish between an employee and any other creditor. In the circumstances, any creditor is entitled to issue a letter demanding payment and if after 21 days, such payment has not been received, the creditor is entitled to petition the High Court. I am sure the Senators present appreciate that petitioning the High Court is not a simple or low-cost exercise. It would have to be questioned whether winding up was really the most effective way to settle a debt for €1,500. It must also be borne in mind that there are provisions in both employment and health and safety law alongside common law remedies that already provide for the type of situation described. For example, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides more efficient remedies for employees who have not been paid their wages than an attempt to have the company wound up in the High Court with all of the associated costs. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T18:00:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the court's discretionary powers in circumstances where a company fails to comply with a requirement to deliver within 14 days after the commencement of the members' voluntary winding up a copy of the declaration to the registrar.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T18:10:00+01:00	The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the Minister may prescribe the most cost-effective manner in which the Courts Service can maintain unclaimed dividends and balances.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-17T18:10:00+01:00	The amendment is typographical in nature and does not have a substantial impact on the Bill.
