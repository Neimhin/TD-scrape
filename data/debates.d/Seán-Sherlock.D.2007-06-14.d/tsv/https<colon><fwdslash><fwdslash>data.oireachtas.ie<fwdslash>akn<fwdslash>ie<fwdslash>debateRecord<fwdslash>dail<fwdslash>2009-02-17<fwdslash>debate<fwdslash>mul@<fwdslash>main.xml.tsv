[<p eid="para_650">I was raised with the notion that the taxation system should be progressive, based on equity and one's ability to pay.  This is not a pension levy; it is a levy on income.  It is completely and utterly contrary to any canons of taxation and to the republican — I use that in the widest sense of the word — ideals to which we subscribe in this great little liberal democracy of ours.  I wish to reflect the anger of one person in north Cork who wrote to me and whose voice is reflective of thousands of others.  I wish to read into the record an e-mail I received from him.  It states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_651">I am appalled at the proposed levy of 7.5% being imposed on me by the Government.  I am a committed public servant who works hours far in excess of those required by my work contract, for nothing.  In December 2008 alone I worked forty hours overtime for which I neither claimed nor was given payment.  During my twenty-three years of public service I have worked about ten hours a week overtime without pay, on many occasions I have worked far more than that.  Last year my conditions of employment were varied and I was obliged to pay Eighty Euros additional tax per week.  I did so without complaint.  This year in January an employment levy was imposed on me that took an additional Twelve Euros plus per week.  Now in February 2009 I am being told to pay an additional Ninety Euros pension levy for which I will receive no benefit whatsoever!  My deduction prior to the imposition of any of these additional taxes were as follows: PRSI [approximately] 3.25%, Superannuation plus Widows and Orphans 6.5%, Notional service 7.28% totalling 17.03% plus VHI of [approximately] fifty Euros as my PRSI contributions entitle me to nothing while my wife and I are both alive.  I recently put two members of my family through third level college and received no grants whatsoever.  My weekly deductions after this levy is applied will total approximately four hundred and sixty Euro per week.  I have always felt that it was my duty as an Irish citizen to give a contribution above and beyond that called for by my work contract.  I have done so willingly and have even enjoyed doing so.  I paid my taxes and did so without complaint.  I felt that I was doing what every loyal Irishman or Irishwoman should do and that every other working Irishman or Irish woman was doing the same.  Now, however, I feel that I am being singled out as a soft target because of my position as a public servant and that my contribution to Irish society and the country has been demeaned.  I would not object as vehemently if the load were spread out evenly among all contributors.  However, if and when we get back on our feet in this country, I will still be paying this levy, whereas if it were income tax I would be treated in exactly the same way as other taxpayers and when taxes were reduced all round again I would also benefit.  [This] is not to be the case, however, and I will remain a victim of this unjust imposition for the rest of my working life.  You will understand why I feel that my commitment and dedication are not appreciated, why I feel that I am being singled out as a scapegoat for the economic collapse and why I will not feel in the future that I should go that extra mile, as I and many others do every week of every year without acknowledgement or expectation of it.  This is taxation without consultation, a punitive measure directed at a section of Irish society that has contributed to Irish economic growth without receiving a commensurate reward.</p>, <p eid="para_652">The Government must seriously rethink its strategy on what I call this income levy.  We are all willing to share the burden but if we are to spread the burden, it must be done on the basis of equity and fairness.</p>]
