SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T18:40:00+01:00	I am conscious that I am not a member of the committee. I am happy to come in last.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T18:40:00+01:00	I thank the Chair.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:00:00+01:00	I am glad to have the opportunity to attend this meeting. I am trying to get a deeper understanding of the culture and the dynamics that exist between fishing communities and our guests' good selves in the SFPA. What I have seen so far, and I think they would objectively agree, is that a tension exists, and I use the word "tension" advisedly. I need to have a better understanding of the governance arrangements and the statutory functions of the SFPA in respect of its relationship with, in the first instance, the community as represented by fishers and processors, and also in regard to this consultative committee. My understanding is that Mr. Hayes is the executive chairperson. He is the boss, as it were, to use a colloquial expression. Is that the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:00:00+01:00	Mr. Hayes is, de facto, the boss.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:00:00+01:00	It is a serious question and I will explain why that is. In the brief time I have been allocated, I am trying to get some clear understanding of the dynamics that inform the organisation. Is Mr. Hayes the boss or not?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:00:00+01:00	That explains it. Bear with me-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:00:00+01:00	I beg the Acting Chairman's protection. I am going to be very respectful and ask for brevity in the answers. That is all I ask for - I say that with the utmost respect - because I want to cover as much ground as possible. Mr. Hayes is the boss and the de facto CEO. That is what we understand, in business parlance, an executive chairman to be. Very briefly, will Mr. Hayes explain what a notice to weigh on landing is? I will defer to him on this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	Okay. That is fine. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	Mr. Hayes referred to a meeting that took place on 4 February. Was the issue of notices to weigh on landing discussed at that meeting? If it was discussed, was an agreement reached in regard to the terms of the notices to weigh on landing? Was that agreed at that meeting on 4 February? This is a yes-no question. We do not need a long context.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	Is it possible, within reason, to characterise how the industry would have perceived the outcome of that meeting on 4 February? Could the industry have perceived that there was some degree of agreement in regard to the issue of the notices to weigh on landing?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	What was the process by which the notices to weigh on landing were withdrawn? Did Mr. Hayes say this was done on 6 March?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	We all start from the vantage point that Ms Loughnane outlined earlier - we all value the industry and want to see a sustainable industry. That is built into the thinking of all of us who have an interest in the sustainability of the industry, including processors, fishers and those with other vantage points. I am trying to understand the dynamics in respect of the consultative committee. I understand Mr. Hayes attended the meeting on 4 March. Would there have been an opportunity at that meeting to further discuss the issues around the notice to weigh on landing? I do not have a masters degree in fisheries policy, and I am not being facetious when I say that. Many of us are on a steep learning curve. If there is a consultative committee, you would hope the culture of that committee would be such that you would all move together in lockstep and the consultative committee would be the mechanism through which you would work through or triage all of these issues. The perception I have is that the industry feels it is on the back foot now. This is the perception, rightly or wrongly. It feels it is being put upon. As a layman in this respect, I fail to understand why the industry would have ownership of a device that is the subject of a regulatory process. I ask Mr. Hayes to forgive me if it is a stupid question, but I am not afraid to ask a stupid question. Why would it be the industry? If you are regulating the industry, why would the industry own the device or the machine? Mr. Hayes outlined options for us. I am still trying to understand fully the differences between options 1 and 2. I have been doing some searching and made some notes. Is there are a danger on option 1 that you are asking an operator to make a false declaration of their landings? Water will potentially be recorded as fish and not as water. I am operating from the notes I was jotting down and I could be wrong. I ask Mr. Hayes to forgive me if I am way off the mark. On option 2, it seems to me - again, I could be wrong so he can disavow me of my ignorance if necessary - that the operator can drain as much water from the fish he or she chooses but only 2% of the final weight can get recorded as water. Am I understanding that correctly? Does this not run contrary to the whole issue of sustainability and preserving the fish? If only 2% of the final weight can be recorded as water, what permutation does that have for the quality of the fish in situ while the fish are going through this process? We are in Kafkaesque territory if we have reached a point on this lovely island of ours where we are talking about such options. I really want to understand option 2, in particular. I am worried that under option 2, the quality of the fish could become severely diminished. The sustainability question then comes in. The quality question also comes in, as does the value question that we are all concerned about. Mr. Hayes does not have to tell me I am ignorant if it is an ignorant question, but he can educate me. I am happy to be educated.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:10:00+01:00	Does that tick the box for the SFPA in terms of DG-MARE?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Sorry, I meant to refer to the inadvertent making of a false direction. Is that a possibility? I am not saying-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Does that not require placing an onus on the vessel to have ice or storage facilities on board that are fit for purpose so as not to compromise the quality of the fish? Is that not placing an additional burden on the vessel thereafter or does this happen so quickly that there is no such compromising of the quality of the fish?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Is this not all very surreal? Does Mr. Hayes not sometimes ask how we got to the stage in fisheries policy where we are talking about taking fish off a vessel, putting it into another tank, and then taking that tank and putting it back into the vessel again?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	On a human level, is that not a bit surreal?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Please do not patronise me, Sir.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Mr. Hayes does not need to tell me about my role here. Mr. O'Mahony might explain. We are trying to get it effectively explained for the punter who is watching these proceedings.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	I appreciate that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-18T19:20:00+01:00	Yes, it is.
