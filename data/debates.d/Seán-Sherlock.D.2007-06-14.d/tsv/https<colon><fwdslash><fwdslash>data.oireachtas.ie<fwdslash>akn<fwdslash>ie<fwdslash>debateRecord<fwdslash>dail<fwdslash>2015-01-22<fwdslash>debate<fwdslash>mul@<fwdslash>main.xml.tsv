[<p eid="para_90">Ireland is playing a strong role in the international response to the Ebola crisis through the work on the ground of its embassy in Sierra Leone - it is one of very few countries that have such a bilateral relationship with that country in particular - and through its significant financial support. In 2014 alone, the Government provided more than €18 million directly and through non-governmental organisations, NGOs, to the most affected countries in that region. This included approximately €10 million through its annual development programmes in its partner countries, namely, Sierra Leone and Liberia, which have a particular focus on strengthening the national health systems. Moreover, the Government has provided more than €5.6 million specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and for work on contact-tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes. The Government intends to continue this strong focus in 2015.</p>, <p eid="para_91"> While there appears to have been a welcome slow-down in the incidence of cases of Ebola in recent weeks, there are fluctuations from country to country. It is therefore essential that the international community maintains its resolve to defeat the epidemic and not lose the momentum of its response. The World Health Organization, WHO, reports that fatality rates for hospitalised patients in the most affected countries are between 57% and 60%, which still is too high. However, deaths outside treatment centres are significantly under-reported, making it difficult to provide a completely accurate case fatality rate for the outbreak as a whole. Now that Ebola transmission rates are dropping slightly and pressure on beds is reducing, more suspected Ebola cases will go directly to treatment centres rather than transiting through holding centres while awaiting test results. This will allow more patients to receive the highest quality of care at an earlier stage and that will lead to improved outcomes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">Through the Chair, I wholeheartedly agree with everything Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has said. In fairness to the Irish response, it has been extremely influential in influencing the United Nations response. There is a United Nations mission on the ground - I was present in Freetown on the very weekend it arrived - and because of the presence of our ambassador and team on the ground, as well as Irish NGOs being on the ground in Sierra Leone and Liberia, we were able to influence the global response to the crisis. However, for our part and in respect of our response as a nation, it was early and effective. While I agree absolutely with Deputy O'Sullivan when she states there are more fundamental problems, the Government has an embassy and accreditation there by virtue of the fact that Sierra Leone is third from last on the human development index. This signifies Ireland's commitment to those countries on the very issues such as education, maternal health, nutrition, gender and so on. When I visited, I spoke to the President and the Ministers for social welfare, education and health on those very issues because the Government believes strongly that there must be action on them and that Ireland has a role to play in assisting countries such as Sierra Leone in that respect.</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">To their credit, the Irish NGOs are working directly with people and seek to empower people on the very dynamics about which the Deputy has spoken. While I acknowledge the Deputy is not necessarily making this point, Ireland does not take a patronising or patriarchal view in this regard. We help people to empower people to build up capacity in order that they can do it themselves. However, the immediacy of the Ebola crisis has caused the Government to shift the focus towards directing funding towards that crisis <i>per se</i> by directing funding to things like call centres, community mobilisation and psychosocial issues. However, once the Ebola crisis is over, the work to which the Deputy refers will continue apace and the Government's commitment to that region of west Africa is as strong as it ever has been.</p>]
