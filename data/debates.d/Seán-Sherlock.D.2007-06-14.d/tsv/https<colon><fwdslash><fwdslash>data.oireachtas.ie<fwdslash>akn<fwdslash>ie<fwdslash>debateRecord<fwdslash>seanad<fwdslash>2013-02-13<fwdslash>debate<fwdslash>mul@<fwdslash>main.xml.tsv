SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-02-13T14:40:00+00:00	I thank the Senator. I will respond in general to some of the points raised by him.His points are valid and we are conscious of them because we want to ensure we have the best research landscape in the world. That is our ambition and with the meagre resources we have, given we are borrowing €300 million per week, we want to prioritise. I take the Senator's point on the word "strategic" but the sense of the word for the purpose of this legislation is that we have a strategy that is mapped out through the national research prioritisation exercise. The steering group has reported on 14 key areas the State will fund. That is not the end. The State's resources that are applied to this are a portion of the overall spend on research and innovation. We need to have context. The HEA block grant is €1.02 billion and research prioritisation amounts to €440 million. There are other research funders through private enterprise and entities such as the Health Research Board, Teagasc and the IRC. If we send a signal about this legislation to the research community, it must say that in times of economic constraint, we have built up the capacity in recent years and now we want to sharpen the focus. That does not mean that botanists, for instance, cannot be funded within the Irish landscape. It is not true to say that if they are not within research prioritisation, they will not be funded. It is unfair for anyone to make that assumption. There are imaginative ways where if people can prove an economic or social impact, and there are clear metrics set out by SFI in the area, I see no reason that area of research cannot be funded. If a project does not fit into prioritisation, it does not mean the area will be an outlier in the system. Talking of mathematics, which underpins all of the best science, there is no reason that mathematicians cannot map on to the prioritisation exercise. There is a mechanism for them to do that. We are thinking long term and in terms of the next generation. We want to come up with a research infrastructure to ensure that we can attract the sort of world class researchers who are so necessary for the system we have and to measure up to that excellence and have a long-term goal of excellence. This legislation is part of that process and is necessary. There is within the prioritisation exercise a clear pathway to measuring outputs. We are in the midst of completing a metrics paper with the assistance of Forfás, which I thank for its work so far, that will measure outputs and impact. It is important to measure on behalf of the taxpayer where funding is being funnelled and the impact it is having. That process is ongoing and I am conscious of the Senator's point. I also agree with the Senator about the role of industry. Sometimes we get stark messages from industry but we are engaged in a process whereby we are putting together a group of people, some from the HEI and some from industry, in order that we can map out what is happening in the stem cell area. There are two aspects to that. We must ensure we have the continuing professional development that is so vital at primary and secondary level so we have the through-put into the tertiary education sphere. We also must ensure that where disparate initiatives are taking place in industry, if there is a way to map them, we will do so to see how they can be replicated across the system. Every child at primary and post-primary level should have access to that industrial engagement in the area of promoting science, technology, engineering and maths. All of this inhabits the educational sphere. Regarding the legislation, section 3 will insert a definition of "applied research" and define "strategic areas of opportunity for the State which shall be construed in accordance with section 7(6). "Applied research" means original investigation undertaken to acquire new knowledge directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective. Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications. This amendment is necessary to enable Science Foundation Ireland to support applied research, as well as continuing to support oriented basic research. The other amendment to section 3 will help to refocus the foundation's efforts in areas of opportunity by adding the term "strategic areas of opportunity for the State". This revised definition relates to the revision of Science Foundation Ireland's functions provided for in section 4. The amendment relating to strategic areas of opportunity will allow for Science Foundation Ireland to realign its programme portfolio in line with the recommendations arising from the national research prioritisation steering group, which was chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel. The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure. To support these priority areas on the basis of existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities in the global market place and those most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and, ultimately, jobs, the Government approved the recommendations arising from the group's recommendations. The aim is to align the majority of public STI investment with 14 areas of opportunity identified in the report, as well as the underpinning technologies and infrastructure. The report also acknowledged the important role of research for policy and research for knowledge, and recommended the remaining funding be channelled to support these two areas. A number of measures were also recommended to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the STI system. It is in the context that the Bill provides for the refocusing of the research themes to be funded by the SFI towards the priority areas of opportunity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:00:00+00:00	I acknowledge the point made by the Senator in speaking of the importance of education. Without wishing to be pedantic, the purposes of the Bill are reasonably clear. Nevertheless, I note the points the Senator makes on the importance of the teaching role and function in education. This area is also part of current deliberations in the restructuring of higher education and its teacher training component.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:00:00+00:00	Should I speak to the amendment given that the Senator proposes to withdraw it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:00:00+00:00	I do not support the amendments. The main purpose of section 7(1)(e) is to ensure a co-ordinated approach to research among bodies in the State by extending the scope of Science Foundation Ireland's consultation to bodies anywhere. The amendment would dilute this purpose and could increase costs. On amendment No. 13, Science Foundation Ireland's objective is, as set out in the legislation, to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State. It is funded by the State through the Department's Vote. The purpose of the power of the Minister to issue directions to Science Foundation Ireland is to specify particular actions relating to the carrying out by the foundation of its functions in line with these objectives and ensure public funding is used in accordance with these objectives. Allowing external bodies to influence these policy directions would not be appropriate. I note Senator Barrett's reference to consultations with learned societies such as the Royal Irish Academy and Royal Dublin Society. While I do not wish to be facetious, there are a number of learned societies, including many with the designation "Royal". This long list includes the Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland, the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal Geological Society of Ireland, the Zoological Society of Ireland, Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Honorable Society of King's Inns, the Irish Association of Physicists in Medicines, the Irish Recorded Music Association and the Irish Texts Society. While I am aware the Senator is not being prescriptive, the role of determining science policy is predicated on a stakeholder engagement. Last year the Royal Irish Academy hosted a good seminar on prioritisation and its impacts. The Irish Research Council has a strong role in the humanities and social sciences. In shaping any new strategy on science, technology and innovation, I must have a clear vision, following the prioritisation exercise, that proceeding with a new strategy for the country requires a clear role for the higher education institutes and all funders of research in the Irish landscape. We must also pay due regard to the institutions to which the Senator referred. However, for the reasons I have outlined, we should not be prescriptive in terms of how Science Foundation Ireland conducts its business given that the prioritisation is only one proportion of expenditure on research in the country as a whole.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:10:00+00:00	I am not sure I agree with the points made by the Senator. This process on prioritisation and this legislation is not about propagating a system, rather it is about creating a new system. The legislation is designed in the first instance to create more jobs and in the second to create a system of knowledge that can be supported. It is eminently sensible that the Government via the taxpayer would prioritise those areas. There are a number of institutions relating to the research landscape in this country, for example, transport, as mentioned by the Senator. It is not true to say that the transport community was not in some way, shape or form consulted in the research prioritisation exercise. For example, the core issue in respect of priority area K, which relates to smart grids and smart cities, is transport in larger urban conurbations such as Dublin, Cork or Limerick. Work in the research community around these challenges is ongoing. There is no reason the discipline of economics cannot map onto any area of the research landscape. It is for the economists who are housed within the individual higher education institutions to think more laterally about how they can engage with other entities and research clusters in terms of the creation of an impact around that. What we are trying to do is to force the breakdown of silos from an interdepartmental point of view. For instance, we have had some measure of success through the creation of a health innovation hub in Cork. There is ongoing engagement between the Departments of Health and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on how to push further innovation through that demonstrator model. Ireland is a small community and it is now time for people who traditionally operated within their own landscapes or silos to consider how they can collaborate and create new areas of opportunity in terms of how they carry out their research. There is nothing preventing them doing so.  Science Foundation Ireland provides opportunities in its output statement for people across the research landscape. Where good ideas, which potentially have an economic and societal impact become apparent, there will be a mechanism for them. It is for the researchers to start thinking more laterally about how they engage. There is a challenge for researchers within the community.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:10:00+00:00	This section provides Science Foundation Ireland with the power to devise and administer research grant schemes using funds authorised and provided by the Minister with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I consider the proposed amendment as tabled by Senator Barrett unnecessary as all public bodies are required to comply with public financial procedures which are aimed at ensuring the most effective use possible of public funds. There is rigorous examination in the annual Estimates programme of all areas of expenditure and the Oireachtas has significant involvement in this process. I do not propose to accept the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:10:00+00:00	It is clear that research is delivering. More and more of our foreign direct investment wins are predicated on the research and development infrastructure available in this country. The Irish medical devices sector is ranked ninth of ten in the world. The number of social media and ICT related companies located here and the performance of our research and development sector during the past decade has had a significant impact on the economy. As part of the national research prioritisation exercise, which involves all State funders of research coming together, we must now measure that impact, which is vital in terms of ensuring transparency for the taxpayer in the context of the research we chose to fund.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:20:00+00:00	I accept the Senator's point, but it raises the issue of the culture surrounding higher education institutions and asks whether this is a matter for those institutions in terms of their contractual arrangements with employees. I agree that this issue needs to be raised. It is not strictly within the remit of this legislation but I will undertake to discuss it further with the Senator at a future date, given the fact that it has been raised in the House.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:20:00+00:00	In March 2012 the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation transferred responsibility for delivery of the discover science and engineering, DSE, programme from Forfás to Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, on an administrative basis. Since its establishment in 2003, the programme has been actively working with companies and higher education institutions as well as representative bodies, such as Engineers Ireland, to heighten awareness of science and engineering and to raise the level of student uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level. The programme also runs a range of science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, initiatives at primary level. The objective of the DSE programme is to promote awareness and understanding of the importance of STEM, to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics, to promote a positive attitude to careers in STEM and to foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics and their value to Irish society. There are many synergies and mutual complementarities between the programme and SFI, particularly in the light of the outreach programmes run through SFI-funded research centres. The transfer underpinned by this Bill will enable synergies between the programme and SFI funding to be maximised, will increase the programme's impact and will further enhance SFI's science outreach activities. Including subparagraph (iii) of amendment No. 12 would be superfluous, as specifying in legislation the recipients of funding through SFI's awareness programmes is unnecessary. If only certain potential recipients of funding were identified, it would raise questions as to the eligibility of other bodies. We can accept subparagraph (iv) of the amendment in principle. I agree that it would be appropriate for SFI to consult, as appropriate, the Department of Education and Skills where SFI's activities in an area are relevant to that Department. However, I propose to insert the amendment in subparagraph (i), as set out in amendment No. 11. Subaragraph (v) appears to dilute the Bill's objective of enabling SFI to support STEM awareness. It also may go beyond the scope of SFI's function.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:20:00+00:00	I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed by the Senator. It is important to state for the record that the Department has, via a tender won by the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSTL, out of the University of Limerick and NUIG, spent more than €2 million in the past year through a professional diploma, which is being delivered as we speak, for out-of-field maths teachers. There is a clear recognition by the Department of the need to ensure that we have a coterie of teachers who are properly skilled in STEM. I refer briefly to the recent TIMMS and PIRLS results, which mapped out literacy, numeracy and scientific skills among a fourth class coterie at primary school level. Those results clearly show that in the area of literacy we are doing very well and that we are above average in the areas of mathematics and science, but my vision is that we could do much better. My personal vision is that I would like to see the teacher education colleges - which are going through a restructuring process, which is ongoing at higher education level - devise programmes with master's in STEM education or STEM advocates which could be created at primary school level, perhaps at district level. We could engage, for instance, the people who roll out SciFest. I take the point that was made that there is an annual pilgrimage to the RDS and the Young Scientist Exhibition has done marvellous work in raising the people's consciousness about science but there are other players in that field such as SciFest. This is where industry has a role to play in raising awareness and consciousness around the need to ensure we have advocates for science at primary level. We need to start thinking of more long-term objectives as well, instead of the five-year electoral cycles. My vision is that we move into five-year, ten-year and 15-year horizons. If we start to look at primary school now in terms of the way STEM education is taught, we will see the long-term results of that in due course. We are conscious of this but for the purposes of this amendment, technically speaking, this is in the area of education and would be done through the higher education strategy, which is a function of the Department of Education and Skills. It is in that context, although I agree with the sentiments expressed, that I would not be in a position to accept the amendment.  I state for the purposes of the record that SFI's objective is as set out in the legislation, to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State. It is funded by the State through the Department's Vote. The power of the Minister to issue directions is for the purpose of specifying particular actions related to the carrying out by SFI of its function in line with these objectives and to ensure that public funding is used in accordance with these objectives. Allowing external bodies to influence these policy directions would not be appropriate. I agree with the sentiments of the amendment but for the purposes of this legislation and in terms of changing or evolving the remit of SFI, I would not be in a position to accept it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:30:00+00:00	I addressed this point in my last intervention where I spoke about the power of the Minister to issue directions. That is for the purpose of specifying particular actions. The directions relate to general policy. I do not think that we are being in any way draconian in that sense. There is a strong culture in this country of successive Governments, regardless of their political hue, having endeavoured to engage with stakeholders in this area. I point to the evidence of the research prioritisation steering group where we asked Mr. Jim O'Hara to chair that process. We brought in all the State's funders of research and those in industry and academia - a myriad of people involved in this area. We try to arrive at the best policy outcomes through a process of stakeholder engagement. It is important to state the powers of the Minister given the democratic mandate that he or she or the Government has. It is not heavy-handed or draconian to state SFI is funded through the Department's Vote and, in that sense, must be directed ultimately by the will of the people. Therefore, I would not support the acceptance of the amendments. SFI's objective is set out in legislation and it is designed to promote and assist the development and competitiveness of industry, enterprise and employment in the State, and that is a worthy endeavour.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:40:00+00:00	A thorough reading of the research prioritisation steering group document will reveal a clear statement about research for knowledge and for policy. Science Foundation Ireland is not the only game in town. Science Foundation Ireland and the research prioritisation exercise is one of a number of research funders within the State. There are entities like the Health Research Board, the Higher Education Authority, Teagasc, the Irish Research Council and other such bodies. It is important that we have perspective. Research for knowledge is a key component of Government policy and that is embedded in the research prioritisation exercise steering group documentation. It is a fundamental principle and there is no moving away from that. There is also an adherence to the idea that if research does not measure up to excellence, has no impact or is found to be futile and going nowhere, there will be enough people within the system and externally, who will measure its impact and if it is deemed not to be fit for purpose the State can roll back its investment in specific areas. This is not written on tablets of stone. No research community in the world, where the state has an active part to play, is so inflexible that it will continue to research in areas where it is clear that there is no economic or societal impact or where the research does not measure up to the principle of excellence.  I can understand where Senator Barrett is coming from. He speaks about the enhancement of knowledge in the wider society. It is not only taken as a given that we are trying to enhance knowledge. It is set out clearly in the documentation relating to the prioritisation exercise. There is no ambiguity about that whatsoever. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:40:00+00:00	I always accept the Senator's interventions in the spirit in which he makes them. We must be clear, however. Prioritisation is not the entire funding game. There is a myriad of sources. If the principle of excellence is adhered to and impact measured there should be no reason any researcher who is doing excellent research with impact within Irish society could not derive funding from some source. I wonder if some of the researchers who have approached Senator Barrett or are writing letters to The Irish Times or tweeting on this issue have read the steering group document. The document is giving birth to 14 action plans and the 13 systemic changes that are necessary. The document also contains a chapter giving examples of policy research. These examples include climate change, related environmental research, bio-energy, population health research and health services research. Those are mere examples. There is a funding mechanism for everybody, so long as the research measures up to the principles of excellence and impact. The latest €60 million round of investment funding announced by Science Foundation Ireland two weeks ago includes many recipients of funding who are carrying out oriented basic research. There is clear evidence of that across a myriad of landscapes which map on to prioritisation, but more than €2 million was given to MACSI, a pure mathematics entity operating out of the University of Limerick. If we are imaginative, I do not see why we cannot continue to fund such researchers. They need to start thinking more laterally about engaging and collaborating in an interdisciplinary fashion, think about their own output as it stands at present and find new areas of opportunity for themselves. Some of them need to read the documentation before making false assumptions. I say this with respect, having read some of the public discourse on this issue. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-02-13T15:50:00+00:00	The section amends section 9 of the Industrial Development Act 1993 by requiring an institution engaged in research and development funded wholly or partly from moneys provided by the Oireachtas to supply information to Forfás from time to time. This is required by a Commission regulation relating to statistics on science and technology. Forfás compiles data on a yearly basis regarding Government budget appropriations and outlays on research and development, as required under the Commission regulation, and the Bill provides statutory power for Forfás to collect the data necessary for the purposes of complying with the regulation. The Commission regulation has recently been replaced by a new regulation but retains the same requirement regarding the collection of Government budget appropriations and outlays on research and development and other research data. The amendment reflects the new regulation.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-02-13T15:50:00+00:00	I thank the Members for the time afforded to me and for the opportunity to debate the issues. I am grateful for the insights of Senator Barrett on the amendments he tabled and for the contributions of Members on Second Stage.
