[<p eid="para_67">Who was a party to the historical negotiations that brought about a scenario which would see the abolition of quotas in 2015?  Who were the ultimate deciders of that?  Ultimately, was it a decision of the Council of Ministers or of Commissioner Fischer Boel?  If it was a decision of the Council of Ministers, was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a party to that negotiation?</p>, <p eid="para_68">We are being told that the capital investment is in the order of â‚¬286 million at full production.  May I have a breakdown of that figure and how that is disbursed throughout the industry?  Is it disbursed primarily into the co-operative movement or to primary producers?</p>, <p eid="para_69">I am trying to get a sense of where we will be post-2015.  The current scenario does not augur well because global market prices have collapsed and farmers are producing at below cost.  It seems that in a post-2015 scenario with the abolition of quotas one will be left very much to the vagaries of the market.  If the global market at that point is in a poor state, I fear there will be a massive reduction in the production from smaller producers here because they will not enjoy the economies of scale to compete at global market prices.  I am trying to get a sense of where the debate is now, because Commissioner Fischer Boel will not be in that position in 2015 and there may be a new regime here at that stage as well.  The question remaining on every farmer's lips is, will he be able to produce milk competitively and will he derive an income at that time.  I suspect there will be a massive reduction in milk production from smaller producers who will not be able to compete.  There will be a pyramid where there will be a smaller number of larger producers.  I am trying to get a sense of whether that is the ultimate aim or whether that is a policy provision of Commissioner Fischer Boel, the Commission, or the Council of Ministers.</p>, <p eid="para_70">I refer to the issue of commodification of agriculture.  A large part of the morass in which we find ourselves is caused by how milk-derived products have been used as commodities on global markets.  I wonder whether there is a view emerging that, for want of a better expression, decoupling commodities from the production process would stabilise markets and allow farmers to retain a foothold in the market.  I do not have a firm view on it, but I want to know how the commodities market has affected the prices of milk or milk derived products.  It is important to factor that into the process.</p>, <p eid="para_71">I understand a cumulative increase of 9.2% in quota leading up to 2014 is being sold as an assistance to farmers.  If ours is a grass-based system and if there is a view emerging within the Green movement that there should be taxation on carbon, or potentially on methane, I wonder how that will affect grass-based agriculture in future and whether it will mitigate the income effects on farmers in 2014.  I wonder what kind of economic modelling has been put into effect for the post-2015 period because analysis is hard to come by at present.  I fear that large farmers will survive the 2015 scenario but small producers will have to sell-up to a larger producer, and that is something that needs to be analysed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_131">My question about the 9% increase in quotas up to 2014 has not been answered.  If carbon-based taxes are introduced at EU or Irish level, will they be offset against income that may be earned by the increase in methane and grass-based production?  I suggest this theoretical question needs to be addressed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_142">I seek clarification, for my own information, of what Deputy O'Keeffe said.  Is he suggesting milk is being produced competitively in Argentina for 9 cent a litre?</p>]
