[<p eid="para_1769">The recently announced New Frontiers Programme replaces the Enterprise Platform Programme and aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.  New Frontiers is a national programme delivered in 9 regional locations by 13 Institutes of Technology. As participation in the programme is not predicated on the location of the participant's business Enterprise Ireland does not, therefore, collect data on a county by county basis.</p>, <p eid="para_1770">The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6-8 week introductory course. The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres.  Eight Institutes of Technology (IoTs) have partnered to form four collaborative programmes to deliver the New Frontiers Programme while individual programmes are also being offered from a number of IoTs as follows:</p>, <p eid="para_1771">Collaborative Programmes</p>, <p eid="para_1772">Individual Programmes</p>, <p eid="para_1773">IT Carlow/Waterford IT</p>, <p eid="para_1774">Dublin IT</p>, <p eid="para_1775">Limerick IT/IT Tralee</p>, <p eid="para_1776">Dundalk IT (partnered with CIT)</p>, <p eid="para_1777">IT Tallaght/IT Blanchardstown</p>, <p eid="para_1778">Cork IT (partnered with DkIT)</p>, <p eid="para_1779">IT Sligo/Letterkenny IT</p>, <p eid="para_1780">Galway-Mayo IT (partnered with AIT)</p>, <p eid="para_1781">Athlone IT (partnered with GMIT)</p>]
