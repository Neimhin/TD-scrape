[<p eid="para_170">I, too, join in thanking Mr. Reid and his colleagues throughout the HSE for the work that has been undertaken during this pandemic, for which there has been no playbook and no precedent. It was something that had to be managed in an emergency context and the level of care people received has, by and large, been excellent. I acknowledge that Mr. Reid has always made himself available to members of the Oireachtas on issues that have arisen throughout the pandemic. When certain matters arose within my constituency, they were responded to so I have to acknowledge that.</p>, <p eid="para_171"> I will focus on non-compliance in procurement. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that the HSE is developing systems and is making significant improvements in that regard. That is to be acknowledged. I will focus on the more than €40 million that has been spent by the HSE to date across a range of services provided by Ernst &amp; Young, PwC, Grant Thornton, Deloitte and KPMG, both pandemic related and non-pandemic related.</p>, <p eid="para_172">Does €40 million represent value for money for the taxpayer? </p>]
[<p eid="para_174">We know that Ernst &amp; Young has provided services to the tune of €12 million and that PwC has provided services for €5.1 million. A total of €17.5 million has been spent across the five companies up to March 2021. We know it is governed by a framework agreement. What we do not know, and this is what I am trying to get at, is how those individual contracts are managed within the work stream. We know that individual companies provide different types of services, as per the procurement rules. However, in terms of the scope of work, what is perplexing me is how Grant Thornton can receive €4.2 million for the year up to March 2021, Deloitte can receive €4.2 million and KPMG can receive €3.1 million. These are astronomical figures. What I do not have sight of and the taxpayer-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_176">How many minutes do I have left?</p>]
[<p eid="para_178">What the taxpayer does not have sight of are the line-by-line accounting procedures in respect of how those hours are billed for. Please do not throw commercial sensitivity at me on this one because all of the consultancy houses have benefited remarkably from the provision of these services under presumably clear procurement rules. What we do not have sight of is how many people were seconded or deployed and how that is being managed internally by the HSE in terms of due diligence and managing the contracts and costs. There is no document anywhere I have sight of that shows me, or by extension, the taxpayer, the dynamics that informed those individual contracts in the public interest and in terms of protecting the "public purse", to quote Mr. Mulvany. This is an issue to which we need to return. We need more transparency.</p>]
