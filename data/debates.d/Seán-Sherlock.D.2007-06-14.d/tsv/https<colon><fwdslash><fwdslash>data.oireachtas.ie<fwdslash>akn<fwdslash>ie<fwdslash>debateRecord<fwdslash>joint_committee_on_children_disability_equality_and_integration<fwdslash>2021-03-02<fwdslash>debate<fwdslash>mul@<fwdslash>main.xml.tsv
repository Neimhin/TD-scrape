[<p eid="para_75">I am in the 1932 annexe to Leinster House, the little-known annexe at the back of the building. I thank the witnesses for coming before us. I will put my questions to the witnesses in a rapid-fire way. The questions are short, and I hope to get short answers as I only have seven minutes.</p>, <p eid="para_76"> Has there been a discussion internally on the ethical basis on which the SOP has been devised and has anybody within the HSE or academia raised issues about it? My first question is for Dr. Morgan.</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">So how would the witnesses characterise the statement that this new SOP is merely a defensive process for legal reasons? Perhaps Dr. Morgan might want to take that question. The implication is that the system was devised using approximately €7.8 million purely for legal reasons to offset the risk of legal action against the HSE downstream.</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">I accept the answer. Regarding community child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the setting up of interdisciplinary teams, I tabled Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 2 December 2020 asking the Minister for Health for the reasons for the delay in all interventions for children under the age of 18 years of age. The subsequent HSE response to me of 17 December was that in respect of community CAMHS services, the waiting times for young people to be seen by the child and adolescent mental health services continue to be an issue in a number of CHOs. It stated that a renewed focus on improving capacity and throughput was in place in this area and some improvement was being shown. I cannot say that is the case in CHO 4.</p>, <p eid="para_83"> Dr. Morgan spoke about silos previously. In the very short time available, if we are talking about knocking down silos, then CAMHS needs to be put under the microscope. He can correct me if I am wrong, but my perception is that CAMHS operates as a silo and until that silo is smashed and there is a greater interdisciplinarity about the way in which teams operate at a community level then we are not going to see the throughput in respect of the therapeutic effects based on the assessments of need. Is that a fair characterisation of CAMHS now in terms of the challenges faced?</p>]
[<p eid="para_85">How am I on time, Chairman?</p>]
[<p eid="para_87">Parliamentary questions are the limited power Deputies have in respect of getting answers. To be fair to the HSE, I always receive comprehensive replies to my questions. I submitted a parliamentary question in September 2020, which sought the numbers on the initial assessment nationally. The figure that came back was 13,273. I tabled the same question in December and the same cohort had risen to 16,466. That is a 24% increase on the numbers nationally waiting for initial assessment. The HSE has mapped in €7.8 million but in real terms, the waiting lists are increasing. That is fact; it is based on the HSE's own figures. In CHO 4, covering Kerry and Cork, the number of children awaiting initial assessment rose from 930 in September to 1,436 in December. I tabled two questions, one in September and one in December. The numbers in CHO 4 indicate 242 additional people are awaiting assessment. Nationally, the number waiting for an initial intervention has increased by 7%. Even if Dr. Morgan is talking about changes to community teams – we take what he is saying in good faith – in real time, the real figures show there is still an exponential increase in the waiting lists. Notwithstanding the amount of money that has been mapped onto this and the entirety of the budget, the figures show me that it is still difficult to keep pace with demand. That is something that must be addressed.</p>, <p eid="para_88"> I am sure I am out of time but I will make a final point and Dr. Morgan can come back to me later. I wish to raise the issue of deaf schools, in particular the fact that site-specialised speech and language therapy services are being taken away from deaf schools at present. That is wrong and it needs to be revised. They are people who always had a service within those schools and it seems now that it is being excised out of the system by the centralisation of services under the progressing disability services strategy. I ask that the decision would please be revised, in particular as it relates to deaf schools throughout the country.</p>]
[<p eid="para_139">I welcome this process and see it as being part of an ongoing process of communication with the HSE and Dr. Morgan and the team so I welcome most of the responses. It gives rise to further questions but we will interrogate them in due course. The €7.8 million is still hanging out there for me. I received a reply to a parliamentary question dated 22 December from Dr. Morgan in respect of the breakdown of the €7.8 million. I use CHO 4 because it is the area with which I am most familiar but it is representative of many CHOs. He stated that assessments of need completed went from 29 in September 2020 to 69 in October and 257 in November. This is a massive jump. What I wanted to find out was the breakdown of the costs. How was that €7.8 million distributed? I did not get a sufficient answer to that answer. I ask him to revisit Question No. 422 of 10 December 2020, and come back to me again.</p>]
