SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	With regard to the indigenous base, there are many centres of excellence within the higher education institutes.  UCC, for example, is doing considerable work through Food for Health Ireland, an initiative that involves collaboration between the dairy industry and Teagasc in Moorepark in Fermoy, for instance.  The objective is to build on extracting value from milk.  Much research is being done in this regard.  There is collaboration between Teagasc, UCC, UCD and UL to determine how to build functional foods and add nutritional value to foods.  This work is taking place in the indigenous base.  NUIG has the Competence Centre for Biorefining and Bioenergy, which is researching second-generation bio-fuels.The key components are the Programme for Research in Third-Level Institutions, PRTLI, and Science Foundation Ireland, which provides funding.  There is very strong engagement between these bodies and industry.  In real economic terms, investment in research allows this country to compete with other centres of excellence, including global ones such as Singapore, and become a world leader.  It is not often publicised that research and collaboration between industry and the institutes allow us to support exports from our economy valued at approximately €73 billion.Since 2005, foreign direct investment in research, development and innovation increased from approximately 10% to approximately 50%.  There is a highly evolved realisation globally that the companies operating in Ireland through collaboration realise they are able to mine much more value out of the arrangement, and that this is adding to our export base.  However, we must continue to invest because, if investment slips, we could signal to the rest of the world that Ireland is taking its foot off the pedal in terms of investment in very high-level research.  There is a logical component that ensures we can support between 72,000 and 78,000 jobs.  We need to continue on that trajectory.  In other words, a large component of FDI is predicated on ensuring that basic and applied research is there and that we have the requisite competent centres.  We have 28 competent centres of excellence in various scientific fields.  We have the Irish Centre for Manufacturing Research and the Tyndall Centre in UCC, which is a competent centre for micro-electronics.  In addition, there is a competence centre at NUI Maynooth for IT and innovation, which is well supported by companies such as Intel Labs.  There is a strong collaboration in evidence there and, in that sense, we are continuing to push out the boundaries.I profess to having been ignorant of this field when I was in opposition.  Now that I am in government, once one delves into this, one realises that it is undersold as a concept.  The deep collaboration between research and industry is a good news story because of the number of jobs it supports and the exports it generates.  We would not generate so many exports, with a net value of €73 billion, if we did not have these competence centres and the world-class researchers we are able to attract to this country.  I hope that answers the question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I want to address one aspect of Senator Kathryn Reilly's question on commercialisation.  Each institute or university competence centre has a technology transfer office which seeks to facilitate commercialisation of research.  Coupled with that, the State is seeking to prioritise those areas of research for which we can create the necessary jobs, thus focusing on the required research areas.  That prioritisation exercise is currently ongoing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Enterprise Ireland has a presence in all the BRIC countries and the technological component of that would be as integral as any another sector within the economy.Very often, intellectual property, which is valuable and might form part of a larger innovation, is created and the key for us is how to commercialise that research and add value to those who created it.  Sometimes that gives rise to the creation of a spin out company.  A total of 31 such companies were created through the higher education institutes in 2010 but some of the IP created adds value to the Intels or HPs of the world, which have a presence in the country and which are collaborating with the researchers through their involvement in the higher education institutes.  It is a multifaceted approach.  Our challenges are to get more spin outs from Irish universities and institutes of technology and to create the right framework to ensure any research or intellectual property created will add value to Ireland Incorporated.  Technology transfer offices have a key role in this.  Most importantly, the very fact that these blue-chip companies interface with Irish universities and institutes of technology through research collaboration to create intellectual property ensures we can continue to retain that investment in the country.  We can also grow it because these companies return to their parent companies with the good news story of the research component, as the intellectual property adds value to the parent company's stock or portfolio.  We will maintain this route and trajectory but we must also meet the challenge of trying to get more indigenous spin-outs.  The research prioritisation exercise and the work of Jim O'Hara on the innovation task force is part of this and it continues apace.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am not sure one can one put a stricture that intellectual property remain in the country where it has been created by a researcher in a centre of excellence in collaboration with an international company operating in Ireland.  The market is involved in this in terms of how intellectual property is sold.  We try to retain it here in a way that ensures spin-out companies can be created but it does not always happen this way.  The only way a small open economy dependent on foreign direct investment can ensure that investment is to sell technology, innovation or intellectual property because it realises a commercial value for the company in Ireland and retains jobs in Ireland.  I hope this explains it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Regarding Deputy Lyons's point, having a presence in the Department of Education and Skills allows one an overview.  Consider the teaching of mathematics, in which leaving certificate pupils who are well capable of doing higher level maths are instead choosing to do lower level.  It is a calculated decision on points and the allocation of time and resources.  We must move away from that scenario and Project Maths is moving in the right direction.  The Government is seeking to give political impetus to greater involvement by industry stakeholders in shaping policy so that people might be encouraged towards industry and provided with the necessary preparation and skills.  This will take time and I would like this committee or a sub-committee thereof to have a central role in that regard.  If we have experts within, we should find them a role to try to work out the nuts and bolts.From a basic pedagogical point of view, the idea of a steady pipeline and a more rounded graduate means more applied learning and problem solving as opposed to by rote learning.  The latter seems to have evolved to such a point that young people who are going into universities or institutes of technology still structure their learning in this way.  The applied learning skill set needs to be buttressed so that, when companies employ graduates, this will be one way to ensure applied learning has been well built in psychologically.
