[<p eid="para_139">I welcome the motion, which the Labour Party will support. I thank the Minister of State for making specific reference to Cork earlier. There has been much rhetoric in Cork and many harsh words from both sides in respect of this issue. People have become very entrenched and it has gone to law. That is people's right if they want to do that. I ask that calmness be restored on the issue in Cork. I believe that people everywhere acknowledge that the works have to be done but there is a contrast in how they should be done, whether we go for demountable walls and a mix of other types of solutions or for the tidal barrier. It would be very useful to have the perspective of the OPW on the potential cost of a tidal barrier. We have heard a range of figures but I am not aware that active consideration has been given to that or whether a price has been put on that.</p>, <p eid="para_140"> Business people and residents in Cork affected by flooding want a solution. I acknowledge that the Minister of State said he would not meet with the Save Cork City people. I am not asking the Minister of State to do that, but some mechanism needs to be found to bring all sides together. This is something my party colleagues, such as Councillors John Maher and Peter Horgan, have called for. They are on public record on that. We just need a bit of calm. The rhetoric needs to be toned down. Public officials who make public utterances on this issue need to be mindful of the fact that they serve all the people of Cork and all their views. There is a legitimate question mark over whether the consultation process was actively engaged in after the fact or whether there was a proper and due analysis of that consultation process. I am not saying there was not, but there is a question mark in the minds of people in Cork on whether there was an active engagement on that. I ask the Minister of State to have due consideration to that issue also. He is in a powerful position because he has management of the purse strings.</p>, <p eid="para_141">That gives him weight and heft in the debate regarding Cork city. I ask him to use his good offices to seek some sort of intervention, for an honest broker to come into proceedings to mediate a solution between the two sides before the debate becomes even more entrenched.</p>, <p eid="para_142"> The Minister of State also spoke about insurance costs. I met with his predecessor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Canney, a number of years ago about this issue. At this point there is a strong evidence base for the effectiveness of demountable flood defences in towns like Mallow, which is my home town. I live a stone's throw from the Blackwater. I have witnessed the efficacy of demountable flooding structures as they pertain to the Munster Blackwater, particularly for the towns of Mallow and Fermoy. They work and there is an evidence base for that. We have to take on the insurance companies that are not insuring residents and businesses in this area. They are not applying the principle of fairness. Where there is an evidence base and it is incontrovertible that the demountable walls work, there should be no issue in procuring insurance for one's premises. I appreciate the Minister of State's statement that he is looking at this issue but it has been going on for too long now and we are always being fobbed off by the insurance sector. Even though there is a strong evidence base before them, they continue to refuse to insure properties in areas where there are demountable flood defences. I ask the Minister of State to redouble his efforts in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_143"> A minor works scheme application was made in 2018 regarding flooding issues at Castlemartyr, County Cork. We are now on the cusp of 2021. I ask the Minister of State to take a look at the Castlemartyr issue again and to correspond with me on it if possible. The Minister of State spoke about the efficacy of minor flood works schemes last night. Where there are outstanding applications for such schemes, I ask that he consider giving them a degree of urgency.</p>, <p eid="para_144"> I posed a parliamentary question to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about the coastal protection scheme and Roches Point in Cork. I acknowledge that the Green Party councillor Liam Quaide raised this issue previously and Paschal Sheehy of RTÉ did a very good piece on it on 25 October. There is a terrace of 11 coastguard cottages in Roches Point, dating back to the 1830s, where flooding is still taking place. I understand that no application for works has come before Cork County Council. That is something on which I as a local public representative will follow up. If that application comes in from Cork County Council, I ask that the Minister of State gives due consideration to protecting Roches Point. It is a wonderful place. Its people are resilient and it is a key point within our county. It would be great if this matter were given some priority and progressed by the county council.</p>, <p eid="para_145"> In respect of Glashaboy and Blackpool in Cork, some concerns have been expressed about whether the length of the proposed culverts would have an environmental impact on flora, fauna and biodiversity in that area. On foot of me raising the issue here, could I correspond further with the Minister of State about it or could his officials correspond with people in Blackpool who have concerns about whether culverts are the most effective way of dealing with that issue? We will adhere to expert advice but these concerns nonetheless need to be addressed. Glashaboy and Glanmire have had some degree of forbearance and I ask the Minister of State to progress that issue as well because it is vitally important for the residents of the area.</p>]
[<p eid="para_318">My question relates to the proposed amendment to the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 to introduce provisions to regulate the affordability clauses in hire purchase and personal contract plan, PCP, financing arrangements, particularly as they relate to the motor industry. More than 76,000 people are on PCP contracts and the value of loans outstanding is some €1.5 billion. The Tutty report in 2018 advised that legislation be introduced in this area. Many people who have such contracts have lost their jobs as a result of the Covid crisis and are having to seek help from the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, because they are unable to get any forbearance from some of these companies. Will the Taoiseach give this issue his personal attention?</p>]
