[<p eid="para_54">I welcome the delegation and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Calleary.</p>, <p eid="para_55">I will deal with the budget of the Health and Safety Authority for 2009 to 2010.  The Health and Safety Authority addressed the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs on 13 October 2009.  In the course of that meeting Mr. O'Halloran outlined the budget figures.    This year the budget of the Health and Safety Authority is €22.6 million, which is €1.8 million less than at the start of 2008.  Based on current employment levels, this equates to approximately €10.80 per worker per year.  That is the level of cost to the State of providing the Health and Safety Authority.  Some €13.5 million is allocated to payroll, €2.2 million to accommodation, €1.2 million to information provision to industry, employers and employees, and €1 million to travel and subsistence.</p>, <p eid="para_56">Has there been a further reduction in the HSA's budget for 2010?  What is the breakdown for all of these areas?  As a result of the major downturn in the construction industry has there been a reallocation of resources and funding to other areas such as farm safety?  I wish to put these questions first of all and, begging the Chairman's indulgence, I will put some more questions afterwards.  However, I would prefer to get the answers to those first, if possible.</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">I beg the Chairman's indulgence on this.  I wish to drill down into the figures somewhat <i>vis-à-vis</i> the HSA.  We all buy into the strategy of the farm safety action plan 2009-2012.  We all realise that all the stakeholders are involved.  However, we are unable to see a significant dent in the figures over an historical period.  Perhaps I am incorrect in this regard.  Let us consider the figures for the HSA in 2008.  There was expenditure of €1.2 million for information provision, €1 million for travel and subsistence, and €2.2 million for accommodation.  The question arises whether some of these resources should now be reallocated into Teagasc or the farm organisations through some newly-designed programme to ensure there is greater stakeholder involvement by the farm organisations with regard to reducing the number of fatalities and accidents.  I am not convinced that there is a sufficient allocation of resources by the HSA.  The HSA claims it will increase inspections from 1,700 to 3,000 next year but there are only five inspectors.  I surmise those five inspectors have always been there.  Has there been an increase in the number of inspectors attributed to this function?  It is a fairly significant leap to get from 1,700 to 3,000.  It is no harm for us to question these figures within the committee if the major aim of everyone is to try to get the number of accidents down.  I seek a response to these points.</p>]
[<p eid="para_62">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">Chairman, I asked other questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_101">I asked about the budget and the possible diversification of the budget.  I asked about the breakdown of the HSA budget which is €22.6 million.  We were paying €2.2 million for accommodation, €1.2 million for information provision and €1 million in travel and subsistence.  What is the status of the budget now, given that there has been a remarkable reduction in the construction industry?  Is the HSA standing over a figure of €1 million for travel and subsistence?  The number of farm deaths does not appear to have been reduced dramatically.  Out of a total of 40 fatalities across all sectors, the figure for farming is 23.  Where is the bang for the buck in that?  With all due respect, I do not want blasé answers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_105">I appreciate that response and I think the more frank response helps me as a member of the committee.  I had asked also about the statistical range.  Is the number of farm fatalities above the European average?  I asked also whether we should be diverting some of the budget into Teagasc which has a direct involvement and interaction with farmers on the ground.  Should that issue be explored?</p>]
[<p eid="para_124">Is the reduction in the number of advisers not a function of Government policy?  Is the Deputy not a member of the Government party?</p>]
[<p eid="para_136">I join in thanking the contributors.  I assume there has not been an updated study from UCG on recent accident trends and farmer health statistics.  Looking at the figures, it would stand to reason that a higher professional such as a lawyer is infinitely less likely to have an accident than a farmer or an unskilled manual labourer.  Is there anything in the figures that throws light on the subject?  The presentation contains references to the percentage of recent accident trends.  For 2008 to date it refers to a value of 50 for vehicles and machinery and between 2001 and 2007 the figure is 43.  How do delegates interpret these figures?</p>]
