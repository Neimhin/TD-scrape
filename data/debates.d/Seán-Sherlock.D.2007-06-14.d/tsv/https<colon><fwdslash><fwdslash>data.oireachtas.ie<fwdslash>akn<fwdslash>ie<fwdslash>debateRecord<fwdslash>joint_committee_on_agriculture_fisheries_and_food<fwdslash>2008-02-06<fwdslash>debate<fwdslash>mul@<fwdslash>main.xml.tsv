SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I must apologise in advance because I have to speak in the House and will have to leave immediately after asking my questions.I thank the delegation for its presentation.  Mr. O'Rourke hit the nail on the head when he stated our great little country now has a system where every aspect of human behaviour or economic or social practice is being regulated in some way or fashion.  However, the resources to enforce regulation are not available.  Veterinary Ireland and the Veterinary Council of Ireland were willing partners in the Act and acted in partnership during its formulation.  However, we now have a situation where there is penalisation in terms of how the regulation and the Act is enforced.If rural Ireland and our agribusiness are to thrive, this must be predicated on a fully financed veterinary practice, no matter how big or small it may be.  I support wholeheartedly the calls being made today.  The situation is that the regulations are drafted on the eastern seaboard but they have vast implications for those living in the rest of the country.  Sometimes the people drafting the regulations do not realise fully the extent of the problems or the financial hardship they will impose on those operating businesses in rural areas.  Therefore, I fully support the calls being made.I am not sure whether the representatives can answer my one question.  It is possibly a matter for the Minister to answer it and perhaps we should put it to her.  If financial assistance is given by way of grant aid to individual vets, could that be deemed a state aid?  I hope not and that we would be in a position to provide that financial assistance.  If we are going to legislate to modify behaviour and practices, we should at least be able to legislate to provide the assistance and support to back up that legislation.
