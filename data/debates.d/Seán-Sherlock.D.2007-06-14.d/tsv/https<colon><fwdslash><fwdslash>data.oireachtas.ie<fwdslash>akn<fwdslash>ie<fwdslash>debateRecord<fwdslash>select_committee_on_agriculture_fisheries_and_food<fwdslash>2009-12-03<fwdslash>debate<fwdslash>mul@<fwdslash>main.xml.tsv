[<p eid="para_42">If the Minister had a white beard I would probably call him Santa Claus because of the timing of this Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps I am a little cynical about the timing.  If there were savings already in the Department's Vote when were those savings identified and could these moneys have been discharged earlier?  The experience on the ground is such that farmers were put to the pin of their collar and if this funding was available sooner and could have been discharged sooner, it would have alleviated much of the hardship.  I am cynical about the fact that the payments are being processed on 3 December.  The manner in which the Estimate is presented to us is confusing.  I have some degree of intelligence but we are being bamboozled with a set of figures which are difficult to wade through and analyse exactly what is at play.  In his press release the Minister said:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_43">This is not additional Exchequer money, but discharges liabilities earlier than previously planned and is possible because of savings arising on the Department's Vote and the use of EU receipts and will improve the cashflow situation of farmers due to REPS payments and FWMS grants early next year.</p>, <p eid="para_44">When was this identified?  Was it only identified in the last few days?  If it had been identified earlier I would like to know exactly when because it could have alleviated much hardship.  I will not repeat the questions posed by Deputy Creed?  However, I do have a specific question in regard to the humanitarian aid scheme.  I am concerned as to how it will filter down to farmers who are experiencing hardship.  I looked at the criteria for the scheme and I find they are suitably vague.  Has any liaising taken place between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  Will a set of strict criteria be outlined for individual farmers in order that there is no confusion as to their entitlements.  If a farmer in dire financial straits is eligible under the terms of the scheme and presents to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, I am concerned that no bureaucratic barrier would be put in place.  I want to ensure the scheme is simplified in such a way that people can avail of it.  The Minister has said the amount available is €10 million and I understand there is an additional €2 million.  I would like to know a little more about how the Minister proposes to administer the scheme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_92">I apologise for cutting across the Minister.  The humanitarian aid scheme is important.  I know it is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  A person who would normally present to a community welfare officer would be someone who would not have means.  If farmers have to present, they would be deemed ordinarily to have means and therefore the criteria by which they will be judged by the CWO will be much different than, for example, a normal person who would apply.  That is why there must be some liaison between the Departments to ensure that where farmers present to a community welfare officer there are clear guidelines which do not make it a stringent affair or that the rules are not overly bureaucratic for the person who appears.  That is really my point.</p>]
