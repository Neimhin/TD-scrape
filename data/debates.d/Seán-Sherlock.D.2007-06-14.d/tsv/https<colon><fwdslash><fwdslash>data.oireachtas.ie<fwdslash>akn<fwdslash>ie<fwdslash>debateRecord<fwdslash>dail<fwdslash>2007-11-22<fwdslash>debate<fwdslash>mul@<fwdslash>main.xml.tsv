SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It was reported yesterday that the Government is to spend €40 million next year on carbon credits.  Until such time as the year on year spending on credits is reduced, I will take anything said on the Government benches about this issue with a pinch of salt.As a newly elected Deputy, I find this an extraordinary week.  On two of the most important issues pertaining to Ireland, young people and climate change, we have been offered opportunities to speak at length but no legislation or other concrete proposals have been brought forward.  I thought I was elected to address these and other issues through legislation but I see this week that is not the case.  Considering these issues as only worthy of a talking shop adds to the cynicism for politics outside these Houses.I wish to speak specifically about the correlation between climate change and energy production and the demand for food.  There is a danger that the technological advances in agriculture that have dramatically increased crop yields in the past 50 years could be eroded due to the real and present danger of climate change.  Given that solar radiation, temperature and precipitation are the main drivers of crop growth, agriculture is still highly dependent on the climate.  Energy production is also a function of crop growth.  It is therefore obvious that any significant change in climate on a global scale will impact on local agriculture and thereby affect the world's food and energy supplies.It is important for this house to discuss the correlation between climate change and energy security in the context of food production.  According to an article in The Guardian newspaper, record world prices for most staple foods have led to 18% food price inflation in China, 13% in Indonesia and Pakistan and 10% or more in Latin America, Russia and India.  Wheat has doubled in price, the cost of maize is nearly 50% higher than a year ago and rice is 20% more expensive.  Next week, the FAO is expected to state that global food reserves are at their lowest in 25 years and that prices will remain high for years.  The article in The Guardian also stated:Boycotts have become commonplace.  Argentinians shunned tomatoes during the recent presidential election campaign when they became more expensive than meat.  Italians organised a one-day boycott of pasta in protest at rising prices.  German left-wing politicians have called for an increase in welfare benefits so that people can cope with price rises.There is a simple explanation for why this is happening now.  Increases in food prices stem from an increase in oil prices.  Record oil prices are forcing a flight out of food production in favour of energy production.  US farmers are leaving cereals to grow biofuel crops.  Coupled with this change, extreme weather conditions and growing demand from countries such as India and China are causing a serious spike in grain and rice demand.  It is estimated that the competition for grain between the world's 800 million motorists and its 2 billion poorest people, who are simply trying to survive, is emerging as the epic battle of our times.The Government cannot produce a motion on climate change and energy production without factoring in food production and its effect on energy security.  Climate change has already begun to have serious effects on food supply.  Therefore, policymakers in this country will need to adjust their thinking.  We can achieve self-sufficiency in the area of grain production but this must be done in a way that meets security of energy and food supply.  If the United States is seeking to reduce petrol demand by 20% before 2017, we must wake up and take note in this country.We now have a scenario where oil price increases create a demand for food for energy production.  Climate change and inclement weather patterns are forcing a spike in food prices and biofuels from grain production are experiencing unprecedented demand.  This has serious permutations for third world farmers.  Oxfam has already warned that the EU policy of substituting 10% of all car fuel with biofuels threatens to displace poor farmers in Third World countries.  Changes in climate are causing a catastrophe which is forcing the price of food upwards.  One optimistic economic analysis predicts that markets will automatically readjust to food shortages as higher grain prices make it profitable once more to grow crops for people rather than cars.If we are to be serious about this issue in Ireland, we must harness existing resources such as wind and tidal power and subscribe to a philosophy of ensuring food security.  We must encourage greater food production domestically to offset growing demand.  A growing body of opinion asserts that we can become self-sufficient in grain production.  We must examine the possibilities for both food and energy production in the future.  We must become part of the scientific analysis that seeks new crop varieties that can adapt to changing climactic conditions.  We have to encourage a slowdown in population growth globally.  However, I do not subscribe to the Malthusian analysis that population growth will outstrip agricultural growth because regulation and rational human behaviour can keep this scenario from arising.We have to wake up to the fact that if the price of oil rises further it will make fertilisers and transport more expensive, while also making biofuel crop cultivation more profitable.  In the past year alone, the cost of food in this country has risen by 4.4%.  The era of cheap food is over.  The price of milk and flour has increased by 16 and 17% respectively.  If we are to get the equation right, we must strike a balance between ensuring energy supply while also ensuring food supply.  The flight to biofuels must not come at the expense of food production.  While I do not expect much from this Government, future Governments will have to regulate human behaviour and the demand for energy will have to be curbed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I was motivated to table my question on the basis of the growing concern that food price inflation is increasing.  Christmas is approaching and expenditure on food is quite extensive.  There have been increases in the range of 16% to 17% in respect of staples such as milk and, in particular, flour.  There is major potential for growth in the cereal sector to meet this demand.  I accept there are global permutations that will affect how matters pan out for the industry here.  Grain farmers want to see an increase in production to meet domestic demand.  This is particularly the case if one considers the rise in bio-fuel production.My question inquired about the practical solutions the Government will be putting in place to facilitate the increasing trend towards the cultivation of grains.  I have not received an answer in that regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Did the Minister of State refer to a figure of €10 million?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State also referred to figures of 1.355% and 1.53% in respect of output.  These represent minuscule rates of increase and the rate of inflation in respect of food will far outstrip them.  I suggest that those rates should be increased considerably to meet demand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the CAP health check, on the Order of Business yesterday I asked for a debate on these issues on the basis that they will be subject to the co-decision procedure.  While it is a legislative proposal and does not specifically relate to the House, it has major potential implications, both positive and negative, for our agriculture sector and the rural economy.  Will the Minister consider arranging a full debate on this issue, notwithstanding that it will also be addressed in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  The importance of this issue warrants a debate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have already raised the issue with my party Whip who indicated such a debate would be unlikely.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I note the Minister of State was in Germany last month, Mullingar last week and Wexford this week and will, I understand, travel to Rome next week.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	He is increasing his carbon footprint.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Perhaps the Minister will take a boat to Rome.  I thank him for his response.  With 29% of respondents in a survey indicating a willingness to purchase local food, it is clear that farmers' markets have scope to tap this market.  However, given that most people will shop at one of the multiples, it is necessary to target these food retailers.  While the work being done by Bord Bia is without equal, one of the issues to arise from the conference held last week was the need to build a relationship between Bord Bia and the larger multiples.  I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of this when formulating Government policy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am not satisfied with that answer because this was a demand-led scheme and was open to all comers.  If somebody gets an application in on time it is as valid as any other application.  I do not see why the Minister can discriminate against those people who applied within those timeframes but, because the budget line is suddenly cut, are not to be considered.  I ask the Minister to review the decision on the basis that if we encounter serious changes in agriculture into the future then it will be a matter for farmers to improve their holdings and their facilities.  This is a wonderful scheme in terms of what it seeks to achieve but there should be more flexibility on the part of the Government to allow at least those people who got in before the cut-off to be considered.  The word "review" is a very broad term.  It is not a concrete term and it gives no solace to those farmers who applied on time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In the context of the EU CAP health check, will any measures be undertaken to assist organic farmers in Ireland?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When funding of this nature is allocated to growers, is the labour inspectorate involved in inspecting facilities where the potential for abuse of labour standards exists?  Given that moneys are expended by the taxpayer and it has been documented that exploitation has taken place within this industry, is there interdepartmental co-operation on the issue of exploitation of labour in the sector?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have a procedural question.  On a number of occasions, the time for questions has been changed.  While we are happy to facilitate that process, I respectfully ask that in future we should keep to a more constant timeframe.
