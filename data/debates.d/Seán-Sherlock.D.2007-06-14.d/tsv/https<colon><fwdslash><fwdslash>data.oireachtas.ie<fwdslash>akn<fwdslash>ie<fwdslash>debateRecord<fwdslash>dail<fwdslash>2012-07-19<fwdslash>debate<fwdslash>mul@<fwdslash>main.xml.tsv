SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The mandate of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is to develop Ireland's human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavour relevant to the future competitiveness of Irish industry and enterprise.  It carries out this task by funding world-class research teams in our higher education institutions focussing on the areas of information and communications technologies, biotechnology and sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies.The core outputs of SFI's activities are the range of world-class research teams in place, with indicators of their international rankings, taking into account the extent of their linkages with other research groups and with industry partners and the amount of funding leveraged from other sources.While direct job support is not the core task of SFI, it should be noted that at the end of 2011 SFI funding was directly supporting 2,995 top-class research positions across Irish higher education institutions and these researchers leveraged €90m in non-Exchequer funding to Ireland last year.A major impact attributable to SFI has been, and continues to be, its underpinning role for the enterprise and job creation activities of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland (EI). SFI funded research activities are focal points of attraction for foreign direct investment in Ireland whilst also assisting the EI client base to maintain and grow employment levels, and also enhance their sales and exports capacity.In 2011 the SFI funded research teams collaborated with 583 distinct companies, the majority of which are EI and IDA clients and which employ in excess of an estimated 82,000 people in Ireland.Over the past number of years the SFI investment has helped to significantly enhance IDA Ireland's new client wins capacity.  This can be evidenced by the fact that in 2004 the value of the foreign direct investment approvals achieved by the IDA that were research, development and innovation (RD&I) based amounted to €120m whilst the comparable 2011 level was €700m, a level nearly six times greater.  This is a significant indicator of the strong research capacity that SFI, along with other research funders, has helped to develop in Ireland in recent years.Through the quality of our human capital and the excellence of our research, Ireland has succeeded in attracting some of the most innovative companies in the world. For example:9 of the Top 10 Pharmaceutical companies in the world now have operations here.Similarly 15 of the Top 25 Medical Devices companies now have operations in Ireland;As do 8 of the Top 10 global Technology companies; and10 of the world's top selling drugs are produced in Ireland.In terms of SFI activity in 2012, the capital funding provision of €156m this year will allow the Foundation to maintain its support to 28 top-class research centres whilst also supporting a cohort of approximately 3,000 researcher positions.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	This matter was formally reviewed by my Department through Forfás which commissioned an expert report by consultants Georgia Tech in 2001 to examine the case for Irish participation in a number of intergovernmental research organisations including CERN.  That Report concluded that because of high costs and limited industrial development returns membership should not be pursued at that time.  Since then, of course, the severely depleted resources which this Government inherited has meant that there is an even greater imperative to ensure that publicly funded research and development will yield the maximum benefits for the country — most particularly in terms of downstream jobs.  Ireland's membership of international research organisations is reviewed on a regular basis and in the case of the European Space Agency, for example, the value of membership in terms of support to Irish companies and researchers is considered to justify the costs of our membership.CERN is a major international project which deservedly has received much attention in recent weeks arising from major and exciting discoveries.  It is important to note that Irish researchers are not precluded from participating in and benefiting from the work being done at CERN.  In an ideal world, of course it would be desirable to be involved in this major project, based in Europe as it is.  The issue is whether we should divert very scarce, and in most cases committed funding, away from the areas that we had identified as having the best chance of contributing to our economic recovery.  The costs of full membership are understood to be over €10m per annum.  While other associate membership options may be available involving lesser amounts, the issue remains that a decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved as payment of any fees would mean that less funding is available for our existing research priorities.  Should budgetary circumstances change the matter could be reviewed again but only if there is a compelling business case from a cost/benefit viewpoint.
