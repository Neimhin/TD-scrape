SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Members on this side of the House are not seeking to play politics with this issue but we question, as is our right, the decision by Amgen and the Government's response to it. The company has had two postponements.  On 15 October, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin met with Amgen.  The people of Carrigtwohill and the region want to find out what the future holds for Amgen.  Is it in a position to state whether it will proceed with the plant?  If anybody is to be accused of playing politics with this issue it is the members of the Minister's party and his backbenchers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What about the €4 million?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We all accept the vagaries of the international market, that negotiations are delicate and that landmark projects of this nature sometimes do not proceed.  If Amgen is retaining ownership of the site, the people of the region will want to know why it is doing so when they have postponed the project twice.  Is the Minister continuing negotiations with Amgen?  Will Amgen make a final decision on its intentions in a reasonable time?  The people of the region want to know where Amgen is going?  If it does not locate within the site will someone else do so?Given that €4 million has been expended to attract this industry, a legitimate question hangs over the use of taxpayers' money to attract industry.  The Amgen project could be used as a benchmark for foreign direct investment projects throughout the country and for global trends in industries of that nature.  If the global financial and economic infrastructure is changing and Amgen can make a sudden decision of this nature, questions must be posed regarding the nature of foreign direct investment throughout Ireland.  That is why we are asking these questions.
