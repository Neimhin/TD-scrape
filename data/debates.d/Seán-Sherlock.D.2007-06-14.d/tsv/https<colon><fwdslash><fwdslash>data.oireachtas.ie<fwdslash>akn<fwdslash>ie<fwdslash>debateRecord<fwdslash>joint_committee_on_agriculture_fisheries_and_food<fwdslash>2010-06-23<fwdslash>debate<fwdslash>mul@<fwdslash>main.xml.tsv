[<p eid="para_45">I welcome the gentlemen appearing before the committee.  In regard to the funding stream, what is the net financial position for Bord na gCon which includes the horse and greyhound fund of €11.8 million, the €5.5 million which is ploughed back in, and the delegation stated that it received €6.2 million directly from off-course bookmakers at the end of the year?</p>, <p eid="para_46">My second question relates to what I would regard as some degree of semantics being employed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in respect of litters.  In regard to point 20 of its submission, will the delegation outline  the permutations?  The submission states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_47">This is presented as a concession but is in fact a folly of wasted human and financial resource.  [That is strong language, it is vociferous and direct.]  I cannot see the difference between the previously proposed one litter every 12 months and the new concession of a maximum of three litters every 36 months in terms of the ability of a small breeder to earn a living.</p>, <p eid="para_48">I can see the sense of what the delegation is saying there. I do not understand what the Minister is at and perhaps we need to see some common sense being employed.</p>, <p eid="para_49">If I am not mistaken I understand the Minister may have written to the Taoiseach outlining some of the concerns and he may have said that part of his justification is that it will address concerns relating to situations where a bitch might not fall pregnant within a 12-month period.  The Minister said he proposed a minor modification to the definition of a dog breeding establishment, allowance of three litters over three years, subject to veterinary advice, providing that the provision of a maximum of six litters in the lifetime of a bitch would be retained, and, second, that he would alter the definition of breeding establishments and extend the four-month age threshold to six months.  He further stated that the change of the definition to six months will allow further time for owners of a new born litter of pups to decide whether to sell or retain the pups.  He stated also that, heretofore, once the pups reached four months of age and were capable of breeding, each bitch pup would have been reckonable for registration purposes and that his amendment effectively extends this period to six months.</p>, <p eid="para_50">I would like to get a view from Bord na gCon on that proposal because it speaks for itself.</p>, <p eid="para_51">The third issue relates to the inspection regime, the persons who are envisaged to be nominated as inspectors.  In this regard the Minister stated that to allay this concern he proposes to provide a facility whereby representatives of IBG ICC would accompany local authority veterinary inspectors on their visits.  He also proposes to restrict the personnel who are authorised to issue an improvement order to local authority veterinary inspectors.  The authorisation process is the nub of this issue and the ability to issue an improvement order to local authority veterinary inspectors.  Is it the view of the delegation that it will only be local authority veterinary inspectors or could there be other such persons as designated by the Minister who may not have the necessary qualifications, medical or otherwise to be able to make proper inspections?  There are concerns within the industry particularly among small breeders and owners as to how that might pan out.  Is there still concern that animal welfare groups could become part of that process and that there is still scope through ministerial direction or secondary legislation to effect that?</p>]
