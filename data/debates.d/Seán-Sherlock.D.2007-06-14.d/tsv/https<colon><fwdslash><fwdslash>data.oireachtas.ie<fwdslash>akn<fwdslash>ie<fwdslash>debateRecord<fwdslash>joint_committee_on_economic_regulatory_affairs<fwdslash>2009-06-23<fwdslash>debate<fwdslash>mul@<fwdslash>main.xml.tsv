[<p eid="para_113">I join other members in welcoming the regulator.  Will she clarify the extent of her powers and competences?  Is she saying she does not have the authority to impose a moratorium on the issuance of licences and that it is a matter for the Government or the Minister?  Is she saying she has no power even to make recommendations in that regard?</p>, <p eid="para_114">Ms Doyle referred to the new CD and manual.  Will she clarify that from 1 July, new entrants to the market will have to undergo a more rigorous examination than is currently the case?  Will existing licence holders have to take a revised examination?  Driver knowledge is still severely lacking, particularly in Dublin.  For a culchie such as myself who uses the city taxi service intermittently, to have to explain how to get to Coolock or another suburb indicates a serious lack of knowledge among some drivers.  What is the regulator's view of the situation in London, where there is a rigorous examination process for drivers, with applicants having to undergo several examination stages before a licence is granted?  Knowledge of the city is of paramount importance for London taxi drivers.  Does the regulator envisage similar requirements being put in place in the future for Dublin taxi drivers?</p>, <p eid="para_115">I understand the CD and manual include a skills development programme.  I admit to some scepticism in this regard.  If I were a new entrant to the taxi industry driving around Mallow town, for example, the likelihood of me taking three or four hours to read a manual and listen to a CD would be slim.  What information do these tools contain that will add qualitatively to one's experience as a taxi driver?  What was the cost of producing them?</p>, <p eid="para_116">I represent a constituency that has a rural and urban mix.  It is characterised by provincial towns, some of which are almost satellites of Cork city.  While some of these towns do not have town councils, those which do, such as Mallow, Fermoy, Cobh, Midleton and Youghal, are encountering problems because of the increase in the number of licences.  It is simply impossible to provide additional spaces in taxi ranks in certain town centres and an increase of two or three licences per annum in a town such as Mallow is significant in terms of the number of people who are plying for trade in off-peak hours.  The issue is causing tension among traffic wardens and taxi licence holders.  Incumbent drivers who work on a full-time basis see new entrants who are driving part time or not parking correctly.  Is the regulator liaising with local authorities in regard to rectifying problems of this nature?</p>, <p eid="para_117">No mention was made in the presentation of the number of plates issued to cater for people with disabilities.  The Labour Party published a document which recommended an initial target of making 20% of the fleet wheelchair accessible by 2012 and a longer term objective of 100% accessibility.  How near is the current fleet to meeting these targets?</p>]
[<p eid="para_119">I want to challenge the language used by Ms Doyle.  She stated that there was a decline in the rate of new entrants relative to last year but the number of licences being issued is increasing.  In County Cork, the number of licensed vehicles has increased from 2,238 to 2,382 and driver licences have increased from 4,285 to 4,555.  She asserts that light touch regulation is the way to go and that the market should be allowed to settle into its own equilibrium.  If I follow through on the logic of her argument, the rate of increase will probably drop to zero or 0.1%.  Then the market will find its equilibrium.  At the end of the day, it will have major consequences for the livelihood of people in full-time employment.  It will have major consequences for smaller towns throughout the country which are not able to deal with the extra capacity.  In towns such as Mallow, where more than 50 licences have been issued, the number of taxis is having a major impact on traffic movement in the town and is causing major tension for the existing licence holders.  The regulator may say that the market will find its own level but the market is imperfect because one cannot apply the permutations of the market evenly across the country because of topography and geography.</p>, <p eid="para_120">The regulator may talk about Washington DC, which is a major metropolitan area, but when considering the issuance of licences in Ireland, one must take account of having too many licences in certain parts of the country.  That is my central point.  One has to factor that into the model when issuing licences.  One cannot take a global figure and apply it globally because of the other factors that are not being taken into account.</p>]
[<p eid="para_122">Has the regulator refused a licence on the basis of the negative permutations of adding one extra licence in a smaller town?</p>]
[<p eid="para_124">How does the regulator propose to tackle the issue as part of her review if one does not propose the number of licences that will be issued?</p>]
