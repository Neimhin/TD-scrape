With a certain degree of collective responsibility in mind, it is perhaps an indictment of how the political system engages vis-à-vis protecting the rights of children in this State. My head is slightly hung down on this one because there is a certain sense of embarrassment or shame that the political system has not prioritised the care of our children within the State to the extent that it should. As a Member of the Dáil for ten years at this stage, I also consider myself partly responsible for that to a certain extent. As an individual and a new member to this committee, care of children has not been in the top echelons of political priorities. I say that in a honest and open fashion. In the short time available to me, I wish to speak to Molly's case. I am startled that there are 471 children with severe disabilities who are in foster care, in de facto State care, who need additional supports but who are fighting for those additional supports. I am aware of one case in my own area. Did Molly have a care plan? My understanding is that every child should now have a care plan and that care plan should be followed up upon. If Molly did have a care plan, why was that not acted upon? Whose responsibility was that? 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:30:00+00:00	The irony of this is that the person representing the agency that was supposed to provide and enact the care plan was so frustrated that she gave advice to Molly's foster mother. I am delighted that Ms McKenna-Keane is using the term "foster mother" because she was caring for her since the age of four months.I am making a kind of aside here but we do not see them as integral to the care of the child in question. They are always living in the fear that the child could be taken from them at any point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	The key point here is there was a care plan in place but the resources did not follow the care plan. It is the key point in Molly's case.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	There are 471 children. In the short time I have, I am trying to drill down into whether the 471 children spoken of in the report are now in the same position as Molly, with the same risk profile pertaining to those children.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	I would like some forbearance. There was no guardian ad litem in this instance. Is it not the case that there is a serious flaw in the system, where children with severe disabilities not the subject of court cases and availing of the guardian ad litem scenario are already at a disadvantage relative to other children in foster care who are the subject of court cases? The case must now be made that every child with a disability - whether it is a severe, moderate or intellectual disability - in foster care should have a guardian ad litem to advocate independently and ensure those agencies, including Tusla and the HSE, will deliver on those rights.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	Is this down to a turf war between two agencies?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	It is a turf war and the kids get caught in the middle. That is the bottom line.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-01-16T14:35:00+00:00	I thank the ombudsman as he has done us a great service with this report. The Molly case has really opened the eyes of many of us with respect to fostering services and the deficits that exist.
