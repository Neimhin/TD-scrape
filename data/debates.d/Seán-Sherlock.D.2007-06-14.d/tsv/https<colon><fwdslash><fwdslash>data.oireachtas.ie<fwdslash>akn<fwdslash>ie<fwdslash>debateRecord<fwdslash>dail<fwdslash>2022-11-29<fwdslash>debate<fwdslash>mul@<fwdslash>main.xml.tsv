[<p eid="para_691">There were to be three speakers in this slot but only two are present so Deputy Ó Cathasaigh may use the remainder of the slot.</p>]
[<p eid="para_733">The Minister is entitled to reply to the debate without interruption.</p>]
[<p eid="para_735">I ask that all speakers be respected and that the Minister be allowed to continue without interruption.</p>]
[<p eid="para_741">Sorry Minister, may I intervene for a second? As Deputy McGrath sits in this Chair from time to time, may I ask him please, if he cannot respect the speaker, to respect the Chair.</p>]

[<p eid="para_962">I totally agree that the role of the community welfare office is a vital one, so let us all put that to bed. I want to see more of them, and more of them within our communities meeting people face to face. There are 50 Intreo offices but if there are only 50 Intreo offices they can only cover a narrow geographical area. The impediment is that there are not enough community welfare officers interfacing with people on the ground. Is the Minister satisfied that every resident of the State has access, as needs be, to a CWO?</p>]
[<p eid="para_967">I appreciate the Minister's commitment to service. I welcome the fact that the discretionary nature of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is set out in statute, covers everything from household bills to child-related payments, clothing, funeral expenses and other general expenses, housing expenses, illness expenses and a multitude of other urgent needs payments. I welcome the assurances by the Minister - if I interpret her correctly - that she is going to protect those, and that no element of those that are non-statutory will be taken away. It is vital that the discretionary element of the payments be maintained.</p>, <p eid="para_968"> There is a point we are trying to make here to the Minister. If I move outside my constituency, let us consider the Navan Road for example. An area that covered Cabra, Navan Road, Phibsboro, Stoneybatter-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_970">This is now a service where people are being forced into the Parnell Street office. It takes the service further away from the people. Will the Minister give an undertaking to conduct an analysis of the community welfare service as it relates to every part of the country? This will tell us whether the service is being delivered equally to all citizens.</p>]
[<p eid="para_973">I welcome that additional staff are being deployed. As someone who represents both an urban and rural constituency, I want to see the traditional, old-style, face-to-face interaction, and I believe that many others share this view. I take the point made by the Minister around the right of people to have access to a person where they can make an appointment.</p>, <p eid="para_974">If, however, the caseload is 75,000 applications, give or take, per annum, if I interpret the Minister correctly, and if the staff quotient is about 412, the caseload per officer is increasing, and it has become more centralised into hubs. The local discretion is being taken away and the number of officers in more remote areas is decreasing. That is my contention based on my first-hand experience. It is more an observation than a question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_976">I know that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1013">How will the scheme announced under the Social Welfare Act 2020 in respect of uilleannn pipe makers work in practical terms?</p>, <p eid="para_1014">The Minister will recall that I very much welcomed this in the context of the Social Welfare Bill, which is before the House, and I tried to make a play for the hurley makers in a similar vein on the basis that the two are connected by dint of their status under UNESCO tangible heritage status. </p>, <p eid="para_1015"> My question relating to hurley makers was disallowed so I am chancing my arm in asking this question and raising the question of hurling again but I would genuinely like to know how this scheme will work in practical terms and if there is any scope for the hurley makers of Ireland to be included in a similar scheme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1017">Gabh mo leithscéal. I did not hear the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1022">I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection is very influential at the Cabinet so I implore her, following this discussion, to raise the issue with her colleague the Minister for Finance. With regard to hurling, there is a crisis with ash dieback at present and we seriously want to preserve the craft of hurley making.</p>, <p eid="para_1023"> My own thinking on UNESCO intangible heritage status was influenced by no less a Clareman than Mr. Daniel McCarthy, who did a lot of work in the background in seeking such status. There have been many people involved in this for many years. I welcome the Minister's response.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1025">I welcome the Minister's response to this and the Government's proactive approach to encouraging the craft of uilleann pipe making and its making of provisions in the tax code to ensure the survival of the craft. If the Government were of a mind to consider other crafts such as hurley making, it would be very much welcomed. If the Minister wishes to take up the cudgel or the hurl on that, she would have the support of all of us here.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1180">The union SIPTU has brought to our attention a notice of strike action at Zenith Energy Bantry Bay Terminal Limited. That strike is to take place on Tuesday, 13 December. The Whiddy Island terminal has 17 oil storage tanks with a capacity of almost 9 million barrels and stores a significant portion of the State's oil reserves. It is a key reference site nationally. The National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, is the State body with responsibility for maintaining our strategic supplies of oil and is one of the Whiddy terminal's largest customers. Whiddy Island was originally built in the late 1960s by Gulf Oil to accommodate ultra large crude oil-carrying vessels. We all remember the tragic accident where 51 people died in January 1979 when the oil tanker <i>Betelgeuse</i> exploded.</p>, <p eid="para_1181"> In July 2001, the business and commercial assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC, were sold to Tosco corporation, now Conoco Phillips, and NORA did not form part of that transaction. Tosco was later acquired by Phillips 66. NORA was established as an independent statutory body in 2007 upon the introduction of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act. The Whiddy terminal was then sold to Zenith in 2015. In 2020, there were reports that Zenith intended to sell the strategic facility. At the time up to 50 staff were employed at the facility in January 2020, but no sale occurred.</p>, <p eid="para_1182"> I will quote directly from the statement issued by SIPTU. Willie Noone, the sector organiser, stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1183">A ballot for strike action was supported unanimously by our members and is scheduled to commence at 8.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 13th December. This action results from the decision of the company [Zenith] to dismiss workers with long service on Wednesday, 30th November, while planning to employ contractors on an ongoing basis to do their work.</p>, <p eid="para_1184"> The union, and the workers to their credit, see this as a last resort. The company is seeking compulsory redundancies. Efforts by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to resolve the dispute were unsuccessful as the company remains insistent that contractors be used to cover the work previously done by the workers being made redundant.</p>, <p eid="para_1185"> I am asking for the Government to intervene on the basis that Zenith is housed within a key reference site that ensures the security of energy supply of the State. I call on the Government to intervene now with Zenith to at least bring the company to a hearing of the Labour Court so that the matter might be resolved. No company on this island should seek to drive a coach and four through the industrial relations architecture that has been built up successfully over years, particularly at a time security of energy supply is so vital and particularly given that these people have a combined service of more than 100 years. We want to get them back to the table. I call on the Minister of State to use her good offices and those of the Government to intervene on this matter to encourage people back to the table.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1193">I am disappointed with the answer. The Whiddy Island terminal is fixed firmly in the consciousness of every citizen's mind as key in the security of energy supply.</p>, <p eid="para_1194">There would have been a time when somebody like me would have gotten up as a member of the Opposition to call on the Government to use its influence specifically in relation to a site like this. Zenith has a contract and owns the site. If they were driving a coach and four through the industrial relations architecture, an Opposition Deputy would have at least received a response that expressed sympathy with the workers down there. We do not want workers who have had long careers, have excellent skill sets, are highly competent and are highly trained to be replaced while they go out on strike by contractors who are coming in and ultimately are designed to take their place. There was a time in this House when a Minister would have stood opposite me and not given me the answer I have received tonight. </p>, <p eid="para_1195"> I know what NORA does. The dogs in the street know what NORA does. The dogs in the street can make the distinction between NORA and Zenith in this regard. I want to protect the rights of pre-existing workers who are being shovelled out the door by stealth. They are key workers for this island, given what they do at the terminal. I worry that if we lose their skill set, it will be gone and lost forever. I am merely calling for some sympathy and empathy on the part of the Government for the workers. There should be an acknowledgement by the Government of the need to call on all sides, particularly the owners of the company, to come back to the table - at least - as a starting point.</p>]
