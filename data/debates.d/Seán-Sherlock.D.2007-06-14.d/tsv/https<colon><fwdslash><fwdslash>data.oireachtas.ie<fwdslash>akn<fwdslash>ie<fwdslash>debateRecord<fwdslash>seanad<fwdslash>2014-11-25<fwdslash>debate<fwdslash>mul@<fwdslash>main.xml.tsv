[<p eid="para_430">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and apologise on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in the other Chamber. It is on that basis that I am taking this Adjournment debate. When the Senator replies, she might clarify whether it is the family's wish to have the person cared for in their home or a residential setting. According to the Minister of State's reply, she has been advised by the HSE that it is very aware of the family's wishes to care for the young person in question in their own home. We might obtain some clarification, not necessarily in the Senator's reply today. I acknowledge her points on the potential to seek residential care.</p>, <p eid="para_431"> For obvious reasons, we all want to protect the identity of the person concerned and I will not give the official answer, except to say the HSE's disability service in the local area has arranged a case review meeting in early December with her family and the relevant service provider.</p>, <p eid="para_432">I understand a previous meeting with the family was postponed as the HSE disability services manager had not had an opportunity to discuss her circumstances with the consultant neurologist. Every effort is being made in the girl's best interests to meet the complex needs articulated by her advocate, the Senator. I hope the meeting which will take place in early December will provide clarity.</p>]
[<p eid="para_435">Absolutely. The Senator can be assured that I will be talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, this evening. I will ensure the concerns raised by the Senator are transferred directly to the persons in question in order that they can pick up on the points made. Please be assured that I will meet the Minister of State and convey to her the request made by the Senator, as the advocate for the girl in question, to meet her to discuss the case.</p>]
[<p eid="para_437">I acknowledge the point. That is a given.</p>]
[<p eid="para_442">I acknowledge the issue raised by the Senator. I am taking this matter on the Adjournment on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is in the Dáil Chamber. I will not deliver the script provided.</p>, <p eid="para_443"> The issue raised by the Senator arises from an exceptional set of circumstances. I do not wish to say it is a complete outlier in cases presented to the HSE. I think anybody with a degree of fairness would acknowledge the individual in this case was not dealt with properly. It is obvious that there was a systems breakdown. I have been given a script, but I do not wish to state there is no role for the Minister for Health in this case, about which I will speak from the script that I have been given.</p>, <p eid="para_444"> I acknowledge the points made by the Senator about the fact that in the period from 2012 to date, the individual in question was locked out of the medical card system through no fault of their own. The question is why that happened. I am aware that the HSE has a protocol in place for a review process and that every effort is made to provide for ongoing engagement with clients during this process. That obviously did not happen in this case. Each month the HSE analyses the medical card register to identify those medical cards and GP visit cards scheduled for review within three months. That obviously did not happen in this instance.</p>, <p eid="para_445">Now all customers scheduled for review are notified and a balance of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted. That did not happen either in this instance. In this case, the HSE has confirmed that the medical card lapsed. However, the person's medical needs were provided for by a resident doctor, which the Senator has stated and expenses arising from medical appointments or drugs were funded by the service provider. I understand from the HSE that an application has been made, as the Senator has stated, to reinstate the person's medical card in 2014. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has asked the HSE to remind service providers of their responsibility to ensure such matters are attended to promptly in respect of residents in their care. I do not have an answer for the Senator on what happened in this case, but I fully support her plea on behalf of the client that there be a review of the structures that led to a situation where that person was not in receipt of a medical card if that person was entitled to one for a particular period.</p>, <p eid="para_446"> If I understand the Senator correctly, the medical card was cancelled but the family was not informed or was not in receipt of any documentation to that effect. To be frank, I think the very least the person is entitled to in this instance is some acknowledgement of that fact, but as Oireachtas Members we all, including me, have experience of circumstances where documentation has slipped through the cracks. I do not want to lay the blame on any particular entity, but a number of Oireachtas Members have sent in documentation to the service on behalf of various clients or constituents and it has got lost somewhere in the ether. I know from my own experience that service has been cleaned up considerably to be fair to the HSE and I am confident that this will continue, given today's announcement, for instance, but the case the Senator raises is worthy of further examination. I hope the most positive outcome would be an assurance that the person's medical card would be restored if that person is so entitled, as seems to be the case, but also that medical needs, most importantly, are taken care of.</p>]
[<p eid="para_448">I beg the Chair's and the Senator's indulgence to acknowledge that point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_451">I acknowledge the distinction the Senator has made. At the same time, historically there is a situation where the client - I know it is an awful word-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_453">I apologise if I am using inappropriate terminology, but I do not mean to offend anybody. A system or a protocol must be put in place. That is the essential point that is being made by the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_455">Where family members are informed. That is the key. From a HSE perspective, it generates a great deal of correspondence, but in this instance there is a certain responsibility on the HSE. That is my view. I will relay this matter to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on behalf of the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_467">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who sends her apologies, I thank the Senator for raising the issue today. As he may be aware, in the light of public safety concerns highlighted by An Garda Síochána and difficulties in the interpretation of the legislation expressed by members of the Judiciary, a joint working group of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda was established to review the firearms licensing process. I appreciate that states the obvious, but it is important to record it in the House. The report of the working group was published on 13 November and submissions on the report have been sought from stakeholders and the public. The deadline for the receipt of submissions is 31 January 2015. The consultation process provides individuals and groups with the opportunity to contribute to the development of firearms policy and legislation and will enable consideration to be given to the future direction of such legislation. The Minister has already given a commitment not to make any decision until she has had the opportunity to consider all the submissions which are made and met the key stakeholders, including the organisations who represent those who use firearms for sporting purposes. The Minister urges all concerned to engage with this process so that their views can be considered before final decisions are made in relation to this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_468"> In so far as the issue of the Garda Commissioner's guidelines is concerned, I understand the Senator is referring to Annex F of same on the practical application and operation of the Firearms Acts. The Garda Commissioner has made a decision with ministerial consent to issue new Garda guidelines on the Firearms Acts which exclude the former Annex F. The interpretation of the previous Annex F had caused difficulties and confusion in regard to applications for firearm certificates for .22 calibre handguns and has resulted in more than 30 judicial review applications to date. The Senator has made reference to this state of affairs. There have been no changes to either primary or secondary legislation as a result of amending the guidelines.</p>, <p eid="para_469"> Deciding officers in An Garda Síochána have been formally notified this month that all applications for licences for non-restricted handguns shall be considered under the current legislation which is SI 21 of 2008, as amended by SI 337 of 2009. Interest groups, including representatives of the sports coalition, were notified earlier this month of both the new Garda guidelines without Annex F and the current position that, in effect, a negative decision for a licence for .22 calibre handgun is a refusal of the application which allows for an appeal of that decision to the District Court.</p>, <p eid="para_470"> To summarise a key point on behalf of the Minister, I note that no decision will be made on the matter until such time as she has had an opportunity to consider the submissions and has met the key stakeholders.</p>]
[<p eid="para_474">I concur with the points being made by the Senator. I represent an urban-rural constituency and have held a shotgun in my time for the same purposes as many people who live in rural Ireland in respect of countryside pursuits. While I concur with the view that the perception within the lobby that there has been a heavy-handed approach must be addressed, I take in good faith the words of the Minister when she says she will sit down with the stakeholders. It is something everyone on the Government side of the House has advocated.</p>, <p eid="para_475"> In fairness, the Senator has mentioned Mr. Des Crofton. Mr. Crofton's organisation is prodigious and consists of upstanding citizens. I know these people and have engaged and interacted with them. The Senator mentioned the 2006 Act and if one looks at the way in which Mr. Crofton and company have interacted with the 2009 Act, there is no doubt but that they have acted absolutely in good faith and continue to do so. It is in all of our interests to chart a course that will ensure there is a successful outcome and that we recognise the value of these lobbies within Irish society.</p>]
