[<p eid="para_607">I acknowledge the Minister's response, in which he referred to the importance of the scheme.  Given that more than 50,000 farmers participate in the scheme while 32,000 have participated in Teagasc training and the budget is approximately €250 million, would the Minister not consider increasing the payment from €40 to €60 per head in the coming year because of the difficulties faced by farmers due to recent adverse weather conditions and the state of the market?  Farmers have a deep commitment to the scheme but given the reduction in their incomes, an increase in this payment next year would provide a major buttress against loss of earnings in the current climate.</p>]
[<p eid="para_610">I appreciate the Minister's answer.  I speak to this issue because of the current importance of the export market.  It is a very productive sector and any inputs now or in the next two years will be vital to maintaining productivity and market share.  There is a logic to maintaining the scheme.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment to maintain the scheme and to review the payment.  The Minister mentioned the ICBF.  Its recent research, as indicated in the <i>Irish Farmers’ Journal</i> of last week, suggests that the cow herd has shrunk by 6% this year.  That could have negative implications for the future of the export market.  </p>, <p eid="para_611">Is the Minister engaging with the farm organisations to, at least, maintain the scheme and to ensure, if there is a reduction from €80, that payment will continue to those farmers under the scheme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_675">I posed this question on the last occasion the Minister answered questions and I got the exact same answer as he has imparted to Deputy Cregan.  I note he said that a meeting took place on 2 November.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  Will the stakeholder group, the consultative group, engage in a reporting procedure to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in order that we can be in a position to monitor the nature of deliberations therein?</p>]
[<p eid="para_678">We are aware of the importance of the abolition of quotas.  This is why we have called for consultation and an act of participation.  It is important that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would feed into that process in some way.  It is also important that we are notified of the ongoing nature of the consultations.  Did the Minster invite Teagasc to the last meeting?  Is the scientific community involved in this process as an active participant?  When I put the question in October, I was informed it would be invited.</p>]

[<p eid="para_783">Concerns have been expressed to me about a proposal to close a branch office of the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership in Mallow.  Some members of the board are concerned about the proposal because the office in Mallow supervises the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, and rural transport programme.  I attest to the good work done by the office which has been in operation since 1996.  I also share the concerns communicated to me by board members about the closure of the office as it will create significant potential for a diminution of the service provided in the Mallow and north Cork region.</p>, <p eid="para_784">I am also concerned that proposals have been made by the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership to instigate a round of voluntary redundancies in advance of any announcement in the budget of a reduction of a ministerial budget line for such groups to provide services.  I am further concerned about certain corporate governance issues which arise as a result of the decision to which I refer.  At the most recent board meeting of the Blackwater Avondhu Partnership, it was communicated to members that no decision had been made on the closure of the Mallow office or on seeking a round of voluntary redundancies.  Despite this, staff have been notified that the office will close and a voluntary redundancy package will be offered.  They must give their decisions on the package by next Monday.</p>, <p eid="para_785">Has the Minister given a direction to the partnership that the office in Mallow should close?  Has the board or chief executive officer communicated to the Department an intention to seek voluntary redundancies?  Has the Department communicated with the partnership about the need to seek redundancies and close one of its operational centres, namely, the Mallow office?</p>, <p eid="para_786">I ask that the Department give the board of Blackwater Avondhu Partnership an undertaking that all rules and regulations pertaining to corporate governance procedures will be adhered to as regards the responsibilities of the board, as distinct from the chief executive officer.  I also ask that the Department issue guidance to the board in this respect.</p>, <p eid="para_787">The individuals who communicated with me are board members.  While some of them vehemently oppose the closure of the Mallow office, they accept the argument that if rationalisation is required services will be moved to another office in Fermoy.  They seek to ensure that the process applied to staff members in the Mallow office is completely transparent, the wishes of board members are observed and no person or persons act in a unilateral fashion.  The reason I saw fit to raise this issue is that concern has arisen about the actions of some individuals with regard to the continuation of services in Mallow.  I share this concern.</p>, <p eid="para_788">While I accept that we live in constrained times and the amalgamation of two entities sometimes causes one entity to suffer, I am adamant that the LDSIP, a phenomenally successful programme, should continue within the amalgamated structure.  The rural transport programme, which delivers excellent services, should also continue, as should the other services such as those at the Mallow office.</p>]
