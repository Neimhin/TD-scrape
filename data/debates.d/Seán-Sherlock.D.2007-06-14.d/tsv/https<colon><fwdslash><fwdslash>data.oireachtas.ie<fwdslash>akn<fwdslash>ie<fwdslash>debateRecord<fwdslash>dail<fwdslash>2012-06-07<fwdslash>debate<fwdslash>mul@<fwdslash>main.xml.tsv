SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The procurement innovation group's report and the accompanying 10 Step Guide to Smart Procurement and SME Access to Public Contracts were both published in July 2009.  Some of the recommendations were incorporated subsequently into the Department of Finance's current guidelines to public contracting authorities which are designed to ensure tendering processes operate in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs.  These include the lowering, from €50,000 to €25,000, of the estimated value of contracts to be advertised on the e-tenders website, the splitting of larger contracts into lots, and the communication by contracting authorities of future procurement plans by issuing prior information notices.  None the less, it is clear that more effort must be made to ensure the guidelines are applied by procurement officers in contracting authorities, and work is under way to ensure this is happening.The action plan for jobs contains a number of specific measures designed to facilitate an increase in SME participation in the tendering process, and my Department is working collaboratively with key players such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Procurement Service, NPS, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to deliver the commitments as set out in the action plan.In addition, the Department chairs a steering group bringing together the main stakeholders in this area.  Under the aegis of the steering group, Enterprise Ireland, the National Procurement Service and InterTradeIreland are working on a number of initiatives to boost SME participation in the public procurement process, including, for example, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of clusters of SMEs to work with contracting authorities develop innovative supply chain solutions.  The aim is to establish a level playing field in the area of public procurement to facilitate increased SME participation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Specifically on the issue of public procurement, I refer the Deputy to the action plan for jobs.  Actions 3.49 to 3.54, inclusive, relate to pre-qualification criteria, the establishment of a mechanism to allow SMEs to engage with contracting authorities on issues of concern, the establishment by Enterprise Ireland of advisers and mentors to help client companies to prepare better public procurement opportunities, encouraging more SMEs to register on the Government's e-tenders website to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention, encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering by focusing on innovative solutions to procurement needs rather than specific products or services, and identifying a number of key procurement projects that will provide subcontracting and supply chain opportunities for SMEs.In terms of specific actions, a round table discussion on the advantages of innovative procurement through the procurement innovation initiative organised by the Department took place on 2 April 2012.  It was attended by senior procurement officials in public bodies and by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  A number of SMEs presented examples of innovative solutions they are already providing to public bodies.  Some public bodies have indicated specific, upcoming procurement projects that would be suitable for the procurement innovation initiative.  They included the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, the Department of Defence, the Health Service Executive, HSE, An Post and the ESB.  Given the time constraints I will refer the Deputy to the specific actions in that regard.InterTradeIreland also organised popular "Go-2-Tender" training workshops.  The workshops give SMEs the skills to tender successfully for public sector contracts on an all-island basis.  Three were held in the past three months, involving more than 70 SMEs, including one held in Cork.  A further three workshops are due to be held in Enniskillen, Armagh and Waterford before the end of July.  An advanced "Go-2-Tender" workshop was held in April-May and another is planned for later this year.  There is constant engagement by Enterprise Ireland with contracting authorities to raise awareness of innovative ideas and capabilities of SMEs to provide innovative solutions to their specific needs.  We have moved well beyond the 2009 report, and the action plan for jobs has clear action deliverables in terms of public procurement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Government's jobs initiative of May 2011 was aimed at restoring confidence in the economy, providing opportunities for re-skilling those who had lost jobs and assisting people in getting back to work.  Key measures in the jobs initiative included halving the rate of employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week, a reduction in the lower rate of VAT on certain goods and services, targeted capital spending on labour-intensive projects, and the introduction of the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  Additional education and training places were also provided for those seeking to upskill.The impact of these measures is being seen across a range of sectors, but particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors where the latest quarterly national household survey, published today, shows a year-on-year increase of 8,700 in the numbers employed in the accommodation and food service sectors.  Almost 7,500 interns have commenced placements under the JobBridge programme since it was launched last July.  Feedback from the Department of Social Protection indicates that 966 of the 2,575 people who have already completed JobBridge have gone directly into employment with the host organisation or elsewhere.  More than 3,500 people recently graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, recently announced a further roll-out of the Springboard initiative with an additional 6,000 places in 2012.The Government has built on the jobs initiative this year with its action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work strategy, adding a significant range of actions to promote employment and assist those seeking work.  Pathways to Work places a particular focus on the long-term unemployed, while the new €20 million labour market education and training fund will include specific provision for those under 25 years of age.  FÁS has issued a call for expressions of interest from training and education providers in regard to this fund.In the three years prior to the Government taking office, more than 300,000 jobs were lost.  This scale of job loss cannot be reversed overnight, but we are systematically delivering on the commitments we made in the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work.  While employment may fluctuate from quarter to quarter in this transition phase of our economic recovery, the significant job announcements since January - which include BSkyB, Mylan, Apple, Eli Lilly, PayPal and others - point to the return of a level of confidence in the Irish economy that will translate into an increase in the number of people in employment as the jobs come on stream.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	On Deputy Brendan Smith's question, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has informed me there is no difficulty with an engagement between the Department and the company to which the Deputy referred.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Yes.  A dialogue can be entered into in that respect.On the question of whether the jobs initiatives introduced by the Government are proving a success, the central point is that this is a ship which will take a long time to turn around.  We acknowledge the figures and are bold and honest enough not to bury our heads in the sand in that regard.  We are seeking to implement a set of policy prerogatives in the form of labour market activation measures and education-related measures.  The latter include JobBridge, Pathways to Work and Springboard, while the former includes the extension of the PRSI incentive scheme in a way that incentivises employers to engage employees and interns.  We are also concerned with identifying skills shortages and seeking to address those through the education sphere.  All of that will take time.On the procurement issue, the action plan for jobs includes a range of deliverables for the end of 2012, to which I respectfully ask Deputy Peadar Tóibín to have regard.  If he does not accept what I am saying, he should speak with representatives of the State agencies tasked with these actions, who will demonstrate the actions they are undertaking at the behest of the Government.  There is a reporting mechanism attached to the deliverables which sees the Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs reporting directly to the Taoiseach.  It is not at all accurate to say our activities in this regard are based merely on aspiration.  With respect to the Deputy, my response pointed to the clear action points we are driving in regard to procurement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	In July 2011 my proposals for reform of consumer and competition legislation were approved by Government.  These embodied two commitments given in the Programme for Government, namely, the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority and the introduction of a legislative base for a code of practice in the grocery sector.  In addition, the proposals gave effect to the recommendation of the advisory group on media mergers and updated certain elements of competition and consumer law.Under the proposals, responsibility for the application of the public interest test in respect of media mergers will transfer to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The consolidation of the various elements of consumer and competition law into a single Act is entirely in keeping with the principles of better regulation and with the trend within Government to consolidate and simplify legislation for ease of reference for all users.All of the elements of the package are important measures to be delivered.  I see no benefit in progressing a stand-alone item of legislation for one element, to be followed in due course by a more comprehensive package of reforms.  I expect the consumer and competition Bill to be published later this year.The Dáil adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 June 2012.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Driving export growth is central to our economic recovery and it is a key focus of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs. Enterprise Ireland (EI) has established a new Potential Exporters Division, a key measure in the Action Plan for Jobs.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international market place. The new unit provides assistance designed to aid client companies investigate, prepare and execute an international strategy including:Practical business advice, information and market intelligence,Targeted funding supports where appropriate,Suitable training and development.So far this year EI has held six Export Awareness Events around the country with the next one taking place on 12th June.  Approximately 200 companies have attended these events with more than 1,200 companies contacted and invited.  EI has commenced a number of two day "Exploring Exporting" workshops with over 40 companies participating.  Further events and workshops will continue to be rolled out during the year.Enterprise Ireland's 29 overseas offices and international networks have an important role to play in the internationalisation of EI's established and start-up client companies, through positioning them to meet the needs of specific international market and guiding them in the right direction regarding market contacts and introductions to potential buyers.  Through this network, EI clients have secured 294 new buyers this year, while 316 buyers have been attracted to engage with indigenous companies on international business opportunities.Another essential support to underpin the export ambitions of SMEs is developing a wider network of EU Free Trade Agreements. These agreements increase market access for our exporters by reducing barriers to trade and investment, encourage the mutual recognition of EU standards so that technical barriers to trade are removed and generally make it easier and less costly for our exporters to trade. We are coming up to the first anniversary, on 1 July, when the first major FTA with Korea came into effect to improve market access to this powerful Asian economy. Other agreements are being negotiated with Canada, Singapore and Malaysia while talks about improving market access to Vietnam have just started. All these are markets that have been identified as priority markets in our Trade, Tourism and Investment strategy.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	"SWiFT 10 Adopting the Cloud — decision support for Cloud computing" is designed to provide guidance toall organisations, both large and small, on the various issues that need to be considered when moving to the Cloud. Cloud computing is a key sector identified in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the development of this SWiFT by National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) marks the delivery of a Q2 measure under the Action Plan."SWiFT 10:" was launched on 21 May 2012. The Irish Internet Association disseminated information on the SWiFT to the 6,500 subscribers of their Newsletter and 12,500 followers on Twitter. Both mainstream and IT specialist media reported on the Launch.It is intended for use as a means of assessing Cloud adoption prioritisation and suitability. The SWiFT guidance will support organisations to thoroughly assess the practical suitability of Cloud computing across the gamut of their business operations.  It includes a thorough review of all legal, security, maturity and cost/benefit considerations.SMEs in particular will be receptive to this SWiFT, as they are looking to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, increase agility and open up new avenues.Recent research indicates that while SMEs are convinced of the merits of the Cloud, they are hesitant to take those first steps. SWiFT 10 will guide business owners and managers through the process and assist them in making the appropriate decisions and setting the right course for their Cloud adoption strategy.SWiFT 10 helps organisations determine whether Cloud is a right fit for them or not. It provides not only a starting point for businesses considering Cloud, it guides them through all the features that need to be considered when adopting Cloud and helps organisations large and small assess the risks and more importantly the benefits for their business at a small cost of less than €20.In this regard this SWiFT will clear some of the confusion which may be hampering Cloud adoption and provide a means of promoting and encouraging greater adoption among Irish SMEs. It is not possible at this stage to put a number on the SMEs that will avail of the SWiFT 10 guidance.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 29 together.My Department, through the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offer a range of supports to assist and enable entrepreneurs and enterprises to exploit the value of Intellectual Property (IP) and to engage in the optimal exploitation of research and development, and specifically in applying for patents.Reflecting Enterprise Ireland's enterprise development mission, the agency supports companies to be more competitive through innovation.  An output from this can be the creation of patented Intellectual Property (IP), however, measuring the resultant number of patent applications is not an effective metric to assess the output from these supports. This is because there are many alternative and often more appropriate ways for companies to capture and exploit their intellectual property.  For example, in the software sector patenting may be prohibited by patent law, therefore, copyright is a more common means of securing a company's intellectual assets.  Enterprise Ireland therefore does not set targets for the number of patents filed or for increases in the number of patents filed by its client companies. Enterprise Ireland's focus is on supporting businesses to be innovative and where this produces IP, the business is supported to use the most appropriate process to protect it, which can include patenting.Intellectual Property supports are integrated with the broader range of innovation supports provided by EI.  Under the R&D Fund companies, including HPSUs, can receive support for the costs of the early stages of patenting.  However, companies may determine that patenting is not the optimal means of protecting any new Intellectual Property and may rely, instead, on copyright, or non-disclosure and/or first mover advantage, depending on circumstances and sector.Considering the diversity of needs that the client base represents Enterprise Ireland also provides a number of non-financial supports to help companies to make the best Intellectual Property protection decisions based on their specific situation. In some circumstances the most effective way for a company to secure key IP (including patents) is not to develop it themselves but rather to licence or acquire it from another company or college.  Enterprise Ireland's Technology Transfer Executives working with the Enterprise Europe Network provide access to IP from a range of sources and support companies to transfer targeted IP into their companies.In terms of building the capability of Irish companies a joint exercise between Enterprise Ireland (with the Enterprise-Europe Network) and the Irish Patent Office ran a very successful campaign of events, under the heading "Building a Business on your ideas".  With support from the County Enterprise Boards and Institutes of Technology this initiative addressed an Innovation Task Force recommendation that, "An understanding of the importance of IP, its value and commercial potential should be strongly cultivated in the business community and Irish society at large".Recently Enterprise Ireland appointed an Intellectual Property Manager to strengthen the agency's resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property.In addition, the Patents Office provides a range of information supports to prospective patent applicants through the Office's websitewww.patentsoffice.ie including a detailed Patent Application Guide for applicants who wish to file a patent application without using the services of a patent agent.  To reduce patenting costs for applicants for Irish 20 year patents, the statutory fee for the search which is required in order to establish novelty and non-obviousness has been reduced from €361 to €200.The report of the IP Implementation Group is due to be published very shortly which will spell out a new national protocol aimed at encouraging the transfer of more IP into Irish companies from the third level sector.  Enterprise Ireland will play a central role in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.I am satisfied that national supports directed at Irish companies engaged in research, development and innovation will continue to result in new inventions that are patented adding further to economic growth and development.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	A number of agencies under the remit of my Department provide supports for research and development including Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver a world class standard of research activity in third level institutions and linked to Irish enterprises. Their Centres for Science, Engineering and Technology and Strategic Research Clusters help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry. Their Principal Investigator Programme supports those fields of science and engineering that underpin biotechnology, ICT and energy and their Research Frontiers Programme supports research in framework or integrative fields of science, engineering and mathematics that contribute educational benefit that will advance national scientific progress.Enterprise Ireland operates a suite of programmes to expand research capacity in companies, to increase collaboration between enterprise and the research sector and to maximise the commercialisation of the State's research investment. They offer 14 main initiatives for supporting research and development in businesses. Ireland's strengthened national research ecosystem has enhanced IDA's capacity to attract increased levels of high-value R&D projects and new RD&I investment approvals are playing a strategic role in embedding existing employment in FDI companies and setting the groundwork for increased future employment.The work of the enterprise agencies is underpinned by investments under the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions which is aimed at strengthening national research capabilities in human and physical infrastructure.There are a number of other programmes providing research and development supports delivered by other state agencies, funding for which is channelled through a number of other Government Departments, full details of which are outlined in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation Indicators Report published in December 2011 which is available on my Department's website.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 37 together.Under the Europe 2020 Strategy, the European Council adopted a number of headline targets, including improving the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 3% of GDP. In accordance with the Strategy, Member States have adopted national targets on the basis of these headline targets, as set out in their National Reform Programmes, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances. Ireland's National Reform Programme, transmitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011, specified that Ireland's 2020 target in relation to R&D is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP).The latest available data on total research and development expenditure in the State, known as Gross Expenditure on Research and Development (GERD), relates to the year 2010, and indicates that GERD as a percentage of GNP was 2.16% or 1.77% of GDP. Approximately two thirds of this expenditure is by the private sector.  The National Reform Programme outlined a number of assumptions to reach the target for expenditure on R&D by 2020, in relation to the period up to and including 2014, in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and subsequently on the basis of a return to sustainable growth domestically and a recovered global economy.  This growth will be driven through a continuation of a supportive fiscal environment for R&D investment as well as supports for higher education R&D, industry linkages with higher education researchers, commercialisation of research results, in-company R&D and start-up companies.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) was established in 2000 with a mission to build and strengthen Ireland's scientific and engineering research capacity and human capital in the areas of greatest strategic value to Ireland's long-term competitiveness and enterprise development. This was one of a range of key industrial policy initiatives taken to grow our employment value chain as decades of relative under-funding had left Ireland lacking internationally competitive research and development capability and human capital in areas of strategic national interest. This was deemed to be an impediment to attracting large-scale international R&D-based firms and to building knowledge-based, internationally competitive indigenous firms.Since 2000, SFI, along with significant research investments supported through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Higher Education Authority amongst others, Ireland has developed an internationally recognised and credible research base. Following the Government's approval of the Research Prioritisation report, the next phase of Ireland's research system evolution places the emphasis on areas with the greatest potential for economic return.  Since its establishment SFI has managed a portfolio of award programmes to support scientific and engineering research ranging from early career researchers to large research centres with multiple industry collaborations.  The overriding criteria in determining what investments SFI supports are research excellence allied to relevance to Ireland's enterprise base.Through its various programmes SFI now supports over 500 research groups, comprising approximately 3,000 team members, located across Ireland's higher education institutions.  Many of these research groups have established very significant collaborations with industry and this is strong evidence of the maturing of the SFI investment.To build on this level of engagement with industry and ensure further economic impact for Ireland, SFI recently called for proposals under the newly developed SFI Research Centres programme. The programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes.  Successful SFI Research Centres will have to achieve and maintain at least 30% of their overall centre budget in industry contributions. There is a requirement that 10% of this be a cash contribution. Not only does this ensure that the Exchequer gets best value for its investment, it will ensure that the needs and opportunities of industry are well represented and are reflected in the research programme. SFI, in devising the new Research Centres programme, has placed a greater emphasis on flexibility and responsiveness to industry-related opportunities, and researchers will be in a position to embrace additional targeted projects and extend their outreach with commercial stakeholders.  SFI is currently assessing pre-proposal applications under the new Centres programme. The initial call has demonstrated a clear demand from industry for this focused engagement — over 450 companies are involved in the 35 pre-proposals submitted to SFI.SFI has put in place a balanced portfolio of award programmes that supports excellent research while ensuring that funded research groups are in a position to convert and commercialise this research in collaboration with industry. As part of the enterprise development system in Ireland, SFI will continue to fund top-class research with impact and train people that will play a critical role in attracting, retaining, growing and forming companies in Ireland.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	On March 1st 2012 the Government published the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, which is now Government policy and a key pillar of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs.As a consequence of the prioritisation process the changes to Science Foundation Ireland's (SFI) pre-selection procedure have only been recently introduced and therefore we should be cautious in making conclusions at this early stage.  The objective of the change is to further increase the quality and diversity as well as the impact of the research supported by SFI.SFI has responded very quickly in using impact and the alignment of the Government's new research priority areas to help assess its major research funding decisions in the months ahead.In February 2012 SFI issued a call for proposals under the new SFI Research Centres Programme. This centres based programme builds upon the success of the SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (CSET) and Strategic Research Clusters (SRC) programmes, while taking on board all that SFI has learned in the past 12 years since establishment.The new programme will address the needs of industry by ensuring that, up-front, the research programmes of each Research Centre will be aligned with one or more of the prioritisation areas identified by the Research Prioritisation Steering Group.  In addition to the rigorous scientific evaluation for which SFI is already very well regarded, proposals received by SFI under the 2012 call will receive a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the potential impact that the Research Centre may deliver to the industry sector, as well as the Irish economy as a whole.As part of the Research Centres Programme call process, SFI has used an impact panel of leading investors in science, leaders of industry and internationally competitive research centres to help it assess the strategic value of the research projects it is considering at the pre-proposal state.  Overall, having some assessment based on impact and commercialisation criteria can provide a very useful mechanism, but only when made in the context of research excellence. This will ensure that the SFI Research Centres that are established have demonstrated their relevance and potential to contribute to the success of industry based in Ireland. In undertaking this strategic pre-proposal review SFI was mindful to ensure that research with less obvious or immediate impact is not ignored.  These changes will build on SFI's established and well regarded independent international review process.It is anticipated that the actual awards arising from the 2012 Research Centres Programme call process will be announced early in Quarter 1, 2013.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Minister Bruton announced the establishment of Enterprise Ireland's Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund in January 2012.The Fund was outlined in theSouth-East Employment Action Plan   which was published in late 2011.  Companies in the ICT, industrial and food sectors based in the South East were eligible to apply.The purpose of the Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund for the South East Region is to accelerate the growth of start-up companies that have the capability to succeed in global markets.  The fund is designed to assist a new start-up company or individual entrepreneur to investigate the viability of a new growth orientated business or proposition.The Pilot Competitive Feasibility Fund for the South East Region managed by Enterprise Ireland established a fund of €200,000 with each successful applicant receiving a maximum grant of €25,000 to cover 50% of eligible expenditure.By the end of the close date, 45 applications were received. Applications were then assessed on the basis of eligibility and on the merits of the project.  14 were approved for funding support under the Pilot Fund.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The recently announced New Frontiers Programme replaces the Enterprise Platform Programme and aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's recently announced Action Plan for Jobs.The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6-8 week introductory course. The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres.Eight Institutes of Technology (IoTs) have partnered to form four collaborative programmes to deliver the New Frontiers Programme while individual programmes are also being offered from a number of IoTs as follows:Collaborative ProgrammesIndividual ProgrammesIT Carlow/Waterford ITDublin ITLimerick IT/IT TraleeDundalk IT (partnered with CIT)IT Tallaght/IT BlanchardstownCork IT (partnered with DkIT)IT Sligo/Letterkenny ITGalway-Mayo IT (partnered with AIT)Athlone IT (partnered with GMIT)
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The use of technology and innovation has a crucial role to play in supporting economic recovery and in driving sustainable employment in the current environment. Enterprise Ireland in particular, employs a range of supports to encourage and facilitate Irish companies to adapt to, purchase and use new technologies.  Amongst these supports are:E-Business Initiative — under which companies are supported in making effective use of computer-based services including internet, customer relationship management, finance and general business administration.  Since 2005, almost 400 such supports have been offered.Over 250 projects have been initiated under the Lean Start or Lean Plus programmes which provide companies with the Lean tools and techniques to help companies to address competitiveness issues within their businesses by building their capability to identify problems and improve operations.A range of grant schemes have been offered particularly to support capital equipment investment for improved productivity, competitiveness and growth, including:  Productivity Improvement Fund;  Job Expansion Fund; Growth Fund; Company Expansions; Dairy Process Investment Initiative; Beef and Sheepmeat Fund; Scaling including R&D; HPSU Package.In addition, Enterprise Ireland leverages private sector investment in companies through its various Seed and Venture Capital supports which provide valuable investment capital to companies requiring major capital for growth.The competitive advantage created by the use of technology and innovation will be a key driver in achieving Irish economic recovery. Companies that undertake Research and Development and capitalise on innovation have shown a level of growth in trade and exports during recent years that demonstrates the value of technology, high calibre research and innovation activity. A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies —Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland  and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and cost efficiency and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.Among the numerous measures that have been taken to help companies to achieve internationally high levels of innovation are:R&D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.Technology Centres have been established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology, bioenergy, IT Innovation, manufacturing technology, energy efficiency and food.  These centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research. The intention is to establish 16 centres in total by 2013.The Innovation Voucher Scheme is facilitating and encouraging enterprises, particularly small enterprises, to engage in research or development by availing of the services available in research institutions. 453 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2011. The total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened in 2007 is over 1,800.In 2011, 52 companies were given support under the Innovation Partnership programme   which provided funding of €9.9m to Higher Education Institutes to collaborate with companies.The recently announced New Frontiers Programme   aims to raise the number of business start-ups and to increase the pipeline of HPSUs and other sustainable businesses. This new programme forms part of one of the action points set out in the Government's recently announced Action Plan for Jobs. The programme is currently being phased in across the country. Ten institutes have commenced/completed Phase 1 of the Programme with over 300 participants taking part in this 6 — 8 week introductory course.  The first interviews for Phase 2 began in mid-May and four institutes have completed the recruitment process with 48 places offered on the 6 month courses taking place in their incubation centres.Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years largely through the SFI Centres for Science Engineering Technology (CSETs), Strategic Research Clusters (SRCs) and the Principal Investigator (PI) teams. At present SFI is supporting 28 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 19 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are involved in 1,305 industry collaborations with 583 distinct industry partners, both multinational and indigenous.Both in 2010 and 2011, IDA investments of over €500m and €700m respectively were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multinational sector.The initiatives being delivered by the enterprise agencies are supporting enterprise and are ultimately geared towards driving growth, sustainability, exports and job creation. Our objective is to continue to use research and innovation to build competitive advantage and to build on the strengths that have emerged from the investment to date in Science Technology and Innovation.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development (FP7), with a budget of €55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe. FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals, and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.  The Framework Programme enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research. This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks, access to specialist equipment, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.The total funding secured by companies based in Ireland since the commencement of the Seventh Framework Programme in 2007 to November 2011, the latest figures available, is €87.8 million. The figure for 2011 was €25 million and the corresponding target for 2012 is €30 million.  Of the €87.8 million secured by companies based in Ireland, €66.4 million went to SMEs and €21.4 million went to multinationals based in Ireland.The European Commission, in its Fourth Monitoring Report on FP7, covering the years 2007 to 2010 and published in August 2011, states that, in one of the main funding programmes within FP7, Ireland has the highest participation rate of SMEs of the EU 27. This is the rate of SME participation in FP7 compared to the population of SME's in the country.  EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) which runs from 2007 to 2013, and which has a budget of €3.6 billion.  Unlike FP7, funding under the CIP does not go directly to companies; almost 50% of the funding is via European Investment Fund (EIF) Guarantees which are provided to financial intermediaries, and the remainder is used to fund actions such as best practice exchanges and provision of information networks through the Enterprise Europe Network.
