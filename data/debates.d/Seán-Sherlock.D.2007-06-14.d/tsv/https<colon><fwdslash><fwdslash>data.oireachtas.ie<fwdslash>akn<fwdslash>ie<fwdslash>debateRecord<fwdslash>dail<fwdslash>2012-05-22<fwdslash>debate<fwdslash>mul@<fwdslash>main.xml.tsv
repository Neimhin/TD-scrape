SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Sinn Féin does faux indignation very well.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Deputy should come out with him.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We were much more organised, Micheál.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Deputy is not listening to the answer.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Can I clarify?  I am reading a response that is pertinent to the issue Deputy Flanagan is raising.  It is in order to assist with the reply.  I say that sincerely.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is unavoidably detained elsewhere.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important matter.  The Deputy refers to an announcement last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013-14 academic year.  A considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, on the grounds of equity and fairness.  The introduction of such a test would create a more equitable basis for means testing where a more complete analysis is undertaken of a family's capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.  The Deputy will appreciate, in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those who need them most and this has become a high priority.  While the introduction of a capital asset test for student grants may have traditionally been perceived as likely to impact in particular on farming communities, I assure the Deputy this is not the object of the proposal.  The means test will be applied fairly to all applicants.Deputy Flanagan may be aware that a dedicated capital asset test implementation group has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals for new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants beginning in the 2013-14 academic year.  The group has met on three occasions and its deliberations are ongoing.  I anticipate the group will report to the Minister by the summer and will make recommendations on the inclusion or exclusion of various classes of assets.  Any proposals will require further Government agreement and will necessitate legislative amendment.  It will, therefore, be agreed at Cabinet level.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The short reply is that any decision of this nature is ultimately a political decision to be decided by Government.  We must await the recommendations of the implementation group and have consideration to those recommendations.  However, it is ultimately a political decision.I share the concerns raised by Deputy Flanagan in that I, too, represent a constituency with a significant agricultural output and where for a certain coterie of the farming community, income would be meagre, to be frank about it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	There has to be some regard to the tools of the trade, as it were, that are necessary to derive that income.  The Minister has met with ICMSA representatives and he has had regard to the position espoused by them and the implementation group is working as we speak and we await its recommendations.  However, it will be ultimately a decision for Government.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the very serious issue of bullying.  Tackling the issue of bullying, and in particular homophobic bullying in schools, is a key commitment in the programme for Government.  Bullying can ruin a young person's enjoyment of some of the most important years of his or her life and in some cases can have tragic consequences.Deputy Neville summed it up when he spoke about the pervasive nature of this form of bullying.  It can act as a barrier to a young person having equal access to education.  I note that Deputy Neville referred to the document drafted by GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network.  I am to meet with that organisation's chair, Mr. Kieran Rose, shortly so that we can drive an agenda that speaks to the concerns raised by Deputy Neville.Research has shown that, unfortunately, homophobic bullying is a problem in Irish schools, and a correlation has been found between homophobic bullying and serious mental health difficulties such as suicide.  That is one of the reasons the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, convened an anti-bullying forum recently, on 17 May, to explore ways to tackle the serious problem of bullying in schools.  That date, 17 May, marked the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia.The forum, which was well attended and thought-provoking, considered issues around all forms of bullying including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying.  There were a range of speakers at the forum, which included contributions from officials of the Department of Education and Skills, and from an acknowledged academic in the field of anti-bullying.  There were also contributors from the school sector, including the various perspectives of school principals, parents and pupils.  The objective was to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools.  A further objective was to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this, having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.The outcome of the discussions at the forum will provide an opportunity to set out a roadmap on how best to tackle all forms of bullying in our schools.  A considerable amount of work to address the issue of bullying in schools has been done by State agencies and NGOs, such as GLEN and BeLonG To.  We need to address how we can deepen the impact of the measures that are already in place and also strengthen the culture of awareness in schools.  The work of the forum and any recommendations from it must be cognisant of the current difficult and challenging budgetary environment.The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has also established a working group on tackling bullying.  The outcomes, recommendations and submissions from the forum will assist the working group in its deliberations.  The first phase to be addressed by the working group will be homophobic bullying.  There will be an opportunity for all interested stakeholders to submit their views in writing.  Students, teachers, parents and all other interested parties are invited to submit their views on this important topic by 29 June 2012.Deputy Neville has taken a strong lead on this issue.  If we continue to engage in fora such as this one, we will be able to shed more light on the issue, thus having the required beneficial outcomes.  We all believe that bullying is an issue we can address by sharing our experiences and working together to produce an effective response.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputy for his input.  It is important to acknowledge the work that is already being done by the Department of Education and Skills to combat and prevent bullying.  The inspectorate provides help to schools by supporting, advising on and evaluating anti-bullying measures.  This is done through the primary and post-primary school evaluation process, and through the social, personal and health education subject inspections.  There are therefore a wide range of services in that area.I note Deputy Neville's point about some schools being willing to engage in anti-bullying programmes while others are less so.  If there is a submission to that effect coming through this process, the Department of Education and Skills should take it on board in order to have a qualitative outcome to this issue.  Ultimately, the more educated we all are as citizens about this matter, the more it will be clarified and demystified.  The more normalised our culture becomes around this issue, the less pervasive it will be.  If we can change a culture we can then modify behaviour positively.  I note Deputy Neville's points and I hope there will be some mechanism to address the lack of engagement by some schools on this matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  Local authorities have traditionally been the lenders of last resort for low income households who could not access funds from commercial lenders.  By definition, this cohort of borrowers is more susceptible to the economic downturn and external shock.  In this context, it is unsurprising then that local authority mortgage arrears should exceed those in the commercial sector and the Department's most recent information puts the level of loans in arrears at almost 28%.In 2009, the Department issued guidelines for the granting of local authority housing loans which applied stringent conditions and a more homogenous process across all 34 administrations.  Credit checking of applications by the Irish Credit Bureau was a central component of this initiative, and loans advanced under the new regime are performing considerably better than pre-2009 ones.However, it is important that households facing difficulties are treated fairly and consistently across all local authority areas.  In that regard, the Department issued comprehensive guidance in 2010 based on the regulator's code of practice.  This is to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.Recognising the increasing difficulty with local authority mortgage arrears, the Department has been working in conjunction with the City and County Managers Association to produce a loans management manual, the publication of which is imminent.  This will provide borrowers in distress with a suite of options under a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, to deal with their loans.  It closely mirrors the Financial Regulator's revised code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which came into effect on 1 January 2011.  It provides for a collaborative engagement between borrower and lender to either restructure the loan to a sustainable level, or else recognise its sustainability and act accordingly.Whereas it would be hoped that as many home owners as possible could be facilitated under the MARP, it would be unrealistic not to accept the inevitability of a proportion of loans being deemed unsustainable.  In these circumstances the local authorities and the borrower would need to face the inevitability of the loan being unsustainable and act accordingly in a collaborative and co-operative manner.Local authorities will continue to deal with distressed borrowers with the same forbearance and sympathy they have exhibited in the past.  They will facilitate where at all possible as many home owners as possible to retain their properties and service their debts until such time as we return to less challenging times.I do not have a date in respect of the question the Deputy asked but respectfully suggest that if he were to table a parliamentary question or send me on note on it, I would be happy to try to oblige him.  We do not have a definitive timeline for the publication of the guidelines but I will endeavour to come back to the Deputy on that.The Deputy referred to 106 homes in the case of County Offaly.  I am not sure if that is the rate of arrears, to what exact figure that would amount, or what it would be as a percentage of the loan book in the Offaly area.  If there are issues pertaining to his specific area, I have an open mind in terms of engagement or at least I can refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Having been a member of a local authority and as somebody who continues to interface with a local authority on behalf of my constituents, it is fair to reiterate that the level of sympathy and empathy with individual clients is one kind of a positive engagement where the local authority endeavours to do its very best for the client in question.  I believe we would all agree on that point.  However, there is an inevitability that a certain number of mortgages will go under.On the specific issues the Deputy raised, it is not fair to assume that because there is a lack of a timescale for the publication the Deputy would infer that it will not be before the summer recess.  I can come back to him on the specific matters raised and refer them to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.I will undertake to also refer the Deputy's question on the shared ownership scheme to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I am not trying to dodge the issues, I simply do not have the specific replies to the Deputy's questions and I would rather not try to play a game of bluff.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I am happy to conclude the discussion on Second Stage of the Credit Guarantee Bill 2012.  This legislation will address some of the difficulties being faced every day by small and medium enterprises, SMEs, throughout the country, which I have been made aware of daily since being appointed Minister of State last year.  The ability of our SMEs to succeed and grow underpins our future potential for employment, growth and prosperity, and this Bill shows our commitment to implement change and reform in a step by step approach, to re-energise the economy, meet the challenges of recovery, address a failed economic model, restore confidence and to enhance Ireland's position in the world.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I wish to respond to some of the comments made by Members.  In the context of the finer details of how the scheme will operate, the Minister will lay the scheme before the House as soon as this legislation is enacted.  This provision is provided for in section 6 of the Bill.  As for the use of personal guarantees, the banks still will be able to consider the normal and usual ways that security is provided by borrowers.  Invoice discounting will be eligible for the guarantee scheme.  The guarantee will be for three years but the loan may be for a longer term.  The legislation provides for the premium payment to be paid upfront.  However, this matter of the timing of the payment is being reconsidered and amendments may be tabled on Committee Stage.  The scheme will be demand-led and the Government will follow performance and take-up closely.  If figures show that demand exceeds €150 million, this figure can be revisited and amended, if necessary.Regarding loans that are defaulted, the banks will follow their normal recoveries procedures.  This matter of recoveries will be covered in the scheme.  As for the issue of late payment of invoices causing difficulties to small businesses, the Department will transpose the new EU directive on late payments before 16 March 2013.  With regard to ensuring additionality of lending under the guarantee scheme, the Department is in talks with the banks at present to ensure they fully understand their obligations.  The loans provided under the scheme will be closely monitored to ensure they fall within the two market failures the scheme is designed to address.  In respect of the risk-sharing ratio, this is a joint commitment by the Government and the banks.  The combination of guarantee rate and default limit will deliver an overall risk share of 50:50.  Losses over the default rate must be borne by the banks.In the context of the microfinance fund, it will avail of the EU progress guarantee facility as soon as the lending entity is established.  I also point out that First Step, which lends to micro-enterprise, already avails of this EU guarantee facility.  Any further issues to which I have not responded will be addressed on Committee Stage.As my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, noted in his opening comments on commending the Bill to the House, The Government's Action Plan for Jobs 2012 prioritises where it will place its efforts to best effect over the coming months.  It adds up to a co-ordinated plan of vigorous and targeted action in order that the Government achieves change and makes a difference.  Businesses need action from the Government, not words.  This legislation is clear evidence of concrete action that will produce tangible benefits for the businesses that avail of the guarantee scheme.  The Bill will help restore confidence, which is an integral part of economic health.  It also forms an essential part of our recovery.  Businesses must develop sufficient confidence in the future to begin expanding their order books and payrolls.  Banks must be willing and able to lend sufficiently to meet the needs of business again.  Consumers must regain the confidence to spend again.The Government's overall strategy is aimed at making sure citizens and businesses feel confident it has their interests at heart and is implementing necessary change.  The strategy is to ensure they have an outlet for entrepreneurial initiative and marketable ideas and the chance to turn them into commercial products.  Making sure they can confidently go into business and create jobs is an essential element of the Government programme and making sure that Ireland is strongly perceived as a good place to do business is essential in generating such confidence.  The Government has committed to making Ireland, to quote the Taoiseach, "the best small country in the world in which to do business" by 2016 and it can achieve that target.  The Government has a legitimate and important role in improving the finance environment for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Carefully designed legislative interventions, such as this measure, can help markets function better, give certainty to business and confidence to consumers.  I believe this legislation will inspire confidence among SMEs in the banks' abilities to provide an improved service to SME customers, including previously discouraged borrowers.  It has been frequently acknowledged in the recent past that there will be a cohort of discouraged borrowers who assumed they would be turned down and therefore did not apply for credit.  The introduction of a guarantee scheme may help to support this group to pursue business opportunities again.The majority of Ireland's enterprise sector comprises small businesses.  Now more than ever, ambitious and energetic business owners, entrepreneurs and managers who can play a real part in driving a positive uplift in the economy are needed.  They are the job creators and innovators and must be encouraged and supported to have the confidence to make their mark and build a better future for themselves and this country.  These are the all too often unseen risk takers and innovators and it always will be the hard-work and entrepreneurial skills of such individuals that will lie at the heart of the success of Ireland's SMEs.  All these companies have financing needs through the various stages of business development such as start up, managing working capital, investing in new products or services, marketing strategies, innovation and research and development, expanding output and entering new markets.  It is essential that the financial system supports the needs of SMEs through all these stages.Many businesses have contacted the Department about the problems caused by their difficulties in accessing credit.  All Members, as public representatives, are aware of the difficulties that face people within their constituencies and nationwide.  Increased risk aversion among banks has made it significantly harder for smaller companies to obtain finance in recent years compared with the period before the crisis.  Herein lies the mismatch between the needs of productive business and the bank finance available.  While banks are trying to reduce risk, business lending, especially to SMEs, is risky.  Entrepreneurship is risky.  Introducing new products and services is risky.  Exporting to emerging markets is risky.  Innovation is risky.  This Bill will enable the Government to absorb some of the risk of lending in order that businesses can get on with what they do best.  We must dismantle unnecessary barriers that stymie growth and hold back investment.  That is exactly what this Government is determined to do and this Bill moves us in that direction.I personally have met various companies that are at the margins of SME commercial lending decisions because the businesses have insufficient security or the lender does not have the skills to carry out an appropriate assessment of the business proposition.  It is essential to address this issue in a way that will not reduce the onus on banks to honour their commitments to increase SME lending overall but which would facilitate additional lending over and above those commitments.In conclusion, this Bill is important legislation.  It will assist in the Government's plans to reshape the finance landscape to render it more effective in meeting the needs of Irish businesses.  The Government is taking decisive action to create the environment that supports new companies, new jobs and new economic opportunities.  I refer to action that keeps open the doors of Irish businesses, supports existing business to scale up and expand and facilitates more people who have the ambition and drive to set up their own business.  This Bill is just one of the many steps for delivery of such a challenging agenda.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(a) and (6)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.
