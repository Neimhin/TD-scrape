SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for raising this issue.  As the Deputy is aware 10,575 special needs assistant posts are available for allocation to schools for the 2012-13 school year.  This is the same number of posts available for allocation in the current school year.  Therefore, there has been no reduction in the overall number of SNA posts available for allocation in the coming school year.  The Government has maintained funding for special education and for SNA support at a time when there has been a requirement to make expenditure savings in range of areas.  With equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources it is considered that there will be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care and support to attend school in accordance with departmental criteria.Through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, the National Council for Special Education is responsible for allocating special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support and this includes a requirement for it to have regard to the overall cap on numbers.  In the context of the overall limit on the number of SNA posts available, it is necessary for the NCSE to prioritise applications and to distribute SNA resources equitably and efficiently throughout all schools.  One of the priority criteria applied in the allocation of SNA posts is to ensure that the minimum SNA to special class ratio is maintained in special schools and special classes.In the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, a special school for children with autism, I understand it has an enrolment of 24 pupils at present with staffing of one principal and five mainstream class teachers as well as 16 SNAs.  This is a total of 22 staff catering for the needs of 24 pupils and equates to an SNA to pupil ratio of 1:1.5 and an overall adult to pupil ratio of 1:1.1.  This is an exceptionally high level of support and is considerably in excess of the current recommended SNA ratio for special class groups, including children with autism spectrum disorder, as outlined in the Department of Education and Skills circular 0038/10, that is to say, a ratio of two SNAs per special class group of six children.The NCSE has advised all schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending each school.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for SNA support for the 2012-13 school year by 16 March 2012.  They will be advised of their allocation for the 2012-13 school year by late May or early June 2012 based on the number of valid applications received by 16 March.  Therefore, no final SNA allocation for 2012-13 has been made for this school yet.  Whereas the NCSE has indicated to the school that based on its current pupil numbers it has four surplus SNA posts, until any applications for potential new entrants for the 2012-13 school year are considered no final determination will be made.  I understand the NCSE is due to meet representatives of the school shortly to discuss staffing requirements for the coming school year.  The NCSE will advise the school by late May or early June of its SNA allocation for the 2012-13 school year.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thoroughly respect the fact that the Deputy must advocate for the school in his constituency and I do not doubt the veracity of the case made by him in respect of the school and the good work it carries out.  However, the Deputy has admitted an overall cap is in place.  A process is under way in respect of SNA allocation and we should have regard to this fact.  The Deputy's claim that this a callous decision must be tackled in the sense that the overall budget within the Department of Education and Skills has been reduced and we must ask ourselves why we have come to this stage.  I take the point made by the Deputy but given that it is a special junior primary school I am hopeful that the National Council for Special Education will have regard to this fact and a process is under way.The allocation of SNAs to schools changes over time and we should acknowledge this.  Children may have diminishing care needs over time.  Some children leave school at the end of each school year and the pupil population of a school may change over time.  It is important to note that the SNA allocation process for the 2012-13 school year is still under way.  Schools have been advised to make applications by 16 March and they will be advised of their SNA allocation by late May.  The case is well made by the Deputy and I hope the NCSE will have regard to this during its deliberations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank Deputy Dowds for raising this matter and for the opportunity to respond.Stobart Ireland is part of the Stobart Group which, I understand, operates from over 40 sites across the UK and Europe.  Stobart Ireland began operating in 2008 winning the transport services contract with Tesco in 2010 to distribute all of the products it keeps at depots at Ballymun and Donabate in Dublin.  On 15 February last, SIPTU announced that following a ballot of its members, Stobart drivers had voted to strike over concerns about their working conditions and served notice of industrial action.  Stobart Ireland drivers subsequently carried out a 36-hour work stoppage on Thursday and Friday, 23 and 24 February.  I understand that a picket by drivers was held at the company's main Irish depot in Ballymun, Dublin on Thursday from 6.00 p.m. until 11.30 p.m.Rest time, rosters and general working conditions have been identified by SIPTU as the factors that led to the decision to strike.  SIPTU maintains that these grievances had been put before the company for some time but the company failed to address the issues.  It appears that Stobart Ireland responded to the threat of industrial action by taking the unusual step of initiating its own ballot of drivers.  The company claimed that its ballot showed that only a minority backed industrial action.  It claimed that the outcome demonstrated a lack of support for the planned strike and called on the union to cease its industrial action.  SIPTU described the company ballot as a coercive tactic and denied that the outcome of the company ballot could be deemed to articulate the clear voice of the majority of workers in the driver category.I understand that Stobart Ireland had initially welcomed the suggestion to attend the Labour Relations Commission on the eve of the industrial action.  The company requested that the threat of strike action be lifted as a condition of its willingness to engage with the industrial relations dispute services.  However, as the industrial action proceeded as planned, the company declined to engage in conciliation talks.  According to reports, the company had flown in 40 agency drivers from the UK to replace the striking workers.  SIPTU has claimed that the drivers flown in were not informed of the background to the dispute in Dublin before they arrived.  It appears that the company did not proceed, however, to deploy the replacement drivers.I understand that the Labour Relations Commission is maintaining contact with both parties to the dispute and will continue to remain available to assist in trying to resolve the issues in dispute.  I would urge the parties to agree to avail of the services of the State's industrial relations machinery and to engage fully in the process.  I urge them to put their difficulties and differences behind them and approach the process in good faith and with a view to accepting the outcome of the process.Ireland's system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers, whether in redundancy or other collective disputes, rests with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery to support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences.  The Labour Relations Commission has extensive experience in assisting parties to resolve issues of rest time, rosters and other general working conditions and in achieving a high rate of mutually acceptable settlements on such issues.  Even what often appears to be the most intractable of disputes is capable of resolution where both sides engage constructively and in good faith in this voluntary process.  I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice.Stobart Ireland is an extremely big company with a large footprint across Ireland.  I am aware of it from personal experience on the roads between Cork and Dublin where I have noticed an exceptionally high presence of Stobart trucks.  I contend that we have a highly evolved labour relations infrastructure in this country and we would ask companies to engage in corporate social responsibility and come a bit of the road towards meeting needs that will ensure drivers can operate safely.  We would urge all companies that win contracts in Ireland to engage constructively with the State machinery set up for dispute resolution.  If we can achieve that, I am hopeful some compromise can be hammered out through the labour relations machinery that exists in this country.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I take the Deputy's point.  In response, I contend that the legitimacy of the Labour Relations Commission, which has opened its doors to facilitate a process, is one the State, Irish workers and most employers buy into.  That is the right way to proceed on this issue.  I hope the Stobart organisation will have due regard to that process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Deputy Dowds is more schooled on that.  There is legislation to protect every worker's rights and in respect of dispute resolution.  It is voluntary by nature, but we must be fair and balanced in how we approach the issue and I would hope any reasonable company, or any entity, would use the voluntary mechanism that is available.  That is the way to proceed.  If that fails, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	As the Deputy is aware it is prohibited under existing legislation within the State to illegally hack into the wireless internet of a third party.  It is a matter for the Garda Síochána to investigate and prosecute any such illegal activity involving the illegal hacking into a third parties' wireless internet.Access to the internet is normally the subject of a contract between an individual (or entity) and an Internet Service Provider.  Any issues arising between the parties regarding this access should in the first instance be dealt with in the normal course of their business agreement.
