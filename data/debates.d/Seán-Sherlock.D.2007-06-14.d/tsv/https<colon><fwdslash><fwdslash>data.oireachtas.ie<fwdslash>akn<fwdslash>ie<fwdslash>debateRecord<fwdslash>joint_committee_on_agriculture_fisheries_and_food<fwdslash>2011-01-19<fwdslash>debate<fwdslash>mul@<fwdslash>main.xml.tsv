SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate that Mr. Coveney agreed to appear before the committee at the last minute, given that we were supposed to be engaging with Mr. Odlum.  I am glad the head of Greencore was able to attend.  Mr. Coveney's submission does not pull any punches but it would be worthwhile to investigate further the historical perspective.  I do not want to dwell on these matters too long because we are most interested in the future viability of the industry and where we can go as a country in regard to ethanol or sugar production.  It is important to hear Greencore's opinion on these matters.From a political point of view, the historical perspective suggests that Greencore's version of events is at variance with that of the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr. Moran, who stated in his submission:the decision to close the Mallow factory and thus to cease sugar production, was made by Greencore and Greencore alone.  The Government and the Department did not have any power to prevent this.He went on to state that the renunciation of the quota was in the hands of Greencore and was a commercial decision in which the Government did not play a role.Mr. Coveney stated: "In the early days of these discussions...[r]ecognising that some significant changes were inevitable, Greencore lobbied hard at EU and Government level for Ireland to retain a reduced but significant quota in a regime reformed through quota cuts."  This suggests the decision was political rather than corporate.  I seek clarity on this matter.  Mr. Coveney also referred to Mr. McConnell's report in The Irish Times that growers were split down the middle on whether to seek an increase in the base price or opt for a complete shut-down, stating:The IFA chose the latter course of action on behalf of its members.  It was not an irrational response, given the compensation potentially on offer to growers and the practical difficulties.This is confusing because he went on to state: "No growers had committed to supply Mallow by the beginning of March 2006 for the autumn 2006 campaign."  Is that factually the case?  There is a school of thought which believes a number of growers in the Mallow and north County Cork area would have been more than willing to engage the company if it had not demolished its plant.  They intended to grow for a further 12 months and then decide how the market was performing.  I ask for clarity because it appears there is disparity between the Government's position as set out by Mr. Moran and what Greencore has argued today.Mr. Coveney also stated that the Department exercised its discretion under the new regime to base the allocation of compensation to growers on the 2003-04 reference period without consulting Greencore.  What was the nature of the contacts between Greencore and the Department or the Minister of the day?  It has been suggested the decision to change the regime was made by the Council of Ministers and that the interaction with Greencore was subsequent to that fateful night in November.I have before me a master plan for Mallow west which was submitted for consideration under the 2006 local area plan.  I was the mayor of Mallow in 2004 and 2005, during which time the issue of the site's future arose.  We hesitated to support the submission because the factory's workers had not yet received their due entitlements from the compensation package.  In spite of what Mr. Coveney has claimed, the perception of Greencore was very negative among growers, workers and the wider community because we did not believe it had a sense of corporate social responsibility to the generations of workers and growers who kept the factory going.  There was a sense that Greencore and the sweeping hand of capitalism was going to make as much as it could from the site.  We only agreed to the Mallow west proposals in the county development plan on the basis that the workers were compensated properly.  The plan stated the Mallow west project would involve a capital investment of €500 million and create a consumer spend of €22.7 million per annum, a total of 2,000 jobs and a critical mass so that Mallow could capitalise on its designation as a hub town under the national spatial strategy.  None of that has happened.As members will imagine, the perception of Greencore in Mallow is very negative at this stage.  Now that a realistic proposal has emerged from the Irish bio-fuels initiative to get something going on some site in Ireland, Mr. Coveney appears to suggest it will not be possible to produce sugar without subsidies.  At the same time, he stated that Greencore will not be involved in sugar or ethanol production in the future but is available for assistance.  What is Greencore's plan for the site?  Some of it was rezoned at our behest for light industrial use.  Will the company engage with stakeholders, such as the Irish bio-fuels initiative, to contribute to a viability study in line with the Department's offer of support and, if so, how will it go about it?  I suggest Greencore has corporate social responsibility in this matter.  It has done quite well out of the process but there is a perception that it has given nothing back to Mallow.  Perhaps one way of redressing that imbalance would be for it to engage with people or parties who want to develop that site for industrial or commercial purposes.I hope these issues can be addressed.  I have further questions which I will ask on the second round of questioning if I am permitted.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It was Mallow west.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To what does Mr. Coveney attribute that, if I may ask?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I seek clarification because it is important for the people of north Cork.  If we can reach a stage where Greencore is meaningfully engaging with the Mallow Development Partnership or stakeholders such as the Irish Biofuels Initiative, then we have a starting point.  If such a guarantee could be garnered today with regard to the Mallow site or other potential uses for the site from a commercial or industrial point of view through the Mallow Development Partnership and the Irish Biofuels Initiative, it would represent a positive that we could take from today.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to the special share.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me back in.  On Thursday, 11 November 2010, there were statements in the Dáil on the EU sugar regime.  On that occasion the Minister said:...the special share in Greencore did not allow the Minister, acting on behalf of the State, to contribute to the decision made by Greencore on the renunciation of the quota.  The proposed actions by Greencore that required the Minister's consent under the terms associated with the special share were related to any changes to certain specified articles of the articles of association; the voluntary winding up of Greencore; the sale of more than 49% of Irish Sugar plc, a subsidiary of Greencore; and the creation of a new class of shares in Greencore.  Legal advice obtained at the time was that they did not include provision for the Minister to direct Greencore in relation to the sugar quota.  Greencore was the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota.My interpretation of that statement is that the renunciation of the share, according to the Minister, rests firmly and squarely at the door of Greencore, by virtue of the legislation, and, therefore, the Minister is arguably washing his hands of any decision, saying it was a corporate decision as opposed to a political decision.  Where do we go from here?  What is the future?  I would like to hear Mr. Coveney's opinion on this particular tract of the speech?  What is the future?  Greencore has clearly stated here that it has no intention of getting involved in sugar or ethanol production.  That is clear and we can put that issue to bed.  I would like to get a further sense of how Greencore will engage with the stakeholders.  I am aware that he said earlier he would not go into the detail of that but if he can reaffirm that commitment we will take something positive from this meeting.I welcome the fact that some of the statements made in regard to sugar production in Ireland by Mr. Coveney may be rebutted at a future meeting of committee by the Irish Biofuels Initiative and possibly by Mr. McCarthy and company.  I am glad from my party's point of view that we have had this consultation because it has clarified certain matters for which I thank Mr. Coveney.
