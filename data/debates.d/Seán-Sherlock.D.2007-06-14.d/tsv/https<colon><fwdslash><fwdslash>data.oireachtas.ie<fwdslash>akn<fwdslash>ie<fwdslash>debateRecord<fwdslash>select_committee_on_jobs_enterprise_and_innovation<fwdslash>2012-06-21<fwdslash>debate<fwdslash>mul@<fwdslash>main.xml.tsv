[<p eid="para_15">To continue the canine theme, perhaps we would not be in the situation we are in now if we had put a few more dogs in the manger.</p>, <p eid="para_16">I agree with the points that have been made by Deputies Lawlor and O'Dea.  It is imperative to ensure the concerns they have espoused are taken on board when regulations come to the fore on foot of the European Commission's auditing proposals that are before us at present.  The bottom line is that it is sensible to provide for a strong and robust auditing regime that is regulated by way of legislation.  If it can be done at EU level, that is the way to go.  I anticipate that this matter will be considered during the Irish Presidency.  It is vital for us to ensure that concerns of this nature are articulated and can work their way into the final legislative outcome.  There is no question about the fact that we take this issue seriously.</p>, <p eid="para_17">As public representatives, we all have experience of dealing with community groups.  I am familiar with the credit union movement, which has been audited by particular firms and had to go back to those firms again following changes in the regulatory regime at Central Bank level.  Credit unions have had to pay considerable sums to those companies.  Certain issues arise in that regard.  There is no doubt that the voluntary pillar, including the various community groups, is completely and utterly robust in how it conducts its business.  The groups in question often have to pay for audit reports on two or three occasions to demonstrate that.  That aspect of the system has to be examined and cleaned up.  I take the points the Deputies have made.  There is no question about the need for a robust auditing regime.</p>, <p eid="para_18">Deputy O'Dea mentioned that he and others have received a submission from the Professional Insurance Brokers Association.  I understand that Deputy Lawlor has contacted the office of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to highlight the issue.  I anticipate that a significant response will be given on Report Stage and the matter will be dealt with.  If amendments are proposed, or if further discussion can be facilitated, we will be very open to that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_20">I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who is out of the country at present.  He has asked me to convey his gratitude to the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.</p>]
