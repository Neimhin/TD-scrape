SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	My questions relate to the sugar industry.  I hail from the town of Mallow.  When the court's report was issued, it was met with utter devastation, disgust and complete surprise, even in view of what other Members have stated here today.  The report, which is comprehensive, states "the audit found that in one MS [member state] the only producer, which before the sugar reform had undertaken a consolidation/rationalisation of its processing facilities and defined itself as one of Europe's most efficient producers, closed down its large, modern and potentially efficient sugar factory justifying their decision on the risk of the lower prices reducing the supply of sugar beet to an uneconomic level".  I am unsure whether the following quote comes from Mr. O'Shea but as per the RTE news on the day of the publication of the report, a quote attributed to Mr. O'Shea stated that it is possible the Greencore plant would still be operating today if it were not for the sugar reforms introduced by the European Commission.I seek a confirmation of what has been stated already in the report.  Did this so-called reform of the sugar industry meet its targets?  If it did not meet its targets is there a possibility, notwithstanding the fact that we are not to produce sugar in this country until 2017, that it can be revisited in light of the fact that the European Court of Auditor's report clearly states that the regime did not set out to do what it was supposed to do.  The use of the word "reform" is thorny because it is a loaded term as well.  It was not a reform and clearly it did not work.  The growers and the workers who lost their jobs wish to know where now for the report?  What is the import of it?  Will it work its way into the ether?  Are we left with the political entrails of it?  Is there hope that we could glean from the report the potential to rekindle the industry?I to refer to the summary in the report.  Point II states the objectives of the reform were "to ensure the competitiveness of the EU sugar industry".  That has not been achieved because we now have a cartel and 75 factories have closed with 20,000 jobs lost throughout the European Union.  Will the delegation inform the committee how many we are left with?  I believe there are only a handful operating within France, Germany and perhaps others countries.  The French and Germans have now created a cartel in the production of sugar in the European Union.  A layman's view is that if the European Court of Auditor's report is to mean anything there should be a reversal of this trend and peripheral countries such as Ireland should be able to get back into the market not only for sugar production for confectionary or other purposes but also for the production of ethanol to meet our bio-fuel obligations under EU legislation.  I would like to get the opinion of the witnesses on the matter and I apologise if my question is not strictly relevant to the business before us.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Mr. O'Shea stated the purpose of the Court of Auditors is to set down a marker now on what to do or what not to do in the future.  There is a tacit expression in the report that the Commission - I do not want to speak in the vernacular - made a complete hames of this and that we decimated an industry overnight.  We are now being told not to do it again and that this is not the way to do business.  Do not get me wrong; I am not having a go at the witnesses and I understand from where they are coming on this.  However, when global sugar prices are increasing and we can produce the product here it does not seem good enough to tell the citizens of this country that mistakes were made but to drive on and this is what not to do in the future.  It is not good enough.  Particularly for somebody in my party, which is overtly pro-European and outward looking, it feeds into a cynicism as to how the Commission works, particularly on how certain governments can control certain aspects of the regime while professing to be moving into an intra-institutional framework in terms of decision-making.  It is still very much an intergovernmental framework and very much about the interest of the nation states.  This clearly proves that the interests of France and Germany were tied up in ensuring that Irish sugar could no longer exist.  The Court of Auditors is now vindicating this position in its report but there is not a blessed thing we can do about it.  This is not good enough.  I am not trying to shoot the messenger but if the powers of this Parliament have been increased under the Lisbon treaty there must be something we are able to do to change this type of decision-making because it is completely inadequate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Not for ethanol.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is it true that for €20 million less we could have kept the factory open in Mallow?  We got €20 million to raze it to the ground.  If that had been foregone, the factory could have remained standing and we could have moved into ethanol production.  The opinion that the factory was destroyed for the sake of a €20 million compensation package has been doing the rounds locally for some years.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is important.  How did the auditors adjudicate that the information received was incorrect?  Did they do that through their own sources or was that knowledge imparted to them by a third party or another source after the fact?  The policy was implemented and did what it set out to do.The auditors are now saying the information was flawed.  At what point did the auditors adjudicate the information was flawed?  From what source did they get that information?  Did it come from a member state or the Commission?  I presume the Commission was acting on information supplied by the member states.  That is what we are trying to establish.  As far as we are concerned, that is the kernel of the issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are at a crucial stage of this interaction.  Could I ask that Mr. O'Shea is given a chance to respond?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The delegation is basing this on Commission information, data or statistics.  That is a racing certainty.  However, what Commission data was used?  Where did the Commission ascertain its data on growing, numbers and funding?  It had to do this through the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this country, directly from farm sources or other sources.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Or from Greencore.  There must have been an information flow between the agricultural or beet growing sector here and the Commission for the court to adjudicate on the Commission data.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With respect, Mr. O'Shea is kicking to touch on this one.  At issue is transparency in the European Union.  At the outset of the report I took the view Mr. O'Shea was a man who has just authored a report which clearly shows inadequacies in how the regime worked and the court's report is remarkably tacit.  Let us start drilling down.  I note the gentleman beside Mr. O'Shea, who has not made any contribution, whispered something into his ear.  We wish to establish the situation.  From which sources did the court get the-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is supposed to be a transparent process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If one authors a report-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We respect that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, Chairman-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Chairman-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is a committee.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate the Chairman's latitude on this matter.  I am not trying to have a go at Mr. O'Shea or Mr. Weldon.  We are simply trying to ascertain something.  I am not an accountant or an auditor.  However, I assume an auditor receives information from a particular source.  Clearly, it was deemed that the source of information was flawed.  Are we not entitled to ask what the source of information was?  If it was from the Commission, from whom or which entity did the Commission get its information?  Did the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that is to say, the member state parcel together the position on the reform of the sugar regime, or was it from another source?  We are entitled to ask this question because we are asking it on behalf of the growers, the workers who lost their jobs and their families.  That is the bottom line.  Everyone associated with the industry wishes to know on what basis the decision was made.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	No, it was an intergovernmental decision.  It was a Council of Ministers decision.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It was a decision of the member states.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Political considerations override the Commission's considerations.
