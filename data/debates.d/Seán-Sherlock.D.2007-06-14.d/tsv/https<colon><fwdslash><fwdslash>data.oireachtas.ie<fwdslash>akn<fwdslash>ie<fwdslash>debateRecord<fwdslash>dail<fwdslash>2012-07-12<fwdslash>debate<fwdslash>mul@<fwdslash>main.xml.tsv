SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The microenterprise loan fund will facilitate the growth and expansion of all viable microenterprises from all industry sectors across the country that have been refused access to credit from the banks.  It is a key element in our Action Plan for Jobs.  The fund has a significant entrepreneurship focus to encourage all would-be entrepreneurs across the country who may be unemployed but who have the potential to generate employment for themselves and others.  It will not have geographical quotas but will be of particular help to persons who are unemployed who would have much greater difficulty accessing conventional sources of bank lending.  It will be promoted through a range of networks across the country, including local bodies that support business start-up for people with fewer resources, and in areas of high unemployment.  It will not be confined to businesses with export potential and will be more within the reach of unemployed persons who target business opportunities within their own local communities.  It will form an important complementary element and add value to schemes of support, such as the back to work allowance.  Support will be in the form of loans, rather than grants.Loans will be made available to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  It will ultimately be for enterprises to apply for the loans so it will be demand-led in that sense.  It is envisaged that mentoring will be an important element in the success of the fund.  Delivery of business supports including business planning and mentoring to facilitate successful credit applications will be facilitated through the national network of existing bodies and agencies.  The county and city enterprise boards are often the first port of call for business support and advice, and they will be actively involved in the promotion of the microfinance fund across the country.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The scheme is currently being finalised and will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Deputy refers to a unique case.  There is a code of practice in the scheme whereby a decision must be made within two weeks or 15 days - I will have to check the exact timeframe.  The core principle of the microenterprise loan fund is that even in good economic circumstances the risk criteria might not be met by a certain coterie of people, such as the person to whom the Deputy referred.  They might be credit-worthy but they do not fit within the banking criteria.  The fund is designed for people in that position.  Given that the local bodies will then feed into that process, one hopes there will be a fit solution for such people so they will not have to incur massive administrative costs to be able to access the fund so they can start their businesses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	It will be within two years.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am bringing in a series of targeted initiatives to make it easier for micro-enterprises and small and medium enterprises to access credit.  The micro-enterprise loan fund scheme, which is expected to be operational from early autumn, will facilitate up to €40 million in additional lending to micro-enterprises over the next five years.  The Government is in the process of introducing the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme for micro-enterprises and small and medium enterprises which, because of a lack of collateral or the sector in which they operate, face difficulties in accessing traditional bank credit.These initiatives coupled with the recently launched second call under the innovation fund and the development capital scheme will strongly contribute to addressing the credit needs of business and facilitate business modernisation and expansion, in addition to the creation and maintenance of jobs.Furthermore, the Minister recently met the CEOs of the two pillar banks to impress upon them the importance of keeping their lending practices in tune with the changing needs of Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the banks to develop credit propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth - start-ups, early stage and mature companies - and to adopt cash flow lending as opposed to the asset-backed approach that has been the norm in recent years.My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and ensure the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention.My colleague, the Minister of State responsible for small business, Deputy Perry, continues to meet business owners on a regular basis to hear at first hand their views and experiences and to examine further the actions that might be taken to improve access to credit for SMEs.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Deputy referred to ISME's report, but there is also a Mazars report.  The Credit Review Office, CRO, is our benchmark, but should not be viewed as a permanent fixture.  According to a figure in the Mazars report, a demand survey showed that only 36% of SMEs sought credit in the April-September period.  As the domestic economy recovers and SMEs seek to increase working capital, the demand for lending will increase and two factors will point to CRO assistance being required.  The ultimate aim is to drive credit through the system
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The relatively poor capital and liquidity conditions of some SMEs following three years of a flat-lining domestic economy is one of the factors.  Some of the SMEs that bank with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, will seek new credit and will need to be moved to new banks.  If those banks are unwilling or unable to provide that credit when the upturn arrives, it will be another factor.  If the Deputy will bear with me, I am looking for the figures.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The economic management council, EMC, engages with the banks to ensure that they deliver.  The Deputy must acknowledge that they have delivered on their 2011 lending targets.  I am struggling to find the figures on the percentages in terms of credit.  They were to hand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The report compiled by the accounting firm Mazars showed that 67% of completed credit applications were approved by the banks, representing an increase of 2% on the previous year's report, with the rate of refusals falling by a corresponding amount of approximately 28%.  Despite the downturn, the report indicates that some companies are still in a position to protect their finances from potential problems.It is important that we give ISME, the small business community and its other representative organisations their due regard, but it is also important that we be objective in our interpretation of the figures.  If one drills into the figures, one will realise that some of the results in the survey to which the Deputy referred were based on media perceptions of credit.  It is important that we assess the qualitative criteria.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The cloud computing implementation group held its last formal meeting in March 2012 and submitted a report on its work on 14 June 2012.  I have asked my Department to prepare targets and measurements based on the report's key findings which will allow us to monitor progress to ensure we maximise the potential of this important area of the ICT sector.In conducting its work, the group examined the opportunities and challenges presented by cloud computing for both business and government from the following perspectives: the cloud as a source for exports, growth and jobs; the adequacy of key infrastructures; the regulatory environment; the opportunities and benefits for indigenous enterprises; the opportunities for attracting foreign direct investment; and government as a leader and user of the cloud.  The group's work was informed by a parallel process of engagement which resulted in the Department convening more than 20 meetings with representative bodies and individual companies in September and October 2011.Considerable insight and information was gained during the process and this is being examined to assess the best way forward and the practical steps that can be taken to optimise the potential of cloud.  In the meantime, a number of other initiatives related to cloud computing are under way, including under the action plan for jobs.  These include the €1.2 million initial research programme in the cloud computing technology centre announced in April, which is aimed at helping to make Ireland a world leader in this fast growing area and at making a significant contribution to jobs and economic growth.  The initiatives also include the ICT skills action plan, which was launched earlier this year and includes the provision of courses relevant to the skills required for the cloud computing industry.  The National Standards Association of Ireland, with the assistance and support of the Irish Internet Association, IIA, has developed the SWiFT 10 guide, which is aimed at businesses of all sizes considering the adoption of cloud computing.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In addition, the Data Protection Commissioner has placed information on its website which will be useful for businesses moving to the cloud, with an obvious emphasis on the data protection issues related to such a move.  I understand the public sector strategy on cloud computing is close to finalisation in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and will be published shortly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I agree with everything the Deputy has said.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is engaging on its usefulness for reducing costs in the public sector and there is much concentration on this in the wider public sector.  Membership of the group varies from people involved in industry to those in the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We all realise its value and we know who in industry operates in this sphere, for example EMC in my area.  There is a strong sense the cloud computing strategy can set new targets for investment in digital media and the Internet when one considers existing opportunities for technology companies and new and emerging areas.  We will marry with this the potential for data centres and the consideration of Ireland for potential inward investment for these.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has specific responsibility for this area.  I do not know whether the Deputy has engaged with him on this matter, but I suggest he does so because he would get a definitive answer on what we are doing with regard to broadband.For the purposes of addressing the issue of the potential of cloud computing, I realise certain businesses operating in certain geographical areas will face challenges and there is no question about this.  We will spend €1.2 million on an initial research programme and a cloud computing technology centre.  With regard to the potential of this area, we are looking at hitting global research targets and pitching Ireland's potential globally.  The National Standards Authority of Ireland has adopted the SWiFT 10 guide and I would like to find out how many businesses are aware of this at present.  If we can build consciousness about the potential of cloud computing in tandem with meeting the challenges with regard to broadband we will be doing well in terms of meeting global measurements.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	If the Deputy is concerned about a specific course I would welcome further information on it and I am happy to speak directly to him on this matter.  Cork Institute of Technology, in tandem with industry, has developed a specific course on this.  Mr. Bob Savage of EMC is on the governing body of CIT so one is confident this course has large industry buy-in.  If the industry has problems with or concerns about courses we need to hear about them.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Government is tackling unemployment generally through the twin strategies of the action plan for jobs and the Pathways to Work scheme.  The aim of the action plan for jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016, while the objective of Pathways to Work is to provide those who are unemployed with the appropriate training and skills to avail of the job opportunities which will arise as the economy recovers.  The long-term unemployed are a priority target group for the measures in Pathways to Work.While many of the new measures included in the action plan for jobs are not confined to those who are long-term unemployed, they will be of particular relevance to their needs.  For example, the microenterprise loan fund will provide funds for people who wish to start businesses in their local economies but have been refused credit by the banks.  Other measures such as the Revenue job assist scheme, which is used by employers to take on persons who are long-term unemployed, are being promoted both by extension of the coverage of the schemes in the Finance Bill and through the dissemination of information.  The employer job (PRSI) incentive scheme has been simplified and extended.  This scheme provides exemption from the payment of employer PRSI contributions for 18 months when a qualifying unemployed person is recruited.Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting over 85,000 job placement, work experience and back to education beneficiaries this year, including through the JobBridge internship programme.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has announced 1,000 additional places on JobBridge this year.  The Department of Education and Skills will provide more than 450,000 education and training places this year across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors, including through the Springboard programme.  More than 3,500 people have graduated from the first round of Springboard programmes, which were put in place in 2011, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, recently announced a further 6,000 new places on the programme for 2012.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We all acknowledge that over the past years this country has gone through major restructuring in terms of how the economy works.  The Minister already stated that if all the eggs are in one sector and if it fails, it has a monstrous effect on the economy.  We are trying to put in place a set of programmes which will allow people to upskill and retrain, so that we have a skillset.  I mention the number of construction jobs alone which were lost.  The only way we can get people back into the workforce is to upskill and retrain them but that does not happen within one, two or three months.  We must allow time for that to take effect.All sides of the House must acknowledge - let us be apolitical about this - that we have provided incentives on the Revenue side and on the employer side and we have allowed for credit to be made available through the micro-enterprise partial loan guarantee scheme.  The Government is actively intervening to try to stimulate the economy and to create the right conditions.I take the point made about the cost to business and a reduction in the regulatory burden.  I would acknowledge that we need to do more on EU targets in terms of the cost of the regulatory burden but I would also say there is a discussion at Cabinet level in regard to local authority funding and the cost to business at local level.  Local authorities cannot continue to rely, in the way they have done, on the ratepayers who have been squeezed in terms of funding local government.  The Cabinet is discussing this issue.  However, one must acknowledge that because of the tidal wave which hit us as a result of the collapse in the construction sector, in particular, which had fuelled the economy, we had to restructure the economy on macroeconomic grounds and put in place these types of programmes which do not bear fruit in the timeframe about which the Deputy spoke.  It will take longer.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 16 together.In November 2011 the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, TD, announced a new Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) to encourage individuals currently or formerly in employment to establish new business ventures. The changes introduced by the Minister for Finance included a widening of the types of companies eligible under the Scheme. This widening of the scope of the scheme removed the requirement for certification by Enterprise Ireland.The scheme provides for a refund of tax already paid by an individual who sets up and takes employment in a new qualifying business. The scheme, which is operated by the Revenue Commissioners, who have details on their website, allows for promoters of qualifying start-up companies to claim a rebate on investments made in their new enterprise based on the individual's income tax payments for the previous 6 years.  The individual claiming relief must be a full time employee or a full time director of the company.In the past entrepreneurs/investors seeking to avail of this tax relief had to seek certification from the relevant State agency supporting their sector. Enterprise Ireland, along with other Government Departments and bodies, was responsible for the provision of certificates in respect of certain qualifying trading operations.I understand that since 2003, under the initial Seed Capital Scheme Enterprise Ireland issued approximately 335 Seed Capital Certificates.  This corresponds to the number of applications for such certificates made by clients of EI.  The issue of a certificate by Enterprise Ireland did not guarantee, and did not imply, that Revenue would approve a rebate under the Scheme.Communicating information on government and agency supports that are available to companies to foster growth and enable job creation has been at the core of the Action Plan for Jobs agenda.  Minister Bruton has, along with his ministerial colleagues, promoted a range of supports for business, including the Seed Capital Scheme at Action Plan for Jobs workshops across the country. Information on the Seed Capital Scheme along with other government supports is available on my Department's website under ‘Supports for Business for Job Creation and Productivity'. Similarly, Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBS) provide information on this and other Government supports via their websites and through regular engagement with their clients.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 37 together.The Development Capital Scheme as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs has been developed to complement the existing suite of financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland.  A range of other initiatives are already in place for the provision of capital at the early stage and scaling phases, and a clear market failure was identified in the availability of risk capital for established companies seeking to sustain growth and achieve greater scale.Longer-term investment capital is currently not readily available to Irish growth focused companies in either the form of debt or equity, and there is very limited private equity funds/debt available to innovative SMEs.  This situation has resulted in an equity gap, which is constraining the development of a key cohort of established Irish growth companies.  Development Capital can be defined as equity funding for the expansion of established and profitable firms, that is, those that have passed the start-up stage.The exchequer funding requirement for this scheme is €50m over 10 years.  It is proposed that EI will commit €25m each to two funds which will leverage a further €50m each from the private sector. Any fund investments supported by EI under this scheme would be made with the State sharing equally in the risks alongside other investors.  The proposed scheme will focus on funds that provide equity or quasi debt of between €2m to €10m per investment although it is likely that many investments would be in the €2m to €5m range.The Scheme was launched on the 12th April 2012 and a call was issued by Enterprise Ireland for ‘ expressions of interest’, from fund managers, with a closing date of 16th  July 2012, for receipt of expressions.Enterprise Ireland is currently in discussion with a number of fund managers, both local and international, regarding their interest in the scheme. On completion of the call, valid applications will be evaluated based on the published criteria and a recommendation made to the Board of Enterprise Ireland. The final commitment to invest will be made by the Board of Enterprise Ireland. Once the selected fund managers have raised sufficient capital to ‘close' their fund, funding under the Development Capital Scheme will be available to invest.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	There is a wide range of diverse supports for different types of research and development across a number of Government Departments and State Agencies. There are no plans, at present, to streamline application processes for this diverse range of R&D supports across all research funders. The application criteria for research in, say, medical devices would be very different from the application criteria for an energy project.However, in line with the recommendations of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group's Report, for the purpose of competitive calls for funding, research funding Agencies will be adapting their application process to the stage-gate process.  This means that research funders will consider how to assess relevance to, and impact on, one of the 14 priority areas of opportunity identified as likely to deliver economic and societal impact. While obviously recognising the need to allow sufficient flexibility to accommodate the outcomes required by specific programmes, it is envisaged that Agencies will ensure that relevance to the priority areas is one of the key criteria in assessing applications and in this way will ensure a degree of consistency across agencies. The stage gate model will not apply to in-company R&D funding.In addition, the Research Prioritisation Steering Group's Report recommended there should be coherence and a consistency of approach between funding programmes to reduce the administration burden on both agencies and applicants and also to allow for system level evaluations. Implementation of this recommendation will be considered by the Prioritisation Action Group in as part of its ongoing sequencing of reforms.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Under the Europe 2020 Strategy, the European Council adopted a number of headline targets, including improving the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 3% of GDP by 2020. In accordance with the Strategy, Member States have adopted national targets on the basis of these headline targets, as set out in their National Reform Programmes, taking account of their relative starting positions and national circumstances and Ireland's target in relation to R&D is as set out above.In light of current economic circumstances and participation in the EU/IMF Programme, Ireland's National Reform Programme, transmitted to the European Commission on 29 April 2011, specified that Ireland's target in relation to expenditure on R&D is to improve the conditions for research and development, in particular with the aim of raising combined public and private investment levels to 2.5% of GNP (approximately equivalent to 2.0% of GDP) by 2020.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The salary sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland, Professor Mark Ferguson, is €189,115 gross per annum.  This includes a personal pension contribution rate.  Professor Ferguson commenced in the post on 16th January 2012.
