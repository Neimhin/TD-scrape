[<p eid="para_674">By way of preamble I draw attention to how the Minister's language has shifted considerably from the statement in Limoges where he said that the sector "should be a priority for any unused funds within the CAP budget".  Last night he indicated: "I wanted to ensure that the changes in the health check initiative will open the possibility for some useful action."  Now the Minister is stating that he "may" use some of the €24 million fund to support the sheep sector.  What the farmers who are protesting on Kildare Street want to know is whether the fund will be used.  Will the Minister give a definitive commitment that he will honour the statement that was made at the conference in Limoges?  Given that the Minister has committed to meeting representatives of the sector, will he move the date of 16 December forward given that the farmers are protesting outside Leinster House?  It would be courteous if the Minister committed to meeting them earlier than 16 December.</p>]
[<p eid="para_678">Is the Minister now telling us he cannot commit the unspent CAP funds to the sheep sector?  Will he respond with a "Yes" or a "No"?</p>]
[<p eid="para_680">On a point of order, there are people outside this building who are awaiting the answer to that question.  They are either labouring under a misapprehension regarding the Minister's statements or they are not.  Did the Minister make a commitment that he would allocate unused CAP funds to the sheep sector?</p>]
[<p eid="para_683">With all due respect to the Minister, he is shifting his position.</p>]
[<p eid="para_685">There is a subtle shift.</p>]
[<p eid="para_687">Is the answer to my question "Yes" or "No"?</p>]
[<p eid="para_690">The Minister should just answer the question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_713">Will the Minister clarify whether the original ratio in the rural development package was to be 50:50 between EU funding and Exchequer funding?  In the event of Exchequer funding being at 25%, will the Government commit to that funding in light of the new modulation or the Common Agricultural Policy health check package?</p>]
[<p eid="para_716">I welcome the Minister's statement in terms of the commitment on modulation and how it is to be ringfenced within agriculture.  That is vitally important and is something I have raised with the Minister previously.  There should be no leakage of that commitment into other sectors, or into non-governmental, community and voluntary pillars.  That is essential.</p>, <p eid="para_717">Does the Minister not agree that the €170 million package delivered by the CAP will be delivered by farmers themselves?  The 1% increase in quota will effectively come down to the farmer who gets up every day to milk more cows.  The Minister is overselling the package somewhat.  It was widely thought that the 1% increases in quota were coming down the track in any event.</p>, <p eid="para_718">Will the Minister explain the €70 million that is in the balance?  Some €100 million will be provided for additional milk production and there is an extra €70 million.  Will the Minister clarify how this extra sum will be designated?</p>]
[<p eid="para_807">On a point of order, did the Minister state the EU has not sought any regulation in this regard to harmonise the situation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_850">If I had two seconds extra, I would have come in on cue but I was being given a briefing by the Deputy from south-west Cork.</p>]
[<p eid="para_852">I note Deputy Creed was quick off the mark.  Anyway, as somebody who posed the question, even though it is in the name of Deputy Liz McManus, I wish to put on record that I do not see why this is so, there is not any legal impediment and there is no European Union directive that states that the Minister cannot extend the deadline to allow for this scheme to be implemented.  The scheme is revenue neutral.</p>, <p eid="para_853">I do not see why, if it can be done on one part of this island, it cannot be done on another part of this island.  It defies logic.  Farmers in the North are farming the same types of land as farmers in the South.  I cannot see the logic of the Government's position on this matter.  I do not see why the Minister cannot change his mind on it.  I ask the Minister to consider changing his mind on it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1596">Hear, hear.</p>]
[<p eid="para_2177">I raise this issue because there is deep concern in Fermoy about proposals made by the OPW to replace the weir in the town with a rock ramp pass.  People fear for their rowing club which some argue has been in existence since Adam was a boy.  They fear that if the weir is replaced by a rock ramp, it will have untold consequences for the water level in the River Blackwater, thus negating the amenity value of the rowing club.</p>, <p eid="para_2178">Why is the Government proceeding with this folly?  There is no justification for the project.  The OPW's flood alleviation works were sanctioned and welcomed but it is now seeking to change the weir, to which there seems to be no logic.  When I put a question to the Minister on the issue on 4 November, I was told the direction had been issued in the interests of conserving wild salmon resources and avoiding the initiation of infringement proceedings by the European Commission under the habitats directive on foot of a complaint lodged with the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission.</p>, <p eid="para_2179">Given that the Government is seeking to adhere to the habitats directive, the people of Fermoy and I would like to know the nature of the complaint and who lodged it.  We want to know the justification for it.  If it is to ensure enough salmon can get up the river, plenty of salmon are being caught by rod on the river.  It does not require the destruction of the weir to ensure more salmon can get up the river because there is a much cheaper solution that would ensure the continuation of a fish pass without compromising the valuable amenity constituted by the rowing club in Fermoy.</p>, <p eid="para_2180">We want to ensure the future viability of the rowing club.  We do not see the economic justification for the proposal in the current climate.  If the Minister of State tells me that the project is being carried out by the OPW because Fermoy Town Council cannot afford to do so, she should note that the former Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, visited the town in 2006.  Two years have passed since his visit and the project is to be hitched to an OPW flood alleviation plan, to which there is no logic to whatsoever.  The people of Fermoy cannot comprehend it.</p>, <p eid="para_2181">The EU habitats directive is being used as a battering ram to carry out the project.  There is no justification for this.  If there was a complaint lodged to the Environment Directorate-General of the Commission, will the Minister of State make a copy of it available to the House in order that Members will know exactly who is behind the works?  I do not believe for one moment that the OPW is fully responsible and believe there are other mechanisms at play.  I would go so far as to say the Southern Regional Fisheries Board is the main instigator and that it is seeking to justify its position.  It will gladly sacrifice a rowing club to this end but should realise that, ultimately, as many salmon will get up the river without a rock ramp as they would if one were installed.  Hiding behind the fallacy of a habitats directive is typical of a Government which has used the European Union when it wants to push through some bad proposals.  This project will have an adverse effect on the community in Fermoy.  I ask the Government to rethink its strategy, particularly in the current economic climate.</p>]
