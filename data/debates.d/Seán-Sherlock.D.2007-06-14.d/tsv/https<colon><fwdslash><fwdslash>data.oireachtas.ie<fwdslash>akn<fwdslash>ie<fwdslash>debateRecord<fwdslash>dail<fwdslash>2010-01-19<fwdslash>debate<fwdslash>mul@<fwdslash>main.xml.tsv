SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the current appalling condition of roads in County Cork; and to ask the Minister for Transport to increase funding for the maintenance of county and non-national roads in that county, and to examine why the road network in County Cork is severely under-funded and why funding for roadways in Cork is considerably lower per kilometre compared to most other counties in the State.
