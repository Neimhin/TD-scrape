SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission, I, too, wish to warmly congratulate Deputy Connick on his accession to the position of Minister of State.  I wish him well and look forward to working with him.I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  If the scheme is designed with biodiversity in mind, will the Minister of State acknowledge that hedgerows in particular and road margins and the biodiversity within are being threatened by the illegal dumping of plastics, which, in turn, will have an effect on biodiversity over time?  Will he also acknowledge that there could be an opportunity, through this scheme, for farmers to work in partnership with the local authorities to ensure drainage mechanisms are put in place?  We could potentially have an arterial drainage type scheme at a local level and could also, by incentivising farmers to maintain the hedge rows, create from this some degree of income.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I believe this is a missed opportunity.  If the scheme is so diverse, is not a whole farm scheme and relates to issues such as tree planting, moor land grazing, lake catchments, mixed grazing and conservation of wild bird habitat then I honestly believe an opportunity has gone abegging to do something to stem the tide of illegal dumping and to bring farmers and landowners into partnership in terms of seeking to alleviate that problem.  I accept the Minister of State's response.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am glad the Minister of State mentioned the word "flooding" because one can have all the nitrates alleviation measures in the world, but if one does not tackle the issue of flooding it does not amount to anything.  Would the Minister of State acknowledge that since the serious flooding last year nothing has been done, in concrete terms, to instigate measures which would prevent such flooding happening again, in particular in the Shannon basin region?  The consultation process is lagging behind the need for direct action on flooding events, such as those we saw in the west and throughout the Shannon region.  Action is now needed and it precedes the consultation process.  We should not envisage a situation in the coming months like that which we saw previously, in terms of its effect on agriculture.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State is in a position to change the system now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am also reassured by the Minister's reply.  Given the alleged breaches of contract, will a mechanism be introduced to facilitate the compensation of farmers for loss of contract?  Potentially, the company has abused its dominant position by allegedly breaching contracts.  What is the Minister's view on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Not if one is loyal to Beamish.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We all have to be seen to be doing something when it comes to the dairy sector but it appears that every mechanism that could be put in place has been put in place.  I refer to the market management regime, the export refund scheme and intervention stocks.  Will the Minister acknowledge that until such time as there is a pick-up in global demand that the system will remain as it is for some time?  Perhaps I am wrong but it appears that not much more can be done in terms of intervening to facilitate a recovery until such time as global demand for milk and milk-based products picks up.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I do not have access to the tabular information.  However, I accept the Minister's reply.  In posing the question I was interested in finding out why farmers were becoming liable for penalties and what was the source of the non-compliance.  If we had a record of that information, matters could be rectified in future.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How many did not submit payment claims or did so late?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister stated the problem in Kerry was sorted today.  What exactly does he mean by that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When can the farmers expect their payments?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I should say at the outset that Cobh community hospital is a facility that is very well-regarded by the people of Cobh.  I have been asked by my Labour Party colleagues on Cobh Town Council to raise this issue as a matter of urgency because there is a situation whereby the National Treatment Purchase Fund has taken over the fair deal scheme as it relates to Cobh hospital.  That will have serious permutations for the cost per patient per week in that it is stated that the possible drop in fees from €1,200 to €800 per bed per week could result in a serious deficit.  Obviously a deficit in funding would have an impact on the ability of the patients to remain within the hospital in the first instance, but also severely impact on the hospital's ability to take in new patients.It is a 38-bed hospital and there are approximately 40 staff.  What goes to the heart of this is the issue whereby care for our older people who are in community-based facilities is being eroded by this Government through a process of stealth.  The Government's model of health care is about rolling back the State and these wonderful community-based facilities so that they may be completely and utterly subsumed into a private nursing home model, thereby rolling back the stakesholdings that communities have within these hospitals which make them the excellent facilities they are.  It is all being done under the wonderful guise of HIQA rules and the fact that these institutions are older.  Anything that is deemed to be older in this new paradigm we have with this Government is deemed not to be of sufficient standard.I want to speak for hospitals such as Cobh, the welfare home in Youghal and Nazareth House in Mallow, all of which provide an excellent standard of care, but are now under threat because of the new rules that have come into play through the fair deal scheme and the new punishing HIQA standards.  All I want to do here is make the case for Cobh community hospital, in that it is an excellent facility.  There is a significant buy-in from the people of Cobh into this hospital.  The staff coterie is very loyal to the hospital.  The patients there are happy, and I would hope the Government ensures the continuation of this hospital in perpetuity, especially for the older people of Cobh who will use it, hopefully, into the future.
