[<p eid="para_388">Amendment No. 1 provides that a company is to be treated as a small company if it qualified as a small company for the most recent financial year ended before the application for examinership. Under section 8 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 a company qualifies as a small company if it meets the qualifying conditions in respect of a financial year. In the Bill, as initiated, the subsection did not reflect that and referred instead to "at the time of the presentation of the petition". There was no reference to a financial year.</p>]
[<p eid="para_402">I will respond first to Senator Sean D. Barrett's remarks and thank him for his kind words of welcome. The costs of an examinership will depend not only on the capitalisation or book value of the assets of a company but also on the nature and extent of the company's liabilities and the complexity of a particular case. Hence, it would be extremely difficult to estimate the cost of a typical examinership on which to base annual estimates of savings. To draw robust estimates would require information from the individual companies who applied for Circuit Court examinership and require them to estimate the savings from choosing the Circuit Court option over the High Court route. This would be a hypothetical exercise and necessarily subjective. To compel companies to co-operate in such a process would require legislation, which would also add to the administrative burden on companies.</p>, <p eid="para_403"> As the House may be aware, Standing Order 141A of the Dáil provides that 12 months after the enactment of a Bill, the Minister or Minister of State, who is officially responsible for implementation of an Act, shall provide a report, which shall review the functioning of the Act and which shall be laid in the Oireachtas Library. A report on the implementation of the Bill before the House today will be required 12 months after its enactment. Therefore, the amendment is not practical or necessary and I do not propose to accept it.</p>, <p eid="para_404"> Other Senators spoke about the cost of legal services and the top four that Senator Denis O'Donovan mentioned.</p>]
[<p eid="para_406">Notwithstanding the valid points made, I respectfully suggest that these issues should be dealt with under the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which is before the Dáil. I note the points made and they will certainly be reflected back to the relevant Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_411">I return to my response to the amendment. The 30% figure mentioned in public discourse on the issue refers to the estimated Circuit Court costs being 30% lower than an examinership process through the High Court owing to the legal fees element. If we do not know how many companies will go into examinership from today and 12 months hence, how can we reasonably expect to create an estimate of the cost saving? It is a hypothetical exercise. While greatly respecting the Senator's views on the issue, we would create an enormous administrative burden - another administrative layer - in compiling the estimate.</p>, <p eid="para_412"> Knowing the Senator as I do, I know he would not stand over creating another administrative layer in the system that would result in Departments going out to individual companies which applied for Circuit Court examinership and then putting a requirement on them to estimate the savings from choosing one court over another. In an individual company's case it would mean in practical terms that company having to get two separate pieces of legal advice which would create an administrative burden for it. It is not reasonable to compel companies to engage in such an exercise because we would need to create a legislative framework for that. Furthermore, as I have said in the response, a report on the functioning of the Act will need to be compiled and laid in the Oireachtas Library, which should be sufficient.</p>, <p eid="para_413"> The estimated savings of 30% derive from the potential difference in the legal costs between the Circuit Court and a higher court. That is where that figure comes from. I respect the Senator's views on the issue, but the Government is unable to accept the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_421">This amendment relates to the power of seizure. It is more of a semantic explanation. The new section will provide for an officer of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to be able to take over the statutory duties set out under sections 20(2E) and 20(2F) of the Companies Act 1990 in circumstances where the incumbent designated officer is no longer in a position to carry them out. The duties under sections 20(2E) and 20(2F) arise if a named officer of the director has been issued with a section 20 search warrant under which "extended powers of seizure" are exercised. The proposed new section will provide that if a designated officer named in a search warrant has ceased to be an officer of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or is otherwise unable to act, then another designated officer may apply to a judge of the District Court for an order that his or her name be substituted for the original designated officer's name on the search warrant.</p>, <p eid="para_422"> This section is contained in the Companies Bill 2012 but is being brought forward to ensure that the process is in place should the need arise. Effectively, if a designated officer should pass away or be incapacitated and needs to be replaced, the amendment allows for the procedure to take place and for the application to the court to be provided for.</p>, <p eid="para_423">SECTION 5</p>]
[<p eid="para_424">This amendment is effectively the same. Its purpose is to include the Insolvency Service of Ireland as one of the agencies in the list of bodies that may share information with the director. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Insolvency Service of Ireland has the power to share information with the Director of Corporate Enforcement that it considers relevant to an investigation of the director.</p>, <p eid="para_425"> It is foreseeable that there will be overlaps between the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. For example, the two bodies may be dealing with the same individuals as directors of insolvent companies and as individuals subject to personal insolvency proceedings. The inclusion of the reference to the Insolvency Service of Ireland has necessitated the consequential reordering of the other clauses in the paragraph.</p>]
[<p eid="para_455">With the permission of the Chair, may I speak to amendments Nos. 11 and 13 together?</p>]
[<p eid="para_457">I wish to reiterate the wording of the amendment in order that from my perspective I can stay focused on the amendment. Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_458">The Recognised Accountancy Bodies remain the oversight bodies for the external quality assurance of audits until the enactment of this Act and shall retain the duties and obligations of such oversight up to and including that date.</p>, <p eid="para_459">Under Chapter 2, Part 8 of the European Communities (Statutory Audits) (Directive 2006/43/EC) Regulations 2010, SI No. 220 of 2010, the recognised accountancy bodies have the power and do carry out quality assurance of their members' activities as statutory auditors and audit firms. This will remain the position until the power is formally transferred to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, the IAASA. Section 6 of the Bill provides for a levy, this speaks to the points made by Senator Sean D. Barrett, on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities in order to defray the costs to the IAASA for carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of these public interest entities.</p>, <p eid="para_460"> The amendment is unnecessary. Additional functions in regard to the EU recommendation on external quality assurance are proposed to be conferred on the IAASA in the Companies Bill 2012 while the balance of the related functions would be conferred on IAASA by amendment to existing regulations. The commencement of section 6 will not occur until all the relevant functions have been transferred.</p>, <p eid="para_461"> I believe amendment No. 13 is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it. The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority produces an annual report of its activities each year, which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The IAASA can also be called to appear before any Oireachtas committee and it has appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in December 2012. The provision in regard to quality assurance in this Bill is strictly confined to empowering the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority to impose a levy again on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities to defray the costs to it for carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of those public interest entities. Currently the recognised accountancy bodies, RABs who carry out the quality assurance function have the power to sanction their members, including by withdrawal of the authorisation to audit certificate. It is intended that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA will have equivalent powers of sanctions when the functions are transferred and these powers again will be contained in the Companies Bill 2012 or the regulations, as appropriate.</p>, <p eid="para_462"> First, let me speak on the amendment before us and be clear about the Government's position on it. Other points have been made by Senator Sean D. Barrett and we could have a very long debate on the morass in society. I do not think it was only the accountants who were part of the morass. Many others were part of it also.</p>, <p eid="para_463"> For the purposes of dealing with some of the points the Senator raised, it is important to address the issue in relation to investigations and proceedings against particular members of those accountancy bodies. Investigations and proceedings against members of accountancy bodies in relation to events at the former Anglo Irish Bank were suspended at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions in order that such moves would not prejudice forthcoming criminal trials. It is important to state that in response to quite a large component of the Senator's contribution.</p>, <p eid="para_464"> The Senator critiqued section 6 in its entirety, but that section gives effect to a European Commission recommendation on external quality assurance for statutory auditors and audit firms. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, may have addressed this issue during the Second Stage debate, but I want to state again that if we are talking about quality assurance in relation to section 6, it is important we note that quality assurance is the regular inspection of statutory auditors and audit firms to ensure systems are in place that will allow for consistently high quality audits. The transfer of the important quality assurance function to an independent oversight body such as IAASA will strengthen oversight of the audit process in Ireland as regards these public interest entities. This should help to restore confidence in audit in Ireland, which has been dented as a result of the so-called clean audit opinions given to the financial statements of systemically important credit institutions, which as the Senator rightly pointed out, later proved to be near or actually insolvent.</p>, <p eid="para_465"> The transfer of the function to IAASA is to be fully funded by the relevant statutory auditors and audit firms with no cost to the Exchequer, apart from once-off start-up costs such as office equipment and so on. This is in line with existing practice where statutory auditors and audit firms pay for this function. The only difference is that this payment will be to IAASA and not the recognised accountancy body of which they are a member. The cost of such reviews under the proposed system is likely to be greater because the quality assurance process will be more thoroughgoing than heretofore. This is understood not to be a difficulty for the statutory audit firms concerned and they do not have a problem with it.</p>, <p eid="para_466"> If IAASA is to undertake these additional quality assurance functions, significant additional resources will be required by that entity. Again in June last year, the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wrote to his counterpart in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform seeking sanction for IAASA to recruit 11 additional staff. This has been proceeded by meetings between officials of both Departments. Again, Senator Sean D. Barrett referred to that issue. I hope this addresses the substantive wording of the amendment as proposed by the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_474">As I neglected to respond to Senator Denis O'Donovan's query, I shall clarify the matter. The co-operative movement is regulated by different legislation. It is intended to introduce an amendment to the industrial and providence societies legislation to provide for Circuit Court examinership where it applies to co-operatives.</p>]
[<p eid="para_476">Will the Senator allow me to revert to him on the matter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_478">I thank the Senator. I wish to clarify that the Government will not be accepting the amendments proposed by Senator Sean D. Barrett.</p>, <p eid="para_479"> We all need to restore confidence in the system. The points made by the Senator are necessary and we are trying to restore confidence in accounting, auditing and oversight procedures. The legislation provides that the IAASA will have an independent oversight of the process which is a step towards restoring confidence. We need to ensure there is no ambiguity about the quality of the audits and that they stand up to rigorous and independent scrutiny. Essentially, that is what the legislation is about in this instance. </p>, <p eid="para_480"> I have just received a note for Senator Denis O'Donovan's benefit. The Bill that he inquired about has been published and awaits Second Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_488">I wish to make a comment before the Senator makes a decision to withdraw or push his amendment. In section 6, "public interest entities" are defined as having the same meaning as in Regulation 3 of 2010, SI No. 220 of 2010, which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_489">(<i>a</i>) companies or other bodies corporate governed by the law of a Member State whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market of any Member State within the meaning of point 14 of Article 4(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC,</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_490">(<i>b</i>) credit institutions as defined in point 1 of Article 1 of Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions, and</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_491">(<i>c</i>) insurance undertakings within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 91/674/EEC.</p>, <p eid="para_492">I hope my explanation proves helpful to the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_506">I do not propose to accept the amendment as it would not be appropriate for a party which is not privy to a legal action to be required to pay any costs in regard to that action. Cost in any court action are determined by the courts and they fall to be discharged by the parties involved in that action as determined by the court.</p>]
[<p eid="para_512">I would like to give notification of the Government's intention to introduce an amendment on Report Stage. I will read out the substance of that amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_514">It will be a new section before section 8. It is what we call "<i>lastminute.com</i>". As indicated during the Second Stage debate, it is proposed to introduce, at the request of the Minister for Justice and Equality, a number of amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and the Bankruptcy Act 1988 on Report Stage. For the convenience of Senators, I will circulate an explanation of the amendments.</p>, <p eid="para_515"> The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 amendments will involve the insertion of a new section in page 11, between lines 14 and 15. The proposed amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act relate to the debt relief notice process provided in that Act. The process is one of the key judicial debt resolution instruments in the Act and, subject to relevant conditions, allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to €20,000, subject to a three year supervision period.</p>, <p eid="para_516">The amendments are designed to respond to issues raised by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and will assist the MABS approved intermediaries in commencing the operation of the debt relief notice process in the 2012 Act and ensure greater clarity for debtors and creditors alike.</p>, <p eid="para_517"> In brief, it is proposed to amend the Personal Insolvency Act:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_518">(a) in section 25, by substituting the following definition for the definition of "debt":</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_519">" "debt", in relation to a debtor, means a debt for a liquidated sum that, on the application date, is payable either immediately or at some future time;";</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_520">(b) in section 26, by deleting subsection (4);</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_521">(c) in section 27(6), by substituting the following for paragraph (a):</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_522">" (a) the information contained in the debtor's Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate in all material respects, and",</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_523">(d) in section 43(3)(b), by substituting the following for subparagraph (v):</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_524">"(v) the procedural requirements specified in this Chapter were not complied with;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_525">(vi) the debtor has by his or her conduct within the period of 6 months ending on the application date arranged his or her financial affairs primarily with a view to being or becoming eligible for the issue of a Debt Relief Notice.", and</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_526">(e) in section 44(3), by substituting the following for paragraph (f):</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_527">"(f) the procedural requirements specified in this Chapter were not complied with;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_528">(g) the debtor has by his or her conduct within the period of 6 months ending on the application date arranged his or her financial affairs primarily with a view to being or becoming eligible for the issue of a Debt Relief Notice.".</p>, <p eid="para_529"> The Bankruptcy Act amendments will involve the insertion of a new section in page 11 between lines 14 and 15.</p>, <p eid="para_530"> With the objective of reducing the costs associated with bankruptcy, the Insolvency Service of Ireland has proposed that it would provide, cost free, a facility on its website for a bankrupt to "notice" that fact as required by law. Currently, only publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and a newspaper are permitted. This change could save a bankrupt up to €500 in newspaper costs.</p>, <p eid="para_531"> The textual amendment to a number of relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to prescribe how notice was to be given by the bankrupt.</p>, <p eid="para_532"> A further proposed amendment to section 140A(5) would permit the relevant register to be maintained in electronic format. As a consequence, I am considering bringing forward amendments to section 8, that is, the commencement provision. The proposed amendments outlined above will necessitate an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_533"> For the Senators' benefit, I wish to inform them that the proposed amendments will be subject to full discussion on Report Stage. There is no ambiguity about this. This is merely a notification to Senators that they are being brought forward. There will be no issue on Report Stage about ensuring these amendments are discussed thoroughly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_535">As a proud Munster man, we have a fairly stout record against the All Blacks, but I will revert to the Senator on that issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_536">I wish to clarify that we will bring forward on Report Stage a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill to take account of the amendments being made to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and the Bankruptcy Act 1988.</p>]
