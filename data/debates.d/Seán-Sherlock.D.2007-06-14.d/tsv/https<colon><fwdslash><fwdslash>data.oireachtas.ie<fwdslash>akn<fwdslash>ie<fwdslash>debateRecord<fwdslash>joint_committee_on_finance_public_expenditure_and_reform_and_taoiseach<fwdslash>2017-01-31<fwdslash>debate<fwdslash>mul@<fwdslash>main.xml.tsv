SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-01-31T13:10:00+00:00	I welcome the Commissioner. On 19 December our Department of Finance issued a statement setting out some clear and unambiguous views relating to the ruling or interpretation of the Commission. I will quote from the statement in the context of the various entities, including Apple Inc., Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe. I am trying to distil this for people who may not have technical knowledge, for example, ordinary citizens who are watching the proceedings. On 19 December the Department of Finance stated that the Commission's decision:The Decision also mischaracterises the activities and responsibilities of the Irish branches of ASI and AOE. These branches carried out routine functions, but all important decisions within ASI and AOE were made in the USA, and the profits deriving from these decisions were not properly attributable to the Irish branches of ASI and AOE.How does the Commissioner respond to that contention from our Department of Finance?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-01-31T13:15:00+00:00	Okay. In the Commission's contention, where is the intellectual property generated?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-01-31T13:15:00+00:00	How does the Commissioner respond to the view that Apple's intellectual property licences to the Irish branches of Apple Operations Europe and Apple Sales International are not consistent with Irish law? That is the view of our Department of Finance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-01-31T13:15:00+00:00	I would like to return to the issue of tax liability. The Commission has not been silent on the question of whether other member states or other countries have a call on the magical figure of €13 billion. What are the modalities the Commission is proposing for Ireland to set up a system for other countries to come calling for that €13 billion or a portion of it? I would like to examine the statement the Commissioner made to this effect - if I understood her correctly - when she said other countries might have a call on the €13 billion. I have listened carefully to what she has said as a Commissioner of the European Union about the importance of the Single Market. My view is that if the Commission is to make such a statement, it must also have a view on how other member states are to collect this money, if that is what will transpire in the final analysis.
