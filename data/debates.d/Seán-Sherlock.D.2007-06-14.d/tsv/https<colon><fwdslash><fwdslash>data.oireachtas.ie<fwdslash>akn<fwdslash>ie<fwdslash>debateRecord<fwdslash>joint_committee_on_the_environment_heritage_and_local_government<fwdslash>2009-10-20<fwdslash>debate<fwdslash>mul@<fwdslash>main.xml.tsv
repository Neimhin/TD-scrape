SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The second-last paragraph on page 3 of the IFA submission stated that because the nitrates regulations require slurry to be spread by the 15th of the month, the slurry was spread and good growing grass was spoiled.  Such grass is an essential and cost-effective fodder.On the science of prescribing a specific calendar date with regard to this cut-off point, can the delegates say, in all good scientific knowledge, that after the 15th any slurry spread will definitively fall into the water course or table and act as a pollutant?  If the answer is "No", is there now scope within the nitrates action plans — which presumably are to be negotiated next year — for a re-jigging of the system to allow for a greater degree of flexibility to offset the prohibitive nature of these so-called prohibitive periods?  It makes absolutely no sense to spread slurry at certain times of the year, given our weather patterns, especially this year, as speakers noted.  Such weather makes the spreading of slurry impossible.Are we now suggesting there must be a State slurry storage facility if we are to adhere to the rules and regulations, or will there be scope in any renegotiation of the nitrates action plan with the Commission to extend the deadlines or come up with some other system based on common sense?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked about the prohibitive periods and the negotiation of the nitrogen action plans for 2010.  Based on the answers we have received from Mr. Duggan, I am assuming there will be no change in the State's approach to the issue; I assume the status quo will remain in terms of our position on the matter.
