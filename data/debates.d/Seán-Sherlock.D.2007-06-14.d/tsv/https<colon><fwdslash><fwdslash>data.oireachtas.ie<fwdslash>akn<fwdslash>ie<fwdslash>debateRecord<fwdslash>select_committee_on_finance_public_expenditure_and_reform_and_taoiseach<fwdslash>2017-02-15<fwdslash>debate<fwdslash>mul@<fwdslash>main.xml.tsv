[<p eid="para_36">If I may, I will divide my questioning between estate management and flooding. I will start with estate management. I also join with the Chairman in welcoming the new Chairman of the OPW. I too worked in a previous guise with him through the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I am delighted to see him appointed to this role.</p>, <p eid="para_37"> It may not be possible for the Minister of State to answer my questions directly at this session. If he cannot, I would be grateful if somebody would revert to me. I want to raise sites like Barryscourt Castle, County Cork, Annes Grove Gardens in Castletownroche, County Cork, and Doneraile Court. They are three key reference sites that come under the ambit of the OPW's sphere of responsibility. I know that works are ongoing in Barryscourt Castle, for instance. The people who use these facilities are anxious to ensure there is continuing maintenance and development. I note the Minister of State's remarks with regard to Ireland's Ancient East and the reference to developing the heritage element of the OPW offerings. I ask the Minister to revert to me with regard to what the plans are for those three particular sites. The Annes Grove Gardens site, in particular, is a recent acquisition and a very valuable one in terms of its history and place in north Cork. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the resources are deployed in such a way as to ensure its future development.</p>, <p eid="para_38"> I note that there has been a 12.8% increase in revenue streams. I ask the Minister of State to delve further into how that 12.8% is arrived at in terms of attendance figures across the sites throughout the country. It is a cumulative increase. People like me, who represent the people of north and east Cork, would like to see how that translates to sites like Doneraile Court, Annes Grove Gardens and Barryscourt Castle, which is obviously closed at the moment. I would be very grateful if we could get some solid information from the Minister of State on the figures as they relate to those three reference sites. My next question is about the children's science centre. What is the actual state of progress on that? That is the first half of my intervention.</p>, <p eid="para_39"> The second half of my intervention relates to Cork in particular and the proposed flood works. I note the Minister of State said that the deadline for submissions has moved out to a date in March. There have been some concerns raised, of which the Minister will be aware, regarding the aesthetics that this project will bring and how that will impact on the visual amenity that people enjoy on the River Lee. Historically, on schemes like the Munster Blackwater in Fermoy as well as in Mallow, similar concerns were raised by people living within those regions. I can understand the concerns of the people of Cork city. I ask the Minister of State to be mindful of those concerns. I understand a process is under way. I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the aesthetic value of the River Lee and to be mindful of the need to ensure the visual amenity that is there. There are other concerns that will come into the public forum as time goes on.</p>, <p eid="para_40"> The Minister of State mentioned small schemes. There is still a situation arising from Storm Frank in 2015 where works are ongoing on the N25, east of Castlemartyr. I travelled on that road the other day and work has been carried out opposite a particular property. I do not want to name the person in question but he and his family have been very much affected by Storm Frank. There are turloughs present in the area. There has been no communication between the OPW and this person. To be fair to the person in question, aesthetically, opposite his house looks a bit like a bomb site at the moment. I do not want to inflame the situation in any way. However, if the OPW or its agents could communicate more with the people affected in that particular region, I believe it would be a good day's work.</p>, <p eid="para_41"> I also want to ask about the voluntary home relocation scheme. I would like to know what criteria apply. Do they include a person moving to an elevated site on their own property and building from scratch? Is that one of the areas that the Minister of State is examining? I would like to hear more about the modalities of the scheme, maybe not today, but perhaps at some future session. In fairness to the Minister of State with regard to his engagement on the insurance issue, he has been quite proactive to my mind. I had a meeting with the Minister of State prior to the Christmas recess. We are perhaps still sceptical about whether Insurance Ireland will actually take on board the CFRAM process and, having done that, whether it will reflect in lower costs in the premiums of people living in areas affected by CFRAM. That remains to be seen and I would like to hear the view of the Minister of State.</p>, <p eid="para_42"> Many people have carried out works in smaller areas, such as Castlemartyr in County Cork, which was badly affected, and places like Midleton. Some of those people had insurance, but others did not and had to pay out quite an amount of money to repair damaged property. They are looking for an answer to the question of whether Insurance Ireland will realistically engage and whether a real protocol will be put in place to ensure that, once the OPW has future-proofed a particular area that is within a certain flood plain, the cost of insurance will be reduced for people in the future. I acknowledge it is an ongoing process and I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on it. Those are my opening remarks.</p>]
[<p eid="para_44">Doneraile Court. It is a hardy perennial in my book. I want to know what are the numbers as it is a site that I want to see developing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">The Minister is considering the idea that somebody could build on their own land, subject to planning, if it is at a higher level.</p>]
[<p eid="para_52">What is the position on Insurance Ireland?</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">I have a final question on flood insurance and the Minister of State's engagement with Insurance Ireland. The demountable walls meet best international practice.</p>]
[<p eid="para_57">The Munster Blackwater scheme, at Fermoy in particular, was carried out by an internationally recognised consulting engineering firm, one of the best in the business globally. I cannot tally why that would not be accepted by Insurance Ireland or any insurance provider, if it is best international practice and these insurance houses are international insurance houses. It seems to me that the companies are refusing point blank to insure. That seems to be closer to the truth. The ultimate question for people who live in areas where work has been carried out and demountable walls are in place is whether there is a power to compel the companies to provide insurance.</p>]
[<p eid="para_281">I would like to move the conversation onto macroeconomic policy, specifically the Stability and Growth Pact. We are looking at the eurozone growth figures for the fourth quarter of this year and they are being revised downwards to something like 0.4% from 0.5%. I understand that letters have been issued to something like seven countries, although not to Ireland thankfully. Increasingly what we are seeing in respect of the Stability and Growth Pact is that there is a lot of focus on the stability but very little on the growth. I would like to get a perspective from the Minister as to where Ireland stands on, for instance, recent comments by the German finance Minister that there may need to be a review of the Stability and Growth Pact and where the politics of that rest at present within the EU.</p>, <p eid="para_282"> If we are looking at growth in our own economy and capital spending, obviously there is going to be a turf war on the capital spend. The Minister and I both inhabit the great province of Munster. We would be looking at regional economic development between Cork, Limerick and Galway and that Atlantic corridor. People representing the eastern side of the country would be looking at metro north, the M50 and other such projects. If we are to be realistic about proper investment in projects of this nature, there needs to be some degree of flexibility built in to, or a revision of, the Stability and Growth Pact because I think it is actually impeding the potential for growth. There cannot be growth without proper regional infrastructure. </p>, <p eid="para_283">I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that and on whether that conversation is being had by ECOFIN Ministers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_286">It is modest growth.</p>]
[<p eid="para_290">Is the Minister speaking about specific projects?</p>]
[<p eid="para_292">Does that include projects in Galway such as the Atlantic corridor connectivity?</p>]
