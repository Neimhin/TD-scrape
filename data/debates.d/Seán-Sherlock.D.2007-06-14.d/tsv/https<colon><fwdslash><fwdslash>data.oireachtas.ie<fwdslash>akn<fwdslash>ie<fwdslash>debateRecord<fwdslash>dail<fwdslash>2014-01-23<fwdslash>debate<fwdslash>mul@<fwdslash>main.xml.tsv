[<p eid="para_12">The Government is committed to the reform of the State's existing workplace relations services. The system that developed during the past 80 years has become unwieldy and complex and is no longer fit for purpose. There was universal acceptance of the need for a root and branch reform of the existing structures. The Minister's objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period. A new two-tier workplace relations structure, comprising two statutorily independent bodies to replace the current five, will be established. There will be a new single body of first instance - to be called the workplace relations commission - and a separate appeals body which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court.</p>, <p eid="para_13"> A significant amount of work has been completed on the preparation of the legislation which will give statutory effect to the new structures and associated processes. The draft scheme of the workplace relations Bill has been approved by the Government for priority drafting. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assigned resources to ensure the earliest possible publication of the Bill and drafting is under way. The Minister's intention is to publish the Bill as early as possible during the spring-summer Dáil session, with a view to the new structures being put in place during this year. The legislation will provide for the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to come together within the remit of the workplace relations commission. The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.</p>, <p eid="para_14"> Significant progress has also been achieved to date, in advance of the enabling legislation, in so far as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required are concerned to underpin the workplace relations reform programme, including the following measures which have already been put in place: the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department, to be part of the workplace relations commission; a single contact portal; an e-complaint facility; a staffing and structures plan; a new workplace relations website; an early resolution service; adjudicator training and recruitment plans; and enhanced technologies and processes, including the publication of a request for tender for a customer relationship management solution.</p>]
[<p eid="para_16">I accept the Deputy's point. Reforming a complex system takes time, but we are committed to that reform and the associated legislative process. From a public service delivery point of view, we must consider the situation as it stands. Prior to 2012, there were more than 100 possible first instance complaints involving 30 complaint forms which could be lodged with five separate bodies. The process of bringing everything together under a workplace relations commission is complex. Practitioners in this area have acknowledged that complexity. We must ensure the legislative approach we adopt is robust and will stand up to scrutiny. It is a case of kicking the tyres, so to speak, before we proceed. The workplace relations Bill will give statutory effect to the reforms we are bringing forward, but the enactment of the Bill will necessitate amendments to 22 primary Acts, 12 specified Parts or sections of Acts and 71 statutory instruments. We are committed to implementing these reforms.</p>]

[<p eid="para_131">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</p>, <p eid="para_132"> Overall, in 2014, we have set a target for gross job creation across the enterprise agencies of 27,500: 13,000 in IDA Ireland, 12,000 in Enterprise Ireland, and 2,500 for the LEOs. Targets are not set for individual sectors or the gender breakdown of job opportunities. However, I intend placing a particular focus on manufacturing in 2014.</p>, <p eid="para_133"> The sector had lost 50,000 jobs in the years up to 2010. It has seen a modest return to growth in employment over the past few years, with an additional 8,000 jobs having been created in the past year alone. There are now 213,600 directly employed in the sector in Ireland and when account is taken of indirect jobs supported, it now supports more than 427,000.</p>, <p eid="para_134"> The Forfás strategy for the manufacturing sector, which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, commissioned, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016. A complementary report was also published on skills needs by the expert group on future skills needs and Forfás.</p>, <p eid="para_135"> Arising from the strategy and the skills report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by the Department and relevant agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the Action Plan for Jobs. The manufacturing development forum is helping to address the key issues arising from the strategy recommendations which include delivering a national step change initiative to strengthen Ireland's manufacturing base across all firms, addressing perceptions of the sector as a career choice and removing barriers to the competitiveness of the sector in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_136"> As the Deputy will realise, innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors, but it is not possible to disaggregate the contribution made by innovation towards overall job creation in those sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. These programmes help companies become more innovative and encourage and support competitiveness.</p>, <p eid="para_137"> Taken together, we are confident that the measures I have outlined above will help grow sales and exports in the manufacturing and services sectors which in turn will lead to sustainable employment and a reduction in the live register.</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">No doubt cognisance would have to be taken of parts of the country where there are deficiencies. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, announced this morning an initiative to address broadband needs. In those parts of the country where, for instance, there is mainly familial-type manufacturing businesses that operate outside of larger conurbations, there are certain deficits but we are confident that those deficits will be addressed in the short term.</p>]
