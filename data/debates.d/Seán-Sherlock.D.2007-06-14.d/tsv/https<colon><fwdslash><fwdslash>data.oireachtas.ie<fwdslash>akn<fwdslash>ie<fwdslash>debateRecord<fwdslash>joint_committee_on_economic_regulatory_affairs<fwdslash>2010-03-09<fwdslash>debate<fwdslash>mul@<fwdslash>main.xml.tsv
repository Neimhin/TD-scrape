SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the representatives of the Irish Stock Exchange.  I want to continue in the same vein as Deputy O'Donnell.  I am trying to gain a better understanding of our regulatory position, particularly regarding the activities of stockbrokers.  If I understand the matter correctly, the markets in financial instruments directive has actually left a gap in the regulatory framework as it relates to non-consumer activity.  In other words, stockbrokers may not be investigated by the Irish Stock Exchange in regard to certain types of activities.  If I am wrong, I stand corrected.  Will the delegates flesh out the matter in layman's terms?I make this point because the delegates' submission states:It is important to note that MiFID did not provide an explicit mechanism for investigating non-consumer complaints against providers of financial services, including stockbrokers.  As the definition of "consumer" in Irish legislation is relatively narrow, the exchange was concerned that this previously available mechanism was to be removed.I presume it is still removed but housed under the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is it non-existent?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That clarifies the issue.  I appreciate the clarification.  With regard to reporting mechanisms or the ongoing communication between the Financial Regulator and the Irish Stock Exchange, it appears there is a weakness in the communications strategy.  Is it the case that there is potential for a positive role for the Irish Stock Exchange in strengthening the regulatory framework but that it is leaving it to the Financial Regulator to effect change?  There seems to be no formal communications network or strategy.  Will the delegation give me a sense of whether this is correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That has clarified the matter.  I asked for short selling to be put on the agenda precisely because the ban has been lifted in other jurisdictions.  I accept the explanation of the Irish Stock Exchange in this regard.  We all accept, on some level, that it is a necessary function in terms of liquidity provision.  That is a given but it is a matter of how the instrument is used in particular jurisdictions.  In our jurisdiction, it gave rise to certain questions.With regard to the disclosure regimes, Ms Somers stated:A degree of stability has returned to the markets and many regulators have withdrawn the bans that were imposed, replacing them for the most part with disclosure regimes.  However, the Irish market is unique [...].  For this reason, withdrawing the ban in a similar manner to other jurisdictions is not necessarily the correct decision for Ireland at this time.However, in Ms Somers's conclusion, she stated the replacement of the short-selling ban with a move to an Irish approach consistent with a harmonised European disclosure regime may be the correct approach.  Could a disclosure regime operating according to a pan-European rules-based approach be introduced to the Irish market?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	While no one has a crystal ball when it comes to share performance, does the Stock Exchange see any semblance of a recovery in the market?  How many companies will ride the storm, be consolidated or go to the wall?
