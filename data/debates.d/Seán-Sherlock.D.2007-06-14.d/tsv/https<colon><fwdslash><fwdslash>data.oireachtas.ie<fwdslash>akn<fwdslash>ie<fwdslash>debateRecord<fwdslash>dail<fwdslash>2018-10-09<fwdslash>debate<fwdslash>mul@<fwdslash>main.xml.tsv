SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-09T22:10:00+01:00	As I have the ear of the Minister, and thus a captive audience, I plead with him and, by extension, the Government to look at the cost of nicotine-replacement therapies, which is exorbitant and which proves to be a disincentive to moving from smoking to therapies such as inhalers, lozenges or gum. If the cost is so prohibitive it acts as a disincentive. I understand it is covered by the general medical services scheme and, on that basis, the pricing mechanism is arguably far too high. There is profiteering going on with the cost of such therapies, and I ask the Minister to look at this issue.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-09T23:50:00+01:00	Given that I only have a minute and the fact that this resolution will come into effect from 1 January 2019, I ask the Government to look at this again in the Finance Bill. It is clear there will be unintended consequences as a result of the proposed implementation of this measure. We have been contacted throughout the evening by many people from all the sectors that have been discussed tonight, ranging from restaurants to barber shops to hairdressing salons. It is clear that it will have a massive effect whether one lives in rural Ireland, a large urban conurbation or a middle sized town. Will the Government review this or is there any scope for examining it again so we can have a wider debate? The debate should not be condensed into mere minutes as it has been tonight. I accept that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, must organise the business in this way.
