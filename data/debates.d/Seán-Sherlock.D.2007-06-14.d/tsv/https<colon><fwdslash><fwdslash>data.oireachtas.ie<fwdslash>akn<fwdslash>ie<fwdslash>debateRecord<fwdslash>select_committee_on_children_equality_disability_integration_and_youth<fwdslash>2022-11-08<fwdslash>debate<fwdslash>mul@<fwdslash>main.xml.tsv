[<p eid="para_28">I beg the Chairman's forgiveness. I wish to seek clarification on amendment No. 1. Is there scope to reintroduce or revisit that issue at Report Stage?</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">Okay. I thank the Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_36">Not when there are Oxford commas, though.</p>]
[<p eid="para_88">What, in legal terms, is the definition of a "statement of fact" and what weight does it carry?</p>]
[<p eid="para_151">With this legislation, one tries try to put oneself into the position of people who find themselves being the victims of domestic violence, but one cannot possibly internalise that experience. From a practical point of view, what steps could someone who wants to take action take and will the five days within a 12-month period be sufficient to do so? For instance, if someone is seeking medical attention, that person may make multiple visits to a GP or consultant in that 12-month period. It is easy to anticipate that seeking the services of a victim support organisation would occur over quite a number of days. Psychological or professional counselling would occur over quite a number of days. Very often, such visits are made within working hours. What about relocation, either temporarily or permanently? When we start adding up all of the days that the Minister codifies in the legislation in terms of when a person can take leave for certain circumstances - for example, visiting a legal practitioner, seeking legal advice or even seeking the assistance of An Garda Síochána - I would contend that five days within a consecutive 12-month period is not enough. </p>, <p eid="para_152">I ask the Minister to please, if at all possible, revisit this on Report Stage to see if there is some scope there to allow for a greater degree of flexibility. As public representatives and Deputies who deal with these issues and who advocate on behalf of our constituents who find themselves in these circumstances to get access to the services, we know how long it takes. Deputy Cairns has just outlined this from a rural point of view in particular. I represent a broadly similar type of constituency in that regard. I am hopeful that the Minister might revisit this, if at all possible. In my experience, employers have been understanding and they allow for a greater degree of flexibility.</p>, <p eid="para_153"> My second point on that proposed new section pertains to domestic violence leave where there is a prescribed daily rate of pay. The Minister will make regulations under subsection 6 and will assess “the potential impact, including the potential for any disproportionate or other adverse impact, that the rate of domestic violence leave pay to be prescribed will have on the economy generally, specific sectors of the economy, employers or employees". To enable us to support this amendment, I am trying to get a sense from the Minister of what exactly this will mean in pounds, shillings and pence. Where is the thinking in the Department on that element of this Government amendment? Who the Minister is talking to about this? What is deemed to be a standard rate of pay? Is there thinking around that? I am not aware of what the standard would be. Who will the Minister liaise with on that? Will the Minister liaise with employers, employees’ representatives, trade unions and so on in that regard? To me, it seems to be quite vague. </p>, <p eid="para_154"> I am arguing two points, the first of which is that the five days are not enough and the second of which is that we need more detail in respect of the prescribed daily rate of pay. It would be invariably for women and let me not put a tooth in that. Women will primarily be asking me what the prescribed daily rate of pay will be. I think they are entitled to some degree of clarity around that. </p>]
[<p eid="para_172">I was going to speak to the generality of section 6 but am happy to come back in if other members want to stay on the points being raised.</p>]
[<p eid="para_176">On section 6, we put forward an amendment, which was ruled out of order, in respect of the right of an employee to seek leave without pay - it is important to stress it was without pay - from his or her employment for the purposes of obtaining services around reproductive health. We were prescriptive about it being where an employee has miscarried a child having a gestational age of 28 weeks or less or in order to receive treatment from a registered medical practitioner in the State in relation to pregnancy, childbirth or assisted human reproduction. I received a letter from the Chair stating that amendment No. 7 could impose a charge on the revenue and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 212(3).</p>]
[<p eid="para_178">Let us for the public record state that, absolutely, Chairs within the Houses of the Oireachtas find themselves in the invidious position of having to sign off on these letters when somebody somewhere deems committee amendments are disallowed because there is a charge on the Exchequer. As proposer of the amendment, nobody comes to me to say they think the amendment will impose such a charge. I cannot for the life of me see why the Labour Party amendment should be disallowed. We clearly state the entitlement is leave without pay. How could that impose a charge on the Exchequer? It cuts out a raft of debate on meaningful issues on a range of legislative proposals put forward by the Government and the Opposition. That is a philosophical point, one could argue, but I would have thought an amendment of this nature would be pertinent to the Bill. The name of the Bill is the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 and we merely sought to put in place something that would speak to thousands of women. There is an attitudinal issue, whether we like it or not, regarding reproductive health-related leave where women encounter massive opposition from a small minority of employers. I know of women who used 90% of their annual leave for IVF treatment. I know of women who described their humiliation when they sought unpaid leave after a miscarriage and were turned down by an employer who said miscarriage is common and most people just get on with it. If we can find a mechanism to legislate for that under the ambit of this legislation, we would support that, but I cannot for the life of me see why our amendment was disallowed. I appreciate what the Chair is going to say.</p>]
[<p eid="para_181">I appreciate that and thank the Chair for her latitude. Is it not an awful indictment that we receive that answer? It is an indictment of the system we operate in this country.</p>]
[<p eid="para_183">It is not the case.</p>]
[<p eid="para_185">That is a fair point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_205">Are these not premature cut-off points given the nature of society and that children have to be looked after into their teenage years as well? The numbers used are quite arbitrary.</p>]
[<p eid="para_207">Is it possible to include those ages as part of the two-year review? It would be great to hear from the Minister after two years how that period had worked. The present Minister may be <i>in situ</i> in two years' time or it may be his successor. I would not mind having an opportunity to look back at this legislation in two years' time to see how this provision worked in real terms.</p>]
[<p eid="para_239">I only want to speak to the Minister's own language where he states, in section 13B(4), "An employee's approved flexible working arrangement shall not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed 6 months continuous employment with the employer concerned." If I was to look at that from an employer's perspective, is the employer to adhere to the law, saying he or she cannot give the employee this flexible working arrangement because the six months have not elapsed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_244">I think I understand the Minister. I suppose there may be circumstances in which a kindly employer may wish to be flexible towards his or her employee and within the six months, notwithstanding that the employee is temporary or whatever the employee's status is, there may be circumstances in which an employer would say that it is within the six months, he or she would like to give the leave to the employee but he or she has looked at the legislation and it states the employer cannot. The legislation is being prescriptive by my interpretation.</p>, <p eid="para_245"> Maybe I am wrong in my interpretation. Perhaps it could be looked at again. If it is overly prescriptive and if there are circumstances where an employer wants to give an employee within the six months some flexibility, maybe there is scope to do that or else maybe I am misreading the entirety of the section.</p>]
[<p eid="para_247">I might come back to it on Report Stage. We might tease it out further, if that is okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_251">I will press it too.</p>]
[<p eid="para_293">Before we move on to section 9, can we go backwards for one second?</p>]
[<p eid="para_295">In respect of the insertion of a new section 7, there is reference to leave for medical care purposes. A question arises as to what constitutes medical care purposes. Perhaps the Minister could come back with a more detailed explanation in that regard. How liberal or strident is that interpretation? That was all I wanted to say. The Chair was moving proficiently through the Bill.</p>]
[<p eid="para_297">I am at the disposal of the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_299">The definition of leave for medical care purposes is unclear in my mind. How liberally will that be applied?</p>]
[<p eid="para_353">Is that section 5(2)-----</p>]
