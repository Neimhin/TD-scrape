SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-07-10T09:40:00+01:00	Is Sinn Féin now proposing that the corporation tax rate is too low? Is that the inference of the Deputy's question when he says we have a bargain basement corporation tax rate? I do not accept the Deputy's inference that US foreign investment in the economy is at an undesirable level. The activities of US owned companies represent an important source of exports and employment. They are spread across 500 companies in a wide range of sectors and have strong links with the economy. Exports from foreign owned enterprises are an important and sustainable element of the economy, as they are in other small globalised economies. While IDA Ireland client companies play an important part in the economy, it should be remembered that employment in such companies represents less than 9% of total Irish employment. The majority of employment comes from the activities of Irish owned companies and enterprises and these are the key focus of much of our enterprise policy. Many of the proposals developed in An Action Plan for Jobs have been designed to assist the start-up, scaling and internationalisation of Irish owned enterprises. Measures include the roll-out of the local enterprise office, LEO, network, the establishment of the potential exporters divisions, the increase in staff assisting Irish companies to develop in overseas markets, the increase in the number of trade missions, the creation of new instruments to facilitate access to finance and the development of sectoral strategies in areas such as tourism, software and food. There is solid progress being made. Exports by Enterprise Ireland companies are up by €3.5 billion in the past three years, while employment has grown by 14%, from 146,419 to 166,184 higher than the total employed in IDA Ireland client companies.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T09:40:00+01:00	If the Deputy thinks the effective corporation tax rate is too low, he should tell us what his party thinks it should be, rather than merely express it as a platitude.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T09:40:00+01:00	Enterprise Ireland client companies have continued to generate increased jobs growth. They recorded the highest overall rise in employment levels in the past decade, with 5,442 net new jobs, some 3,620 of which were full time, at the end of 2013. Moreover, they provide employment for 175,750 persons, comprising 149,718 full-time and 26,032 part-time workers. We recorded export sales of €17.1 billion in 2013 and have set a target of €17.5 billion for Enterprise Ireland supported companies for 2014. There are 100,000 persons employed in 500 US companies here and we export goods and services worth €26 billion to the US market. Total trade between Ireland and the United States - the question relates to the US market - amounts to approximately €55 billion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T09:40:00+01:00	Enterprise Ireland's network of international offices now extends to 30. We opened two new offices during 2013, in Istanbul and Austin, Texas. Some 815 new overseas customers were secured for client companies, 38% of which were in high growth markets. In addition, 111 of Enterprise Ireland's high potential start-up companies secured their first new international reference company in 2013. There were 18 Minister-led overseas trade missions, in which more than 1,000 Enterprise Ireland client companies took part, and a further 67 international events in major target markets. We are making significant progress. There is a strong policy prerogative, since the creation of the LEOs, to support the SME sector at a local level and ensure those companies that have export potential through Enterprise Ireland will be supported. There is a broad range of supports available. I reiterate that there was €65 million in equity and venture capital, a figure of €92 million for technology and scientific infrastructure, €27 million for capability building and €19 million in capital for employment support and capacity expansion. This is taxpayers' money being invested effectively through Enterprise Ireland to support the indigenous sector.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:20:00+01:00	In the past decade the influence of the Internet on the economy has been growing steadily, about which there is no doubt. In 2013 Indecon Consultants estimated that digitalrelated activities contributed 4.4% of GDP to the economy. The consultants predicted that this contribution would increase by 16% year on year. Almost 95,000 jobs are already supported by digital-related activities in the economy. Notwithstanding this trend, CSO data suggest only 23% of small companies in Ireland are engaged in sales through e-commerce. The proportion is considered to be even lower for companies with fewer than ten employees. These companies are potentially losing valuable sales opportunities in both the Irish market and in selling overseas. It is estimated that Irish consumers spend just under €6 billion online annually, of which 60% to 70% goes overseas.  Encouraging more indigenous companies to engage in e-commerce is, therefore, a key objective of the Government’s national digital strategy and An Action Plan for Jobs. The 2014 action plan includes a commitment to roll out a trading online voucher scheme to 2,000 micro and small businesses by the end of 2015. The scheme is intended as a catalyst to support businesses to start trading online or improve their current online trading offering, rather than simply having an online presence and there is a qualitative difference. It provides successful applicants with a voucher up to the value of €2,500 to help meet these objectives. The value of the voucher must be matched by the applicant company. The trading online voucher scheme falls within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. However, the vouchers will be administered by the local enterprise offices. Following a piloting of the scheme by the Dublin City Enterprise Office at the start of the year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced the national roll-out of the scheme last week. Applicant businesses will be selected on the basis of their project plan, including their expected growth in jobs and exports as a result of trading online.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:20:00+01:00	There is strong recognition by the Government of the size of the spend and its impact on GDP. The advent of the online trading vouchers through the local enterprise offices, LEOs, is a concrete policy intervention in recognising this trend and providing funding towards supporting businesses. On the eligibility criteria, the vouchers will be available to a maximum figure of €2,500. Approval must be obtained prior to incurring any expense and third party costs only will be considered. All third party supplier invoices must contain proper business details. This is a robust document that greatly encourages businesses that may have had an online presence but which were not trading online. It will be for the LEOs to advertise locally to ensure businesses will come into them.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:20:00+01:00	The important point is that we have recognised the potential value and created a solution through the roll-out of the trading online voucher scheme. In terms of the early results under the pilot scheme, seven out of ten companies stated the voucher application process had already helped them to determine how online trading would fit into their businesses. Some 70% of the companies involved in the pilot scheme in Dublin had received more customer inquiries, while 55% had had more sales. There is a provision within the LEO infrastructure to allow those companies that wish to trade online do so and we are already seeing a positive impact. It is impossible to give the exact figure for how much the State will spend in supporting this activity, but there is a provision available and it has been rolled out across the State in the piloting of the scheme. The demand from small local businesses to participate has been extremely high. It will take us a little time to have data on the numbers of businesses that have come in and how this has had an impact on their businesses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:40:00+01:00	Is the Deputy speaking from experience there?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:40:00+01:00	During the Irish Presidency in June 2013, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, secured the agreement of all trade ministers in the EU Council, to formally open negotiations with the US on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  At a time of high unemployment we must grasp every opportunity that adds to the momentum of recovery that Government policies are achieving. In particular, huge potential is offered by TTIP to accelerate economic growth, and expand trade and export opportunities. These give us the potential to create more jobs so that the already falling unemployment rate can be more quickly reduced. Ireland has particularly strong economic links with the US, with over 100,000 people employed in 500 US companies here and with Irish companies exporting over €1 billion in goods and services to the US every year. If we add in exports from foreign companies located here, over €26 billion in goods and services are sold to the high value US market. This gives a clear indicator of the opportunities we can leverage from fewer barriers to transatlantic trade. The Department recently engaged Copenhagen Economics to examine the economic and other impacts of TTIP and related potential opportunities. Some tentative and preliminary findings suggest that the impact on our economy might be as large as an additional 1.1% increase in GDP. This is higher than the estimated 0.5% GDP gain from TTIP for the EU as a whole. In employment terms, this could lead to an additional 8,000 jobs for Ireland over the agreement’s implementation period. However, considerable further analysis needs to be done by the consultants to clarify what the impact of TTIP will be. In terms of employment, benefits are likely to accrue, particularly to sectors such as life sciences, ICT, food and manufacturing. These include a large number of SMEs. I hope these would gain disproportionately because the type of barriers that TTIP aims to tackle, are more costly for small companies to deal with.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T10:40:00+01:00	We are looking at this from the point of view of the upsides and are not viewing it from the point of view of the downsides. We will do a proper analysis, but it is being undertaken with a view to an economic win.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-07-10T16:40:00+01:00	To be helpful, as the Minister dealing with the first matter has not arrived, I suggest we take the second matter first.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T16:50:00+01:00	I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this matter. Both Deputy Stanton and I are playing as a tag team in respect of this issue because it is pertinent to our constituency. The area referred to has been identified by my Department as one of the areas where due to demographic changes it is projected that there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. I think Deputy Stanton first identified the precipice that has been reached in respect of those demographic issues in the first instance. Since that time, we have been working together to get these projects over the line. We have had success particularly in respect of Midleton and the Gaelscoil at Mainistir na Corann. Building projects for five primary schools, one of which involves the amalgamation of two existing schools referred to by Deputy Stanton, are proposed for the Midleton and Carrigtwohill areas to meet demographic growth. Scoil Chlochair Mhuire and Scoil Mhuire Naofa are existing boys' and girls' primary schools currently operating on separate sites in a combination of temporary and permanent accommodation. A project to deliver a new 32-classroom primary school building in Carrigtwohill is planned to facilitate the amalgamation and expansion of these two schools, as Deputy Stanton has outlined. The Department has approved additional temporary accommodation for both of these schools to meet their interim needs for September 2014. In addition to this particular building project, a further four building projects are proposed that involve three primary schools and one post-primary school in order to meet demographic growth in the area. There will be a new 16-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Midleton Educate Together national school, Midleton. The site acquisition is ongoing at present. I have already referred to the new 24-classroom school building to replace an existing temporary school building for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann. This is going through the rapid planning process as we speak. The Deputy has also referred to the possible need for another primary school because of the demographic challenges. In that regard, a new 16-classroom primary school with patronage to be decided will be built and a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school is due to be established under the patronage of Cork ETB involving the Catholic Bishop of Cloyne.  The Department, with the assistance of Cork County Council, has identified and is currently engaged in the site acquisition process for the primary and post-primary school projects in Carrigtwohill referred to by the Deputy. Once sites are acquired, the school projects concerned will be progressed immediately through the architectural planning process. I want to assure the people of this area and Deputy Stanton that I as a Minister of State in that Department am personally overseeing those projects. The Deputy and I have discussed the commercial sensitivities around specific sites. Given that we have had some success so far in respect of Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann, an issue that went on into its second decade, and the fact that the planning process has now started, I am confident we will continue to give this top priority in respect of Carrigtwohill. I can assure the Deputy and the people of that area that we are working on this on a daily basis and we will continue to work, if I dare say it, as a tag team on the Government side of this House to deliver these necessary projects.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T16:50:00+01:00	I understand that the site notice is up for Gaelscoil Mhainistir na Corann. I think that was the project referred to by Deputy Stanton.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T16:50:00+01:00	The Deputy and I have been through the process of teasing out the site acquisition. I suppose that it is one of the flaws in the system, notwithstanding the fact that there is a memorandum of understanding with the local authority, when one is seeking to acquire privately owned land and there is a market value on the land. There is an inherent challenge there because of the constitutional right to private property and the market value inherent therein. On top of that, if there is a number of sites that have been designated, there are certain commercial sensitivities around that. I am confident that because we have been through the Gaelscoil Midleton process together, the same energy is being applied to the challenge in Carrigtwohill. I am confident that once the site is acquired, we can move rapidly. If I retain my position or indeed regardless of my position, I will continue to advocate with the Deputy on ensuring that we can move rapidly to getting these schools built. I cannot give the Deputy a definitive timeframe at this point but both he and the people in that area should be assured of our commitment to ensuring that we deliver within the five-year planning programme. That is the aim.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T17:10:00+01:00	It is ominous that she sent me here to reply.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T17:10:00+01:00	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. As the Deputy said, we acknowledge the crucial role carers play in society. In 2014 the estimated Department expenditure on various supports for carers will be almost €886 million, comprising approximately €557 million on the carer's allowance, €21.5 million on carer's benefit, €122 million on the respite care grant and €105.1 million on domiciliary care allowance. I welcome the opportunity to highlight one of these key supports for carers provided by the Department, namely, the respite care grant. The grant was introduced in June 1999, at which time the Department of Health also paid a respite care grant to people receiving domiciliary care allowance who were not in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit from the Department of Social Protection. The domiciliary care allowance scheme transferred to the Department of Social Protection in 2009 as did responsibility for the related respite care grant. In 2005 the stand-alone respite care grant was introduced for all full-time carers. All respite care grants are now administered by the Department. Although the grant is not subject to a means test, applicants are not eligible for the grant if they are working more than 15 hours per week outside the home, if they are getting a jobseeker's payment or if they are signing on for credits. There is no obligation on carers to use the respite care grant to access respite services. The value of the grant stands at €1,375 and this year it is estimated that the grant will be paid to some 87,000 persons at a cost of €122 million. A person caring for more than one person receives a grant for each person for whom they care. The grant is paid on the first Thursday in June of the relevant year to cover 52 weeks from this date. As it is an advance payment, the type of circumstance to which the Deputy referred is already covered. The grant is not paid on a proportional basis and in order to qualify a person must, in addition to other criteria, be caring for at least six months. The mid-year June payment date allows carers to avail of respite over the summer months, facilitates the administration of the grant and ensures that the grant is targeted at those providing full-time care over a significant period of time. In a review of the grant undertaken by the Department in recent years, carers were asked about their preference regarding payment. The options of splitting the grant into two or three payments through the year were put to people and the vast majority of respondents, 84%, indicated that they would prefer no change to the current arrangements. This view was prevalent irrespective of age group, social welfare status, gender, location, number of care recipients or marital status. In favouring the current annual payment, people expressed the view that a large lump sum would be more likely to be used for a specific purpose, such as a holiday, whereas smaller sums paid more frequently would be more likely to be absorbed in the day-to-day expenses of the household. In general, respondents stated that they were very pleased to receive the grant and that it was very helpful to them in easing the financial stress they had been experiencing. Those who used the grant for a holiday generally felt that the break would not have been possible without the grant. People who use the grant for other purposes, particularly to pay regular household bills, considered that the grant eased their financial worries generally.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-10T17:10:00+01:00	There is a recognition of the work carers do, which is part of the Irish psyche and the intergenerational solidarity that exists here. I do not know if the Government will increase the payment because we are not in a position, regarding the budget arithmetic, to ascertain whether there is scope to do so.
