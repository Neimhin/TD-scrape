[<p eid="para_9">I thank the witnesses for coming in. There are the usual provisos in respect of mobile phones. I will just turn my own to airplane mode.</p>, <p eid="para_10"> I propose we go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters before returning to public session. </p>]
[<p eid="para_11">The next item on the agenda is engagement with officials from the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>, <p eid="para_12"> Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and persons in the Public Gallery to switch their phones to airplane mode please. </p>, <p eid="para_13"> I welcome, from the State Examinations Commission, Mr. Aidan Farrell, chief executive officer and Dr. Tim Desmond, acting head of the examinations and assessment division. Ms Rita Sexton, assistant principal officer, is from the Department of Education and Skills. I thank them for appearing before us. </p>, <p eid="para_14"> The witnesses have been invited here today to discuss petition No. P000013/17 from Ms Tara O'Sullivan on how to make the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding 30 extra minutes. Ms O'Sullivan is requesting that the Department of Education look at the possibility of extending the length of time of the English paper for the junior certificate by 30 minutes to allow students enough time to complete the paper.</p>, <p eid="para_15"> Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to read the following. By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p>, <p eid="para_16"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p>, <p eid="para_17"> I remind our guests, as we indicated in the committee's invitation, the presentation should be no more than five to ten minutes duration. I am proposing that, rather than read out the submission verbatim, because all of the members have received the submission, if the witnesses were in a position to summarise it in five minutes or so then we can have a question and answer session on the nature of the submission. If that is okay, I will call Mr. Farrell to open the proceedings. </p>]
[<p eid="para_26">I understand that approximately 60,000 people completed the examination.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">Plus four individual complaints were made about time constraints.</p>]
[<p eid="para_30">Was there a geographical spread in terms of the four complaints? Did they come from one entity?</p>]
[<p eid="para_32">Mr. Farrell's colleagues can also respond to my queries.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">It is reasonable to presume that if there were only four complaints from various parts of the country then the vast bulk of the 60,000 people who participated in the examination were satisfied with the two hour allocation. I do not mean to put words into anybody's mouth here. I just want to get a sense of the matter from the witnesses.</p>]
[<p eid="para_39">Some of us are under time constraints today and I apologise to the witnesses. Time is always a big issue here. I know the committee has sent correspondence to the witnesses about other issues as well but I want to open up the debate to other members. I call on Senator Kelleher to commence.</p>]
[<p eid="para_48">For clarification, is that under the statement of strategy?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">Deputy Eugene Murphy wishes to intervene but with regard to your point about content, one of the issues we highlighted related to the role of Parliament and parliamentary committees. We perceive that there is a phasing out of that knowledge, as it were, at junior cycle level. I am relying on my notes but with the new well-being programme the current civic, social and political education, CSPE, is being phased out under the junior cycle reform programme. Where lies the ability of students to glean knowledge on the role of Parliament and parliamentary committees, for example?</p>]
[<p eid="para_65">The complaint desks did not receive 11,000 calls.</p>]
[<p eid="para_68">To be fair, given the degree of parent and pupil power we have these days and given that 11,000 people signed the petition, I expect people know their rights.</p>]
[<p eid="para_70">It is a fair question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_78">I thank Mr. Farrell very much for that comprehensive response. Do members have any further questions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_80">There has to be some deconstruction of the thinking that existed heretofore where everything was geared towards the terminal exam. It is quite a struggle for many schools to try to deconstruct the pedagogical element and the content aspect of this. Where a school was geared towards trying to squeeze as much as possible in to the terminal exam, it was in the confined space of time because they were getting the desired points or desired results for the onward trajectory towards third level institutions and so on. The previous junior cycle was part of that trajectory or continuum. Maybe some schools continue to struggle in this regard. I do not refer specifically to Loreto College, which generated this petition, but maybe some challenges remain in the system around trying to deconstruct some of that thinking. This gives voice to petitions of this nature, and I speak in general terms.</p>, <p eid="para_81"> The committee has heard absolutely compelling evidence here today. By any reasonable or objective analysis, the witnesses have given a very robust account of the nature of the correspondence entered into with the petitioners and have engaged willingly and openly with the petitioners. The witnesses have answered all of the questions on the time challenge. The research and qualitative analysis carried out clearly shows that the time was not such an issue as it related to last year's English exam and that people were able to get to the questions in a timely fashion. I believe the committee members are in agreement with that analysis.</p>, <p eid="para_82"> The procedures in place for individual students to interface with the State Examinations Commission are robust; in this instance in this exam, there were only four people in the State who made a complaint about the time element out of 60,000 students who sat the same exam - and protecting their anonymity I assume they were not four individuals from one school and that they represent a wider geographical spread. The vast majority of students who took the exam were satisfied about the time constraints under which they were operating. I believe this to be a fair assessment.</p>, <p eid="para_83"> Having regard to the evidence submitted to the committee by the State Examinations Commission and the Department of Education and Skills the committee deems it appropriate to close the petition and to send a copy of the submission made by the State Examinations Commission and the Department to the petitioners. The committee will thank the petitioners for their engagement with the committee. On behalf of the committee members, I express my gratitude to the witnesses for coming before the committee today. We strayed in to other areas also, but it was very useful to engage with the witnesses because it is helpful to members, as parliamentarians, to understand the dynamics of the State Examinations Commission and the Department on the exam structures. It was a useful tutorial for us and we are grateful for it. I thank the officials for coming before us today and for engaging with the committee.</p>]
