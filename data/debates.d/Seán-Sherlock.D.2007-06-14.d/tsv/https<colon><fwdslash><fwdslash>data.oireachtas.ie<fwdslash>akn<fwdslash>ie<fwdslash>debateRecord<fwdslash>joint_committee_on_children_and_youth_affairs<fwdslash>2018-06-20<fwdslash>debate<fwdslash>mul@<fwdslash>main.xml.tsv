SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Before Tusla came here today, did it engage the services of a public relations firm or consultancy to assist it in the preparation of a question-and-answer session?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Is Tusla engaging the services of a PR firm or consultancy in respect of its work?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Who is Tusla engaging the services of?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	What does communications strategy cover?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Does it involve preparation work for hearings before Oireachtas committees, for example?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	That is a straight question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Is it correct then that Mr. McBride did have preparations with Q4 in respect of his interaction with the committee today?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Mr. Gibson is shaking his head and Mr. McBride is saying "Yes". Which is it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	It is Q4.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	How much is Tusla is paying Q4 for the engagement of such services?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	I need an answer.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Does Mr. McBride acknowledge that this is taxpayers' money? We need a full breakdown of these costs being incurred by the taxpayer for the consultancy services Tusla has procured for preparation for events such as this one. Will Tusla explain in ten seconds or less if the Signs of Safety programme is dependent on assurances and commitments given by families themselves regarding their interaction with Tusla? How can Tusla be sure the programme works in real terms?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	If a child is at risk, particularly in a sexual abuse case, who is Tusla relying on for communications? Is it the child or the adults within that relationship?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	I did not understand what Dr. Gillen meant by being loaded through the front door and more senior social workers are at the front door. What does that mean?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Mr. McBride said there were 53,000 referrals last year.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Does that mean all senior staff are at the front door------
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	Hold on. I will finish my question. Does that mean all senior staff are involved in ensuring there is absolute capture? Yesterday's Irish Examiner states:Tusla failed to address 65 abuse cases despite concerns children were still at “potential risk”;Tusla closed 164 suspected child sexual abuse cases despite not knowing if the matters were resolved.How can anyone watching these proceedings be reassured when Mr. McBride is telling us that Tusla does not have enough staff, that there is a massive rate of attrition and that there is only a small cohort of senior staff which is not increasing to any great extent? How can the witnesses assure us that when cases are presented at the so-called front door of Tusla they will be filtered, assessed for risk and managed properly? Tusla got an additional €40 million last year and its overall resources for 2018 amount to approximately €753 million. The organisation is in receipt of three quarters of a billion in taxpayers' money, yet HIQA reports are showing utterly disgraceful failures on the part of Tusla. Are the witnesses not ashamed of the fact that this situation pertains? I direct that last question to Mr. McBride, as head of the organisation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	Is that a high priority case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	Page 46 of the report notes a 72% reduction in high priority open cases awaiting allocation. Where is the filtration process and who decides what is high priority? Clearly, in 65 of those cases, notwithstanding injunctions and so forth, delays occurred. That is the fact of the matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	Tusla closed 164 suspected child-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	I wish to raise two other issues which may have been dealt with in my absence. I had to go to the Dáil Chamber earlier so if this has already been answered, I apologise. How do the witnesses explain the fact that supervisors do not have the appropriate training in managing child sexual abuse cases, including retrospective allegations? Were the witnesses aware of this and, if so, how can they stand over it? I also remind the witnesses that I want an answer to the question I posed on quarter 4. My final question is on CARI, an organisation with which Tusla interacts. I have relatives living in the Munster area who are waiting for an appointment with CARI for their child. The child is in a state of turmoil but I will not go into the details here. Why have I not been able to get an answer as to the reason that child is still awaiting an appointment?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	That is not an answer.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	Hold on one second. That is not an answer. The question-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	I am getting a bit exercised because the witness is playing down the clock.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	There are children out there who have been sexually abused who are awaiting appointments and as of now, they have not been able to get them with organisations such as CARI with which Tusla has service level agreements or for which it is responsible. I want a straight answer.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	Will the child to whom I referred be able to get an appointment within a reasonable timeframe?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:00:00+01:00	The question on quarter 4 is a straight one.I have asked about services-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-20T16:10:00+01:00	I want to know how much. Forgive me but I addressed a question to Dr. Gillen in respect of the point she made about the front door.
