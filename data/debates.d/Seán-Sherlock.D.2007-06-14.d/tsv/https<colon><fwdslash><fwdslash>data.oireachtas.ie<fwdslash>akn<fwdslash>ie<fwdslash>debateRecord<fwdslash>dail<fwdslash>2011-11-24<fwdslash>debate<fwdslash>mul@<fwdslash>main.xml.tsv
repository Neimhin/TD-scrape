[<p eid="para_1839">While the areas around which public R&amp;D budgets have been oriented to date (ICT, biotechnology, aspects of energy policy) were appropriate for building a broad base of national expertise in fundamental, underpinning science and technology we now need to leverage the strengths that have emerged from the investment that has taken place.  We need to target investment so that we have critical mass in areas that link more precisely to sustaining or growing jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_1840">The recommendations of the independently constituted Research Prioritisation Steering Group, chaired by Jim O'Hara, former General Manager, Intel Ireland, will be key in implementing efficiency and effectiveness in our system of public investment in R&amp;D, and this will be complemented by other initiatives, notably the forthcoming legislation to extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland to enable it to fund applied research.</p>, <p eid="para_1841">The report of the Research Prioritisation Group has been completed and submitted to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and myself and will shortly be brought to Government for consideration.  Future focus of investment on the priority areas identified will require greater cohesion of funding across Departments and agencies.  Achieving this cohesion is likely to be more impactful than a single funding stream per se.</p>]
