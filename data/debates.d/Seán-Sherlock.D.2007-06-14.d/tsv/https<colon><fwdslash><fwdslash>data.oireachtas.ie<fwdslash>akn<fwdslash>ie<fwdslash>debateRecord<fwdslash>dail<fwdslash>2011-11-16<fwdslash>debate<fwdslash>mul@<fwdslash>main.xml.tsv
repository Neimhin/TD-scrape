[<p eid="para_889">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 48 together.</p>, <p eid="para_890">The key recommendations in the report, including bonus points for higher level mathematics, professional development for teachers and the roll-out of Project Maths, are being progressed.  Bonus points will be implemented from 2012.  Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 project schools which started the programme in 2008.  This is being supported by extensive investment in professional development for teachers which began in 2009 and which will continue until 2013 at least.  As part of this, intensive postgraduate courses will be developed aimed at teachers who do not hold a major qualification in mathematics.  A Project Maths implementation support group, an industry and education partnership, reported in 2010 on how stakeholders from business, second level and higher education can work together to achieve the objectives of Project Maths.  The recommendations of this report are being progressed.  My Department has also published the national literacy and numeracy strategy, which is designed to promote a significant improvement in mathematical skills throughout primary and second level schools.</p>]
[<p eid="para_892">One of the main recommendations related to bonus points.  From next year there will be 25 bonus points for mathematics.  There will also be a system of continuing professional development of teachers at primary and secondary level in the teaching of mathematics, including a professional masters degree and a part-time higher education diploma in mathematical education.  Consideration has been given to a four-year honours degree in mathematical education and, in addition, a tender for a postgraduate programme in mathematics will be finalised shortly, aimed at teachers who need extra support.</p>, <p eid="para_893">A report was produced by National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MSDL, a function of the University of Limerick.  It has carried out a good deal of work in this area and it is to be commended on the report completed under the tutelage of Dr. John O'Donoghue on the out-of-field teaching in post-primary education.  Project Maths is dealing with this in terms of continuing professional development.  The incentive of the 25 bonus points in the Central Applications Office, CAO, is being introduced in 2012 and it should have a positive bearing.  The fact that there will be continuous benchmarking and evaluation against the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results will be a true testament of whether we are getting results.</p>, <p eid="para_894">There has been significant buy-in by teachers, parents and schools and the new junior cycle curriculum will feed in to greater outputs because the short courses devised as part of that will give students a greater chance to interact with industry.  For example, areas such as software programming, the pharmaceutical area and a host of other possibilities will engage their brains more laterally with mathematics and problem solving.  We must ensure that there is a good coterie of people who can think critically and laterally and who can solve problems in a more effectual way, the end result being better outcomes.  This is not to criticise the existing structures in place but we must continue to evolve mathematics learning in this country.</p>]
[<p eid="para_8992">Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) typically makes research grants awards that are multi-annual in nature, typically spanning a three to five year period.</p>, <p eid="para_8993">The following table sets out the researcher numbers directly supported by SFI since 2006.</p>, <p eid="para_8994">Year</p>, <p eid="para_8995">2006</p>, <p eid="para_8996">2007</p>, <p eid="para_8997">2008</p>, <p eid="para_8998">2009</p>, <p eid="para_8999">2010</p>, <p eid="para_9000">2011</p>, <p eid="para_9001">No. of Researchers</p>, <p eid="para_9002">1,362</p>, <p eid="para_9003">1,909</p>, <p eid="para_9004">2,812</p>, <p eid="para_9005">3,225</p>, <p eid="para_9006">2,999</p>, <p eid="para_9007">c.3,000</p>, <p eid="para_9008">Due to the wide range of variables that impact upon the overall numbers of researchers being directly supported by SFI in-year it is not possible to provide exact projections of the numbers of researchers that will be supported under SFI funding.
