[<p eid="para_87">Given that what the Minister has outlined represents a short-term response, will he indicate whether a long-term response has been discussed?  I ask this question in the context of the announcement by Dairygold, one of the main processors in Munster, that it has had to reduce milk prices by 17.4 cent per litre in the last 12 months.  The price is currently bottoming out at some 20 cent per litre.  The intervention mechanisms to which the Minister referred, such as aid to private storage and export funds, will have a short-term effect in terms of improving price.  Has there been any political discussion on the overall quota regime?</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">Why has the Minister entirely ruled out revisiting the health check?  As he said, we are under quota.  In the current global economic environment, the demand for dairy-based products is reducing significantly over time.  Has there been any political analysis of how that will pan out?  Given our emphasis on milk-based production, there will be serious implications for the agriculture sector if there is no improvement in global demand.  There will be little choice but to revisit the health check because it will have serious implications for how we produce dairy-based products into the future.  I do not see how such a review can be ruled out emphatically without some degree of debate and analysis of where we are going.</p>]
[<p eid="para_184">In terms of the market for both products and the derivation of by-products from willow and miscanthus, has the Department undertaken a study in regard to market viability?  Also, does the Minister of State envisage this scheme to be a long term sustainable scheme, sustainable in the sense of it being maintained as a scheme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_195">I am concerned that the suckler cow welfare scheme may be abolished or further eroded.  That was the basis of my decision to table this question.  Over 32,000 beef farmers have participated in the Teagasc training sessions that are required under the scheme.  It is vitally important that the scheme be maintained in the first instance.  The answer given by the Minister will not reassure the House.  Will the scheme be maintained?  If so, farmers are entitled to know the level at which it will be maintained.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a statement on the budgetary position ahead of 7 April next.  However, farmers are entitled to know whether the scheme will be maintained.</p>]
