[<p eid="para_384">I want to ask the Minister what was the nature of her discussions with Scouting Ireland last week. We in this House demand transparency. I believe the Minister to be transparent in her dealings with all matters under the remit of her Department. For our own part, we have yet to ascertain what is in the details of the Elliott report. I am very anxious to hear from Mr. Ian Elliott as somebody who everybody across the divide would respect in terms of previous work he has done. I want to hear the Minister's perspective on the nature and content of the meeting that took place last week.</p>]
[<p eid="para_392">Do I take it then that the Minister has full confidence in the process that is under way within Scouting Ireland in regard to its governance and historical cases? Furthermore, will the Minister confirm, as per her assertion when myself and Deputy Rabbitte raised this in the House the week before last, that there are no further cases being dealt with in a historical context? My understanding is that the Minister informed this House that she had received calls to her office about the potential for further cases. Is that still the case? Is there only one sample case at play here or are there other complaints?</p>, <p eid="para_393"> Is the Minister willing to again acknowledge the vital role thousands of volunteers play throughout the island of Ireland in everyday scouting activities, that they are utterly sacrosanct in terms of maintaining child protection policies and procedures and that there is no blemish whatsoever on ordinary members of the scouts throughout this island and that it is important that we reiterate that in this House?</p>]
[<p eid="para_397">The Minister will forgive me but I must have missed something in the dispatches. It is news to me that Jillian van Turnhout was appointed by the Minister. I must have missed the press release on that one. As a former Senator, I think we all have confidence in the fact that she has been appointed to that role. Does the Minister envisage that the Elliot report will be published? When will the Minister restore funding? It is vital, notwithstanding the process that is under way, to restore funding and have a direction of travel to restore that funding. It is an entity that represents thousands of volunteers.</p>, <p eid="para_398"> I am still unclear in my own mind - that is why I cannot wait to have an interrogation of Scouting Ireland's internal procedures - as to how the funding flows down into individual troops. There seems to be a disparity between what happens at the head of the organisation and at the bottom of the organisation. There seems to be a gap between ordinary members and those within the upper echelons of the organisation. I welcome the appointment of Jillian van Turnhout but merely want to ask the Minister that question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_400">It was tacked on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_402">With all due respect, the Minister tacked it on in the second or third reply to a question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_405">Fair enough.</p>]
