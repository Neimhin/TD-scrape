SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I join previous speakers in wishing Mr. Walshe well in his future endeavours and I congratulate him on his very good tenure as president of the IFA.  Mr. Walshe enjoyed the respect of those he represents but he also enjoys the respect of people outside the sector.  When the dioxin scare occurred last Christmas, he showed his true mettle.  Many people outside the sector are of the view that his response to that major crisis was measured and positive.I am sure Mr. Burns will correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that complete traceability applies in respect of the national sheep identification system.  I am of the opinion that the necessity to electronically tag animals means we have seen the advent of a surreal level of bureaucracy.  It is complete and utter madness.  When it comes to the traceability of animals, Ireland is way ahead of every other country in the European Union and, arguably, in the world.  I do not understand why we would impose a new system on producers.  Given that the existing system is working properly, there is no need for a new one.Mr. Burns stated that the matter is with the European Parliament.  Did the concept of introducing a new system emerge on foot of a Commission proposal?  If the answer is "Yes", will the European Parliament vote on that proposal?  Will the matter be dealt with under the new co-decision procedure as it relates to agriculture?  If it does come under that procedure, then Irish MEPs will have a significant say in how the proposal will proceed.  Some people have stated that it is a done deal.  I know I can speak for Alan Kelly, MEP, in stating that this proposal will be opposed if it is returned to the European Parliament or that the derogation that is being called for will be supported.  I say this on the basis that a common-sense approach must be adopted.  This new system is completely unnecessary.I take on board what Mr. Burns stated.  The committee should adopt a strong position on the matter.  I will be communicating with our political representatives in Brussels in respect of it.  If there is scope for a derogation, I hope there will be cross-party support for it.  I am amazed that the EU Commission would seek to impose such a measure when the sector in this country is beginning to emerge from the trough it is in.  We must do all we can to try to support the case being made.
