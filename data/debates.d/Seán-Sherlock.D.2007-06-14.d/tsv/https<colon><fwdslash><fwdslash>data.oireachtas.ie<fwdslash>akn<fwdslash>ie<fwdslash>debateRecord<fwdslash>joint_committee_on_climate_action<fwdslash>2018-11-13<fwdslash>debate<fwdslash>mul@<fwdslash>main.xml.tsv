[<p eid="para_222">I am glad to hear Mr. Donnellan use the language of the just transition and that there have been 11 town hall meetings on a voluntary redundancy programme. What will be the cost of the programme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_225">I am sure the Chairman will add the time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_227">When will the company conclude the negotiations? If it does not have an answer to that today, it could perhaps provide a note on the process. If we are reflecting the views of the Citizens' Assembly, it had a clear majority in favour of looking after workers in this process. It is clear from the language that it is the company's intention to do so, but it would be useful to add detail. Even a note providing more detail would be welcome. This is a front-line sector in which we face job losses to mitigate the effects of climate change. As such, we are conscious of the need to ensure workers are protected. I would like a note on how the process is being managed, what the end game is, when it is hoped to conclude it and what the projected outcomes are. How many hectares will be deemed to be usable as carbon sinks at the end of the process? I listened with interest to Mr. Shier earlier on some of the challenges in that regard and it would be useful for the committee to have a more detailed note on the potential for carbon sinks. It would help us in the preparation of a final report reflecting the views of the Citizens' Assembly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_233">I know, but I have asked a very specific question on Bord na MÃ³na and it would be useful.</p>]
[<p eid="para_235">I do not expect an answer today but I also ask for a note setting out what the electricity exchange Dedicated Activity Company, DAC, investment is about. While it seems self-explanatory on the face of it, a more detailed note would be useful for the committee.</p>]
