[<p eid="para_130">Thus far this has been a very useful exercise for us in terms of the degree of enlightenment on the dynamics at play <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the customs union, tariffs, the tax code and so on. However, we need to look at the matter in the context of the ongoing political discussions which are an iterative process, notwithstanding the rhetoric and the fact that there is a general election under way in the United Kingdom. This is a very useful exercise for us, particularly in gleaning the level of readiness of individual businesses or sectors for Brexit. Following on from the submissions made by Mr. Keegan and Ms Lynch, it appears that the level of readiness is poor. Ms Lynch has said 4% of Irish companies have sought external advice and support in meeting the implications of Brexit and that only one in 20 firms has a plan in place to deal with a potential customs border with the North following Brexit. Is it possible for businesses to do more? We do not yet know what the final outcome of the political negotiations will be and so there are all sorts of scenario in that regard. For example, there could be a hard Brexit, for which every business has to prepare, but we could also have a political solution, comprising outcomes of a lesser degree, including European economic area status and so on. I am trying to get a sense of what businesses need to do to be more ready. Is there more State organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Revenue, Departments and local enterprise offices, LEOs, could do? In other words, is there more that needs to be done from the State's point of view to assist businesses to be ready for what is inevitable?</p>]

[<p eid="para_135">I want to look at the challenges and opportunities. On the point that only 4% of Irish companies have sought external advice, what methodology was used to glean that information? What was the survey range and so on?</p>]
[<p eid="para_137">Can Ms Lynch give me a sense of the sectors in which the companies in question are operating?</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">I am just trying to understand the online shopping dynamic. Mr. Cody referred to the postman coming to the door. Again, are we talking in theoretical terms pending the outcome of a final political negotiation? Until that is determined, the position is effectively the <i>status quo</i>. I will put it another way. Reading between the lines of the Revenue Commissioners' submission, I believe it provides us with some sort of framework of understanding regarding the challenges that present themselves. However, the Revenue Commissioners' planning, as Mr. Cody said, "is based on the full range of possibilities, including the possibility that customs controls or processes will apply between Ireland and the UK". Has Mr. Cody given us an insight into the full range of possibilities right down to the individual consumer? Are the Revenue Commissioners scenario-planning for the individual consumer, to go back to the postman knocking at the door, right up to the multinational company? That is what we want to get a sense of from today's engagement.</p>]
[<p eid="para_142">However, a transitional arrangement would presumably be put in place post-2019, would it not?</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">I just wish to be clear about that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_146">If I, for instance, have an eBay shop and am an online trader operating out of Cork, for the sake of argument, or anywhere else in Ireland, does Mr. Cody anticipate that I would have to get authorised economic operator, AEO, status, or am I misunderstanding the mechanism by which AEOs operate? Mr. Cody says there will have to be an increase in the number of AEOs. Would I be subject to this? More and more business is moving online now. Perhaps I am misunderstanding the nature of AEOs.</p>]
[<p eid="para_148">Does Mr. Keegan have a perspective on this?</p>]
