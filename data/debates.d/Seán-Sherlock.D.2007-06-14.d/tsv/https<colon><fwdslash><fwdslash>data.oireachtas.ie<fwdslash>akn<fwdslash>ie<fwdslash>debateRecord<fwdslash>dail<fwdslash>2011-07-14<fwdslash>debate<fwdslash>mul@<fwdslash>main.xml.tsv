SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs; Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Ireland is a successful major centre for Industrial operations.  In the ICT sector nine of the top ten software companies in the world have substantial operations here.  The ready availability of top quality talent has been an important contributing factor to the success of both multinational and indigenous companies in Ireland.  The cluster of internationally renowned firms and smaller Irish companies offer a range of attractive career opportunities for professionals.I am aware of the skills shortage currently being experienced by industrial employers, and particularly within the ICT industry.  As part of frequent discussions which I and my Department and agencies have with Industry, I recently met with ICT Ireland, the ICT arm of IBEC along with my colleague, Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills. Industry representatives outlined their concern at the shortage of skilled graduates for the vacancies that currently exist in this industry.The Minister for Education and Skills outlined his plan for meeting the needs of the ICT Sector in the short and medium term.  This includes the Springboard programme, which will provide approximately 6,000 part time higher education places for unemployed people.  The programmes are in areas where skills shortages or potential employment growth opportunities have been identified by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN).  Nineteen public and private higher education providers will offer a total of 65 ICT courses, with a target enrolment of 2,074 students.  This is the single biggest area of provision (31%) supported through Springboard.I also met on 11 July with the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which represents US Business in Ireland, and this was one of the issues raised.  The Chamber has recently done a survey of its members which indicates a number of vacancies which are difficult to fill, arising mainly from skill shortages in the ICT and Engineering fields.  The number of vacancies revealed in this survey was similar to the number identified by the EGFSN.  The Chamber had also discussed the matter with the Minister for Education and Skills.  It very much welcomed Minister Quinn's proposed Action Plan on the issue, and indicated that industry is anxious to play its part in implementing this.  The Chamber also expressed the view that, for the longer term, initiatives in second level education in mathematics and science would be crucial to addressing the matching of skills with Science, Technology and Engineering employment opportunities.
