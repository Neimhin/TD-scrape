[<p eid="para_15">I move amendment No. 1:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2012.28.dail.3.amd_1"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_16">In page 7, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_17">" "relevant trust" means a trust, which may include a company, a body corporate other than a company or an unincorporated body of persons, established for charitable purposes and-</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_18">(<i>a</i>) which is or was engaged in the management, administration, operation, supervision or regulation of an institution specified in the Schedule to the Act of 2002, or</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_19">(<i>b</i>) which is a person listed in the First Schedule to the Deed made on 5 June 2002 between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education and Science of the one part and the persons listed in the First Schedule to that deed of the other part;”.</p>, <p eid="para_20">This amendment replaces the definition of "relevant trust" in the Bill with a more extensive one.  It is essentially a technical amendment to ensure all congregations that managed scheduled institutions fall within the scope of the Bill's provisions on the charitable status of their contributions to the statutory fund or generally towards the costs of redress.  The new definition provides for a relevant trust to include a trust which is or was involved in the management of scheduled institutions for the purposes of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 or a congregation that was party to the 2002 indemnity agreement.  The amendment is in response to concerns that a particular congregation may not have come within the original definition.</p>]
[<p eid="para_22">Sections 42 and 29 will facilitate that process.  I have given the definition for it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_24">Exactly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_39">I beg the Chair's indulgence.  Before addressing the substantive issues involved, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, sends his apologies as he is unable to attend today's session.  In addition, I acknowledge on his behalf the presence in the Visitors Gallery of representatives of the survivor groups.</p>, <p eid="para_40">I believe strongly the Minister has addressed the points made by Deputy Clare Daly on Second Stage.  The effect of these amendments would be to widen significantly eligibility for the fund.  Some suggest former residents who would be eligible for a reward from the redress board should be eligible, while it is unclear in other instances as to whether the proposal is to include all former residents, irrespective of whether they were abused in scheduled institutions.  Amendment No. 7 also proposes to include family members of former residents in the case of education services.</p>, <p eid="para_41">One must recognise the Bill's primary purpose is to establish a statutory fund to support the needs of survivors in keeping with the all-party motion agreed unanimously by Dáil Éireann in the aftermath of publication of the Ryan report.  As Deputies are aware, a maximum of €110 million will be available to the fund to assist approximately 15,000 potential beneficiaries.  Were eligibility to be significantly widened to include, for example, all former residents of scheduled institutions as is being proposed, the amounts available to fund services for individuals could be reduced greatly and the effectiveness of the statutory fund put at risk.  Some of the amendments refer to former residents who were eligible to apply under the redress Act.  Anyone could apply to the redress board and more than 900 applications to the board were withdrawn, refused or resulted in no award, generally on the basis that the person concerned had not been resident in a scheduled institution.</p>, <p eid="para_42">The Government has deliberately proposed confining entitlement to the 15,000 survivors who have come through the redress process.  Were the fund to investigate applications to establish residence and injury consistent with the alleged abuse, clearly a considerable bureaucracy similar to the Residential Institutions Redress Board would be required.  The statutory fund is neither intended nor designed to consider issues such as abuse.  Because it accepts applications only from those who received an award from the courts or the redress board, all issues related to abuse have been dealt with, thereby allowing the fund to focus on needs.  Extensive efforts were made to facilitate claims to the redress board and the former residents who did not apply to the board can continue to avail of the counselling and family tracing services available.</p>, <p eid="para_43">The motivation for amendment No. 7 appears to be to allow the child of a former resident who received an award from the redress board benefit from the fund in so far as it relates to educational services.  I should point out that the receipt of a grant or assistance for educational services from the education finance board was not linked to the receipt of an award from the redress board.  Any former resident and his or her relatives, including children and grandchildren, could benefit.  Widening eligibility to include children and grandchildren would result in a broadening of the scope of the fund beyond that which is intended.</p>, <p eid="para_44">While amendments Nos. 15 and 16, which we will address later, also deal with the issue, I wish to say at this point that it remains the Government's position that eligibility for the new fund should be confined to former residents.  The education finance board did excellent work in terms of distributing the moneys that came from the religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement.  Former residents and their relatives benefited from this support.  It was always clear that particular fund would run out and we are now almost at that point.  I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Deputies regarding the range of eligibility issues but I urge them to see the sense of the Government's position or the manner in which we are trying to operate on this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_45">On individual issues that were raised by Deputies Ryan and Ó Ríordáin, the redress board ran a comprehensive advertising campaign.  It cost approximately €900,000, involving press, television and radio advertising over a two-week period in January and February 2003.  In addition, it held 12 information days throughout the UK in 2004 and distributed 15,000 leaflets to the network of Irish societies.  It also placed advertisements in UK newspapers and in Irish publications in the United States and Australia.  The board placed advertisements in Irish and UK newspapers highlighting each ministerial order which added institutions to the schedule of the redress Act.  It also advertised the closing date in 2005 in Irish and UK newspapers and in Irish publications in the United States and Australia.  Since its establishment, the board has placed a total of 1,492 advertisements.</p>, <p eid="para_46">In speaking of the grouping of amendments, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, addressed the specific points made.  On Second Stage, he stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_47">[N]ot to have an open-ended, long, tortuous, bureaucratic quango come into existence, we have decided pragmatically, in the full knowledge of the decision we were making, that we would use the database of the 15,000 people who have already been given awards.  That is the database that is already there - we know what it is. To start again, given their age and given the period when the abuse took place, would have taken an enormous amount of time in terms of processing and verifying that information.</p>, <p eid="para_48">The Minister has been clear on this.  We must go back to the fact that if it is opened up again, it is not possible to quantify the number of persons who would come forward again.  There are no definitive numbers in that sense.  In terms of expectations, if the eligibility criteria were opened up, one could take as a fair barometer the 940 applications which were not deemed eligible under the redress board applications.</p>, <p eid="para_49">The best approach is that outlined by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on Second Stage, which is to proceed on the basis proposed in the Bill.  The question of reviewing eligibility can be considered after the fund is established in the event of there not being a significant expenditure of the fund.  There is some scope.  I must, therefore, oppose the amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_65">I will respond to Deputy Ryan's point first.  When I mentioned advertising and so forth, I did so to show that the State sought in good faith to reach out and advertise.  I take the Deputy's point, which he also made in good faith.</p>, <p eid="para_66">An amendment requiring a review within a certain timeframe could be considered on Report Stage, but only following the fund's establishment.  At that time, the committee could deliberate with the Minister on how to proceed.  Some consideration should be given to an amendment along the lines proposed.  I will reflect this point of view to the Minister.</p>, <p eid="para_67">Members should examine the amendments' wording.  Deputy Crowe's states "eligible to apply" and Deputy Smith's states "eligible to receive", but eligibility needs to be established.  If persons did not come forward during the first process, one would need to set up a bureaucratic mechanism to establish eligibility.  We are not in a position to do so.  In the Minister's opinion, an estimate of 15,000 people is the fairest way to deal with the matter.  He has been clear in this regard.  We do not know what the numbers are, as they range from a few people to a couple of hundred to a significant cohort, depending on whom one asks.  There comes a point when a line must be drawn.  I do not want to use emotive language and we must be mindful of the sensitivities involved, but the Minister stated his intentions on Second Stage clearly.  We will oppose the amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">With all due respect, I wish to establish a barometer in terms of how we proceed.  I will not be patronised and I want to deal with the Deputies respectfully, but we have an understanding of the issues at hand and we want to address them with a degree of sensitivity and respect.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">I may have used the word "bureaucracy" but I am not sure I used the words "massive bureaucracy".  If I did, it was not to imply that a whole machine would have to be created around this.  The central point is that the fund is €110 million in respect of which 15,000 have already made an application.  Some 940 people were deemed ineligible under the redress process because they were not residents of the scheduled institutions.</p>, <p eid="para_75">On the legal advice issue, legal advice was taken up by 97% of those who applied under the original scheme.  That advice was independent legal advice which the people sought.  I am not suggesting that those people did not have an entitlement to that legal advice, I am merely stressing it was independent legal advice sought by them.  People had a degree of autonomy and discretion in terms of whom they chose as their legal advisers.  It was important that was inherent in the original scheme.</p>, <p eid="para_76">On eligibility to apply, the bureaucratic aspect arises from the fact that we would again now have to establish where the injury took place, which re-opens the whole process.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has made clear his position in regard to the proposed amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_121">Clearly an annual reporting and review mechanism could be established once the fund is established.  It is reasonable to ask for the committee to have due regard to the workings of the fund or review the process.  We should all adopt an open mind on how it is structured.  When the Minister addresses Report and Final Stages there should be some response to the suggestions made on the fund, its uses, and where spare, if any, resources are deployed.  At this stage of the process, and not to be too specific, I acknowledge that the issue was raised, that the Minister will attend for the next stage and that members have asked that he have regard to the concerns that they raised.</p>]
[<p eid="para_123">Yes, there is potential for an oversight role.  I feel strongly that I should not make a definitive statement on it at this stage.  The Minister will have regard to the process and, effectively, with due deference to his role as the Minister for Education and Skills who sits at Cabinet, then we should give consideration to the role, and there should be a response to the suggestions.  The fund's <i> modus operandi</i> should be determined by the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">There will be an annual report that should give rise to a process in terms of how it is parsed, examined or interpreted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_134">Counselling services are specifically provided for in section 8 of the Bill as a class of approved service.  I am uncertain as to the intent behind some of the proposed amendments.  While I appreciate the concerns that a former resident's existing counsellor be retained once the fund is established, I do not see how that position would be threatened simply because the fund is established.  People can continue to attend their existing counsellor, which may be funded under the National Counselling Service, without recourse to the fund.  If individuals are privately attending counsellors and wish to apply to the fund to have this service funded, the person could advise the fund of this preference in their application.  Once the counsellor meets the criteria for service providers specified by the fund, it is difficult to envisage why the fund would not agree to such an arrangement.  I have no doubt that issues such as these are a concern to individual former residents, but they are matters of detail that should be left to the fund, which is required to act in the interests of the former residents.  In other words, what is inherent in the legislation is the interests of former residents and the fund, by its nature and the spirit in which it is set up, is to look after the needs of people in terms of counselling services.</p>, <p eid="para_135">The proposal in amendment No. 10 that a one-off payment be made from the fund is not acceptable given that there is no apparent linkage with the needs of a former resident.  The purpose of the fund is not, and never was, a form of additional compensation.  That issue has been dealt with by the redress board.  It is, as advocated in the original motion passed by the House, intended for the support of victims.  Eligible former residents will have a range of needs, with some likely to require more significant interventions than others, and the approach set out in the Bill is intended to support these needs.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_143">I would like to open this up a little because it is worthy of discussion.  We agree counselling is a statutory entitlement provided by the National Counselling Service.  If it is a statutory entitlement, I do not see the need for this amendment, and I say that respectfully because there is a class of approved services in section 8.  I do not dispute the points made by the Deputies and I understand the spirit in which the amendments were tabled.  My instinct is perhaps to look at this on Report Stage but clarity around the purpose of the amendments is needed.  I understand the points made in regard to fears people have about autonomy and so on.  Is there an inherent fear that somehow the services will be reduced or withdrawn at some future date?  If that is the case, perhaps this can be revisited at a later stage and further clarification can be provided by the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">I would like to ensure Deputy Crowe, or any Deputy, has access at all times to the officials in the Department.  If Deputy Crowe wishes to discuss that specific issue with the officials, there is no problem.</p>]
[<p eid="para_152">The purpose of the amendment is to require the board to make information available in regard to its functions to all applicants to the redress board.  As the Deputy will be aware, more than 900 applications to the redress board were withdrawn, refused or resulted in no award generally on the grounds that they were not resident in scheduled institutions as defined in the Act.  I do not believe the amendment is required.  There is no need to contact the 900 plus persons to whom I referred as they will not be eligible to benefit from the fund.  Furthermore, there is no mechanism for doing so due to the confidentiality restrictions of the redress process.  The intention of the scheme is to oblige the board to make information available on its functions to former residents.  I respectfully argue that the amendment is not necessary and, therefore, I cannot accept it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_157">I will respond to the amendment first and will then maybe engage further with Deputy Crowe on it.  The amendment proposed would require the board to correspond with all applicants who applied to the redress board, even those who did not receive an award.  As I said in regard to the previous amendment, it is not permissible to contact individual recipients of redress board awards due to the confidentiality provisions of the 2002 Act.</p>, <p eid="para_158">The Bill empowers the redress board to provide awardees' names, addresses and dates of birth to the statutory fund which will enable the fund to verify applicants' entitlements to apply.  That is the only purpose for which the information can be used.  The Attorney General's office has advised that any direct unsolicited communication with survivors could be open to a challenge as it might encroach on their right to privacy under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The redress board process was strictly confidential with the unauthorised disclosure of information being a criminal offence under the 2002 Residential Institutions Redress Act.</p>, <p eid="para_159">Apart from the strict legal issues, the Deputy will also be aware that issues relating to abuse are extremely sensitive and the sending of unsolicited letters to persons' private addresses could pose difficulties.  As was noted on Second Stage, some survivors have still not told their partners what they experienced in childhood.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_161">I acknowledge the point Deputy Crowe made and the spirit in which the amendment was tabled.  I utterly agree with the sincerity of the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_172">I accept the points made by Deputy Crowe and his desire to ensure we learn from the mistakes of the past and provide for a degree of probity in this matter.  The amendment appears to require the board to engage consultants only by way of fixed-term contracts and provides for an annual review mechanism involving the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While I appreciate that the objective behind the amendment may be to restrict in some way the use of consultants, a legislative approach is not appropriate for such a matter.  The amendment appears to assume that consultants and legal advisers will be appointed on a regular basis.  It is not clear on what basis this assumption is made.  It is the Government's intention that the use of such external advisers be kept to a minimum, while enabling the board to fulfil its mandate.  The use of fixed-term contracts may not be the most appropriate or cost-effective way to bring in such expertise.  The board should be given flexibility to choose the most appropriate way of dealing with the issues, subject to overall public service guidelines in these matters.  The board will require ministerial approval to enter into contracts or engage consultants.  I believe this is sufficient oversight of the arrangements.</p>]
[<p eid="para_174">Section 7(3) states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_175">In performing any functions conferred on it by or under this Act, the Board shall have regard to the existence of publicly available services and the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of the resources available in the investment account.</p>, <p eid="para_176">We would argue that the subsection would sufficiently cover the spirit of the points raised by Deputy Crowe.  I see where the Deputy is coming from.  Perhaps there could be further consultation with the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, if the amendment was withdrawn, on how the matter could be clarified to ensure the Deputy's concerns are addressed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_179">I refer Members to section 10(1) in respect of directions of the Minister, which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_180">The Minister may, in relation to the performance by the Board of its functions, give a direction in writing to the Board requiring it to comply with such policies of the Government as are specified in the direction.</p>, <p eid="para_181">The power of the Minister is clear in terms of giving the direction but in keeping with the concerns raised by the Deputies, this is a matter that could be discussed at a later stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_191">We discussed this issue during the debate on amendment No. 7.  The effect of these amendments would be to extend eligibility for the fund to the children and grandchildren of former residents in so far as educational services are concerned.  They would also include employment opportunities.  I am aware that the Education Finance Board provided significant supports both to former residents and their relatives and the Deputies will be aware that the €12.7 million fund set aside for educational purposes under the 2002 indemnity agreement is now virtually exhausted.  Through this Bill, the Government is now focusing on meeting the needs of former residents across a range of service areas, having regard to the available moneys and the potential numbers eligible to apply.  I believe that to do this effectively, it must confine itself to the eligible former residents.  On that basis I cannot accept the amendment.</p>, <p eid="para_192">There is not unanimity across groups representing survivors on this particular issue.  The fund is €110 million and there are 15,000 potential beneficiaries, but there is also the student grants scheme which has income thresholds, and 41% of full-time undergraduate higher education students are in receipt of such grants.  Therefore, there are statutory schemes in place already with clear income thresholds for which the children and grandchildren of the former residents are eligible.  I would again like to restate that a review of eligibility under the fund is possible if the demands are not significant.  That is where the review element of this comes in and the Minister for Education and Skills will respond to it at a further stage.</p>, <p eid="para_193">We are saying that we cannot accept the amendment, but there could be further discussion of this at a later stage.  However, I think the Minister was clear about this on Second Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_195">Can the Deputy clarify the 2.8% figure?</p>]
[<p eid="para_197">How do we know that?  The confidentiality arrangements inherent within the initial redress scheme-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_199">Was it the-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_201">I am not disputing it, but I would like to seek clarification on that.  If there is a withdrawal of the amendments at this juncture-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_203">There could be further discussion without prejudice to see if the Minister could take it on board at a later stage.  It is important to remember that the €12.7 million fund set aside for educational purposes is virtually exhausted, and this must be borne in mind for this process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_209">We have spoken about the issue.  We have been very specific about the €12.7 million fund and the fact that there was a significant fund available for educational attainment through the Education Finance Board.  In fairness, the State had given a clear commitment on that so the State's response is measured in that sense.  However, there is scope to have further discussion on the issues raised in amendments Nos. 7, 15 and 16 and the Minister will give a clear direction on them at a later stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_217">I speak to the spirit of everything that has been said today.  No one with a shred of humanity in his heart would disagree or fail to empathise with what is being said but I must be clear about the scope of the Bill.  It goes beyond its scope to introduce a statutory entitlement.  Nevertheless I take in good faith the arguments made.</p>, <p eid="para_218">These amendments have been disallowed.  However, on Report Stage there should be a conversation on meeting the physical needs, including housing and shelter of persons who find themselves in this morass.  Liaising mechanisms have been set up and are available try to assist people with these physical needs.  These are already inherent and available under various other pillars.  For the purposes of this legislation there is no plan to introduce a statutory entitlement.  The amendments have been disallowed but given the progress of the legislation it should give rise to a further discussion on Report Stage.  That is the best we can do at this stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_222">Deputy Daly proposes the deletion of section 8(4) in its entirety.  The subsection is an important provision, however, in that it gives the board the flexibility to determine different classes.  These are classes not in a class sense as we understand it but in terms of trying to define a range of subjects, services, people or former residents.  It provides the board with flexibility, therefore, in terms of the determination of services.  For example, it could set different entitlements depending on the age of former residents.  It is not intended to be restrictive or exclusive; the opposite is the case.  It is designed to give the board the flexibility it needs to meet the wide range of needs of former residents.  I am rather concerned at the proposal to delete the wording set out in the Bill and I oppose the amendment on that basis.  Language is all important in this process.  Ultimately, this section serves to ensure that a flexibility is available.  It is like referring to a class of car.  It speaks to the range of services and there should be some flexibility inherent in it.  The word is used from a legislative point of view.</p>]
[<p eid="para_225">With respect to the Deputy, I suggest the word "type" is worse because a "type" of former resident could be deemed in certain circumstances to be interpreted as pejorative as well.  Let us normalise the word "class" here and now: it is a normal word.  There is no subjective nature to it.  The spirit of the word "class" in this sense is to ensure there is flexibility around the range of services that can be provided.  I am unsure whether another word could be used.  "Class" is a rather innocuous word and no offence is intended by it.  For the purposes of designing the legislation it gives flexibility in terms of the determination of services.</p>]
[<p eid="para_227">It is important to nail this down so that there is no misinterpretation.  Let us suppose we were discussing social protection legislation for the over 70s.  That segment of the population would be classed as the over 70s.  It is a class of the population.  With all due respect, one must class subsections when dealing with legislation.  The aim in this instance is to ensure flexibility in the determination of services.  If the services are being defined, there has to be a class of services or categories.  There is nothing pejorative or demeaning in the use of the word "class" in this instance.  It does not seek to stigmatise anyone in any way; that is not the intent in the use of the word.</p>]
[<p eid="para_231">The effect of the amendment would be to preclude the board from including in its criteria a provision that would require it to take into consideration the financial circumstances of an applicant.  The purpose of the fund is to allow it to target the needs of former residents.  By removing the power of the board to include financial circumstances in its criteria potentially it would allow a former resident with extensive means to apply to the board and receive supports and services on the same basis as a less wealthy individual, whereas the objective is to meet the needs of those most in need.</p>, <p eid="para_232">I emphasise that this provision is not intended to introduce a general means test application to the fund.  It will be a matter for the fund to have regard to the need to take account of an individual's financial circumstances when determining its criteria for its decisions.  This provision is most assuredly not intended as a way of preventing vulnerable persons in need from benefiting from the supports that will be available under the fund.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_240">Section 14(9) allows the board to designate a staff member to perform the functions of the chief executive officer in the event of that officer being absence or the position being vacant.  This is a reasonable provision and while such situations may be rare, they may occur from time to time.  The amendment would have the effect of preventing any member of staff, including one designated by the board under section 14 to perform the functions of the chief executive officer, from giving evidence before a committee of Dáil Éireann.</p>, <p eid="para_241">I find the proposal a little strange and I am unclear why an acting chief executive officer could not come before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions on various issues.  The Deputy is suggesting that if the Committee of Public Accounts wishes to examine issues relating to the books and accounts of the fund, it should be precluded from calling the senior staff member of the fund to appear before it.  I am unclear why the fund should be treated differently from other public bodies.  We are all committed to ensuring full accountability and I am not sure the amendment would sustain that level of accountability.</p>]
[<p eid="para_245">I acknowledge the points that have been made.  One might interpret the amendment as making a certain point about the power of the Oireachtas in terms of summoning witnesses before it.  I refer here to the spirit as opposed to the letter of the law.  The reality, however, is that there is no precedent, in so far as I am aware, where a chief executive officer of a statutory body or fund has failed to appear before the Oireachtas on being summoned.  It is pertinent and proper to ensure that the board can designate its staff to perform the functions of the chief executive officer in the event of the latter's absence or the position being vacant.  That is common sense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_248">The board could likewise decide to take that action.  The key point here is that we should not undermine our own role as legislators in terms of the ability to summon people before us, as per Deputy Smith's point.  I acknowledge the argument he has made in that sense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_253">I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  Despite the difficult economic circumstances, a cap of €5,000 per annum on the remuneration, allowance and expenses of the staff of the board would be punitive.  I do not know whether the Deputy has included the amendment under this section in error.  Subsection (4) states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_254">The members of the board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, hold office on such terms and conditions (including terms and conditions relating to the payment of allowances for expenses) as may be determined by the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>, <p eid="para_255">There is no provision in the Bill for remuneration of board members.</p>]
[<p eid="para_257">To clarify, they will be entitled only to expenses.  It is a non-remunerated board.</p>]
[<p eid="para_259">Deputy Crowe's amendment relates to section 17, the provisions of which relate to the staff of the board.  There is a distinction between persons employed as administrators and those who are members of the board.</p>]
[<p eid="para_268">What is proposed here might not be deemed to be a charge on the Exchequer for the purposes of considering the amendment but it would be hugely costly to undertake large print runs of the report in order to furnish copies to every public library across the State.  It is the norm in this day and age that annual reports and other public documents are published electronically and accessed online.  The amendment also places a requirement on the board that the placement of the reports in public libraries be advertised in local and national newspapers.  That potential cost alone obliges me to reject the amendment.  There are sufficient ways of bringing reports of this nature into the public domain.  The cost of disseminating them to local libraries and advertising same would be utterly prohibitive.  The question arises as to who would fund that cost and how it would be determined.</p>]
[<p eid="para_270">I assure members that I acknowledge the spirit of the proposals they have brought forward.</p>]
[<p eid="para_276">I appreciate that Deputy Crowe is endeavouring to ensure that any payments made to former residents will not affect their social welfare entitlements in this jurisdiction or outside the State.  I am sympathetic to the general principle involved.  However, I do not believe that this legislation is the appropriate vehicle to address the concerns raised.  The board would not be in a position to ensure an outcome such as that intended.  An amendment to the social welfare regulations would, if deemed necessary, be more appropriate.  This issue could certainly be pursued in the event that difficulties emerge down the line.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Oireachtas cannot legislate in respect of the affairs of other jurisdictions.  A provision such as that being proposed is unenforceable.  I cannot accept the amendment on that basis.</p>]
[<p eid="para_278">Let us keep in mind the purpose of the Bill, namely, to provide services in the first instance.  If the Deputy is suggesting that the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection should liaise further in respect of the issues he has outlined, I am of the view that this should be done prior to Report Stage.  If the Deputy so wishes, we can engage in such an exercise.</p>]
[<p eid="para_280">If it relates to matters outside the jurisdiction, then it would be unenforceable.</p>]
[<p eid="para_285">Again, let us keep in mind that the fund is designed to assist and be proactive in terms of meeting people's needs.  It is not meant to place a block in the way of applications.  The amendment seeks to delete section 20(4)(<i>b</i>), the provisions contained in which are reasonable in the context of assisting the board in considering applications.  It is not unreasonable for the board to seek certain basic information or consents from applicants.  It must be borne in mind that this information will be sought for the purposes of assisting in the consideration of applications.  If an applicant fails to provide information, it would be reasonable for the board to refuse to consider the matter further until such information is provided.  It is on this basis that we cannot accept the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_287">If the Deputy is seeking to soften the language used or the approach being taken, I can appreciate what she is trying to do.  Again, however, we must have regard to the fact that the fund is designed to assist people in a positive fashion.  One cannot then be prescriptive or set out schedules as to how people in varying circumstances should be dealt with.  That may not be what the Deputy was driving at but she can clarify the position when she responds.  I accept that there are sensitivities involved but we must create a scenario whereby employees of the fund who are dealing with requests for funding or a service will be allowed to gather any information which may be required.  It is also necessary to put in place structures to deal with instances where requests for such information are refused, namely, an application will not proceed unless the required information is furnished.  I am of the opinion that this is reasonable because, by its very nature, the fund is designed to assist people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_289">I am going to stick to my guns on this one on the basis that this is enabling legislation.  To use the example of medical circumstances where assistance is being provided in that respect, one must have regard to an individual's medical circumstances.  If one does not have the information, one cannot make a determination and proceed any further with an application.  Once the fund is set up, one must have a mechanism to provide structures to allow the board to refuse to consider an applicant if the person is remiss in not yielding certain information.  There must be a degree of co-operation, otherwise the process becomes intractable.  One could have a body of cases awaiting a determination that could drag on for years.  We need to be able to expedite every case efficiently to ensure that those who will become clients of the service want to ensure there is an efficiency built into the service in order that it runs smoothly and in their favour.</p>, <p eid="para_290">I do not believe there is anything wrong with what is being suggested in subsection 4(<i>b</i>).  It states, “enabling the Board to refuse to further consider the application if the request under <i>paragraph (a)</i> is not complied with and the Board may so request or refuse to further consider the application in accordance with the procedures”.  Any public servant I know of who deals on a front-of-house basis with individuals or fellow citizens will seek to assist a person along but if the person does not co-operate or stonewalls in terms of providing particular information, there comes a time when one must make a call on it, and this provision allows for that.  One must reflect on the spirit of the legislation.  The Bill is designed to try to assist people.  By its very nature it is set up to assist and enable people to gain assess to the services.</p>]
[<p eid="para_296">No, not at this stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_302">I would point out that section 23 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of information and provides for it to be a criminal offence.  Disclosure is not unauthorised in specific circumstances such as to the Garda Síochána, child protection services, etc.</p>, <p eid="para_303">Section 24 provides that "personal information", defined as being the name, address and date of birth of an applicant, can be furnished by the Residential Institutions Redress Board to the board of the statutory fund.  It further provides that this information can only be used to determine whether a person is eligible to make an application to the board and for no other purpose.</p>, <p eid="para_304">Amendment No. 31 would make it a requirement that the applicant providing the information would be informed while amendment No. 32 would prohibit disclosure of information to third parties.  I fail to see that either of these amendments are necessary or that they add to the Bill.  I do not see that there is anything to be gained by informing an applicant that information is being disclosed and perhaps there is much to be lost, particularly if sensitive information needs to be brought to the attention of the statutory authorities urgently.  Given that the provisions of section 24 are already restrictive, the amendment is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept either amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_306">I will get an explanation for the Deputy and we can revert to her.  Section 24 provides that personal information defined as being the name, address and date of birth of an applicant can be furnished by the Residential Institutions Redress Board to the board of the statutory fund, namely, the fund in question.  It further provides that the information can only be used to determine whether a person is eligible to make an application to the board and for no other purpose.  Amendment No. 31 would make it a requirement that the applicant providing the information would be informed but that it would prohibit the disclosure of information to third parties.  I do not see how that is necessary for the purposes of determining the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_307">In section 23, on page 21 of Bill, confidential information means information that refers to a former resident or that could reasonably lead to the identification of a former resident.  In terms of disclosure issues, we seek to introduce a belt and braces approach to how information is dealt with to ensure that the privacy of individuals is utterly sacrosanct.  That is already inherent within the sections as laid out in the Bill.</p>]
[<p eid="para_309">That is it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_311">The amendment to section 31 proposes that no disclosure shall be made prior to informing the applicant.  I suggest that one must think carefully about how one would communicate that, to whom and to which house it would go.  One must still have a degree of security around ensuring that no third party could potentially have access to the information if, for example, a person changes address.  One must be careful to ensure one does not compromise the confidentiality that exists.</p>]
[<p eid="para_313">Again, if the Deputy looks at section 23(3) on page 22, a person does not contravene section 23(3) by disclosing confidential information if the disclosure is made to or authorised by the board or is made to the Garda Síochána where the person is acting in good faith and reasonably believes that such disclosure is necessary in order to prevent an act or omission constituting a serious offence, or is made to an appropriate person within the meaning of the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, where the person is acting in good faith and reasonably believes that such disclosure is necessary to prevent, reduce or remove a substantial risk to life, or to prevent the continuance of abuse of a child.  Section 23(2)(<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) are also relevant.  We feel strongly that the legislation is sufficient in terms of the disclosure of information as per Deputy Daly’s amendment No. 32, but in terms of amendment No. 31, by virtue of section 23(3) it is set out how one must be careful about how one communicates.</p>]
[<p eid="para_327">Nobody would disagree with the Deputy.  There is no question that we all share that sentiment.  I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment.  I cannot accept the amendment because under the terms of the indemnity agreement reached with the religious congregations and the then Government on 5 June 2002, the congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the redress scheme.  The contribution comprised cash, the provision of counselling services and the transfer of properties.  The full amount of the cash contribution has been received.  The congregations have met their contribution in terms of the provision of counselling services.  Property transfers valued at €41.37 million, that is 41 properties, have been fully completed and there are 20 remaining properties which have not been fully and finally accepted by the Department.</p>, <p eid="para_328">The congregations had agreed to transfer these properties under the indemnity agreement subject to good and marketable title being furnished.  All of these properties are in use or available for use by the intended recipients.  Nevertheless, the Chief State Solicitor's office continues to pursue the legal requirements issue under the indemnity agreement.  Regular meetings are continuing involving our Department, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office to finalise the transfer process under the terms of the indemnity agreement.  In the event of a shortfall regarding the value of the properties offered and that provided under the agreement, the shortfall could be made up by the relevant congregation providing alternative properties.  In any event, the agreement provides for the full amount of €128 million to be recovered, whether received in property or in cash form.</p>, <p eid="para_329">While one cannot put a timeframe on completion due to the complex nature of the remaining transfers, I can assure the committee, as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has assured it, that every effort is being made to complete the process as expeditiously as possible.</p>]
[<p eid="para_334">The section as drafted allows for the interest accrued on the €21.05 million held on deposit in the Central Bank to be paid to the fund.  The cap of €110 million in subsection (4) only refers to the contributions paid under subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) or expected under subsection (2)(<i>a</i>).  Any associated interest can be paid into the fund and is dealt with in subsections (1)(<i>b</i>) and (2)<i>(b</i>).  Deputy Daly’s proposed amendment, therefore, is unnecessary and I oppose it.  However, Deputy Daly may wish to withdraw the amendment in light of the explanation.</p>, <p eid="para_335">I can advise the committee in this general context that interest of almost €250,000 has been earned on the contributions lodged to the Central Bank to date.  The congregations made their contribution offers in late 2009, and some agreed to pay their cash contributions due in the short term in interest bearing accounts pending the establishment of the fund.  The section allows for that interest to be contributed to the Minister outside the €110,000 cap.</p>, <p eid="para_336">I wish to signal our intention to bring forward a further technical amendment to this section to address some of the charities' concerns that their payments to the fund are consistent with charity law obligations.  Officials are continuing to liaise with the congregations' legal advisers and the Attorney General's office in this regard, and it will be necessary to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to address those concerns.</p>]

This technical amendment provides the agency with greater flexibility in regard to investment decisions.  Moneys standing to the credit of the fund are likely to be invested by the NTMA over a range of maturities depending on the fund's view of the likely schedule of draw-downs from the fund.  This technical amendment ensures that the NTMA has discretion to roll over investments and vary the maturities of investments without having to seek the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in each case.</p>]
[<p eid="para_345">The amendment will not have any material effect because if the words "and other costs" are deleted it will not materially affect the provision.  The definition of an "expense" in the Oxford English Dictionary refers to a cost incurring.  We could consider agreeing to an amendment on Report Stage as it would have no material effect.  Perhaps Deputy Daly will consider that matter and we can have a further discussion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_347">We can.  Can we consider it on Report Stage?  The wording of the amendment does not change the legislation substantially.</p>]
[<p eid="para_349">If I agree with the sentiments the Deputy is expressing, the amendment will still have no bearing.  It is a technical amendment.  The phrase  "and other costs" does not necessarily speak in terms of the amendment, bearing in mind the aspirations of the Deputy regarding the expenditure of public resources and remuneration.</p>]
[<p eid="para_351">If we are to legislate expeditiously, it must be stated that the phrase "and other costs" will not materially affect the provision.  That is the ultimate point, regardless of the semantics of the argument.  The Government is willing to re-consider this on Report Stage.</p>]

It provides that such contributions are charitable gifts and enables the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland to approve of property sales, mortgages and transfers within the context of the charities making such contributions.  We intend to table a further technical amendment to the section to address some of the charities' concerns that their contributions are consistent with charity law obligations.  Officials are continuing to liaise with the congregations' legal advisers and the Office of the Attorney General in this regard.
