SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2015-11-03T15:10:00+00:00	The Government is strongly committed to Ireland’s overseas aid programme and to its place at the heart of our foreign policy. “One World, One Future”, our policy for international development, clearly articulates the Government’s commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for official development assistance, ODA. This commitment was reiterated by the Taoiseach at the UN Summit in New York in September which adopted a new set of sustainable development goals to guide international development policy and action for the next 15 years. Our track record in support of Ireland’s aid programme is clear. Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty. In that time, we have provided over €3 billion for ODA. We have stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target, once economic conditions allow. Now, as our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can begin to make good on that commitment. On budget day, the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years. For 2016, we have provided a total of over €640 million in ODA, an increase of €40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 level. We estimate this will entail a small increase in our ODA-GNP percentage from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016, so we still have a long way to go. The challenge now is to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented humanitarian crises throughout the globe, especially in Europe’s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-11-03T15:10:00+00:00	We continue to maintain a very strong relationship with the NGOs, which are partly funded by the taxpayer through Irish Aid. The issue the UN and the multilateral organisations are trying to grapple with at present is the major challenge of how, globally, governments are going to be able to fund the commitment into the future. To answer the Deputy's question, one of the issues we are now looking at is that of how we manage the dynamic between long-term development goals, such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the numerous humanitarian crises that are breaking out, for example, in the Mediterranean, as well as how we manage the interoperability between long-term development goals and humanitarian crises. There is also the question of how we leverage the opportunities within the global private sector. The private sector has a role to play and, within the Department, we are trying to get a greater degree of traction in that relationship which goes beyond mere corporate social responsibility. At the multilateral level, through the UN and other organisations, Ireland has an important role to play.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-11-03T15:10:00+00:00	We would openly encourage organisations to interact with each other. We would really like to see a greater degree of consolidation of effort and we do not want to see any duplication of effort. Irish Aid has a track record, through its relationships with organisations like GOAL, of providing the seed funding that then allows GOAL to leverage the opportunities, such as in its response in Syria. If we can encourage a greater degree of that kind of leveraging effort and bring in the private sector, as I said, beyond mere corporate social responsibility, then I believe that pitches Ireland onto a greater global stage. We advocate that policy and we are working towards trying to get a greater degree of traction in that regard.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2015-11-03T17:50:00+00:00	I thank the Tánaiste for sharing her time. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan will set out to the House the developments regarding the all-party talks in Belfast in which he and I have been involved over the past several weeks. Beyond the talks, the work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across Government. Nowhere is this more evident than in our work to promote and develop North-South co-operation. Through this work, we are building the lasting relationships between North and South which will help to copperfasten peace and stability and deliver prosperity for all our people. The success of North-South bodies like Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland demonstrate what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas. Building on these successes is now our focus.  In line with the Stormont House Agreement, a report on new economically-focused priorities was brought to the North-South Ministerial Council this year. Priority areas of co-operation for the Government include higher level education, agri-food, energy, climate change, creative industries, sport and other joint initiatives. The overarching aim is to ensure the most effective use of scarce public funds on both sides of the Border to promote economic growth and create jobs in all our communities. The Government’s commitment to North-South economic co-operation therefore remains a priority. As the Taoiseach has stated, the recently announced infrastructure and capital investment plan has a dedicated section on North-South infrastructure. In the Stormont House Agreement, the Government agreed to a financial package to support North-South work programmes as well as measures to promote reconciliation and INTERREG programmes, including the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge project and developing the Ulster canal.In this agreement, we also reaffirmed our commitment to provide £25 million in 2015 and 2016 to the A5 project. This was the source of some discussions in Stormont as late as yesterday. Research and innovation, one of the key drivers of economic growth and employment, has been a key area for North-South co-operation. For instance, the development of the North West Regional Science Park, co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, has delivered new hubs for the development of innovative businesses, creating jobs and strengthening the cross-Border links which are so vital to the economic development of the Border region. There has been very good progress to date in terms of North-South collaboration under the EU's €80 billion research and innovation Horizon 2020 programme, which was negotiated during the Irish Presidency. The first year has delivered over €19 million of EU funding to support North-South projects. We need now to build on the excellent collaborative progress to date and to work on our allied strengths in areas such as ICT, health and agri-food research to create and deliver more successful partnership projects. The expansion of Science Foundation Ireland's remit to fund researchers in the North will enable further work together on an all-island basis and will create a further leveraging opportunity. North-South co-operation also brings real day-to-day benefits to people on both sides of the Border. For example, when open next summer, the £50 million radiotherapy unit at Derry's Altnagelvin Hospital will provide access to radiotherapy services to over a half million people across the north-west region, sharing services and maximising limited resources. This co-operation also extends to the field of sport. As one Rugby World Cup ends, we look forward to 2023 when, hopefully, Ireland will be hosting this great tournament on an all-island basis. This joint North-South bid has tremendous potential to drive tourism. Speaking personally, I am hopeful that all of the stadia will be ready when the time comes. I refer to Páirc Uí Chaoimh in that respect. It is clear that North-South co-operation is crucial and indeed a central plank of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope we continue to fulfil our obligations both North and South in respect of the North-South Ministerial Council. I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a date for Armagh. It is important all political persuasions would sign up to that and that the Executive in all its forms would ensure that we continue to give that the energy it deserves. The current political difficulties should not get in the way of vitally important North-South co-operation. Now that DUP ministers have returned to their desks in Stormont, I hope the North-South Ministerial Council can resume its work, which has delivered so much benefit for citizens across the island. Whatever the difficulties, this Government will continue to work to support North-South cooperation and to help unlock the full potential of the island society and economy.
