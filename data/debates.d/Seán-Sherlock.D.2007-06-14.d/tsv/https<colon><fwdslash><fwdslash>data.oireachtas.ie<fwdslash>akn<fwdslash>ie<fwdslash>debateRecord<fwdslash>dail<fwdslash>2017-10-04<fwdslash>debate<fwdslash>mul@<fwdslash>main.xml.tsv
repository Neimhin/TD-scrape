SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:00:00+01:00	Can I just have some guidance before the Minister answers? I thought that this question was in a grouping, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. How will this now be handled? Forgive me.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:00:00+01:00	There are three priorities on the same issue, however, and they have been grouped.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:00:00+01:00	To be helpful, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 are all on the subject and are being taken together.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:00:00+01:00	Just to clarify, Deputy Stanley will respond to the Minister's answers to him and then-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:10:00+01:00	I want to focus on the procurement process. Notwithstanding what I believe to be the Minister's bona fides in seeking to get this project over the line, and I believe him to be genuine, we are getting bombarded with metrics, statistics and the use of a language that for many people who do not have broadband is indecipherable in terms of the political rhetoric around this. The first question I have is very simple. Do EU rules on procurement allow the Minister to descope or make a tender less attractive to certain vendors, thus favouring others while the tender process is live? If SIRO has pulled out of this process, what is to stop it or any other bidder, who might not partake in this tender, from looking at the legal position and saying it signed up to a process and the Minister, the State or the Government has now made that process less attractive for it as a tenderer or bidder and why should it not take legal action to protect the investment and commitments it has made? The public is confused and I am confused because I do not believe that the transparency and the information that we require on this is adequate at this time. I do not believe it is right for the Minister to use the cover of the fact that this is a competitive tendering process. As Deputy Dooley said, it is down to two entities at this stage. The Minister can hardly use the cover of the tendering process in the language he is using to explain the process itself. What were the original EU rules on procurement? What was the language that was used by the State in regard to the EU so as to protect those people who have now come out of the process on the basis that the original tender is less than what was articulated and advised to them in the first instance?

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-04T14:20:00+01:00	The Minister mentioned the auction for the 3.6 Ghz spectrum, if I am not mistaken. I would like to know the justification for it. My understanding is that there is not a definitive definition of 5G at this point in time. There is no proper definition because the technology is moving at such a quick pace and the innovation cycle is getting a lot shorter. What is the justification for the auction? What permutations will that auction have and how will it impact the provision for communications for the Garda and the emergency services in the country? Will they be adversely affected as a result of the auction? We have not had in the Minister's own words an explanation or an understanding from his perspective as to why one of the bidders pulled out. We have read a lot in the press but we, in this House, as I understand it, have not heard directly from the Minister himself as to his perspective on why SIRO pulled the plug.
