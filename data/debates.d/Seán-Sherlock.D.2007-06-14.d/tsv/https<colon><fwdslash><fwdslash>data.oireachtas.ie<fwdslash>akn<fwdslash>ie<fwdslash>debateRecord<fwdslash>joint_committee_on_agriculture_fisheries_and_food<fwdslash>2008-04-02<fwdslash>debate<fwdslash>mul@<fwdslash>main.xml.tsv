SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I apologise for being late for the meeting as I was unavoidably detained.  I apologise to the people who made the presentation as I am not fully aware of its contents.  However, I will acquaint myself with the submission that was made and I will make some general points.This is an island nation, which is an obvious thing to say, but we take no cognisance of our rich maritime history.  There is the fat of the land, but there is also the fat of the sea.  I agree with the point made previously that when the CAP was being negotiated all those years ago, the fishing industry became the poor relation and has been ever since, in spite of the fact that this is an island nation.  We have a wonderful resource but it is being depleted year on year due to environmental and other problems.  This is causing undue hardship.My view is simple.  A Minister with direct responsibility for marine and fisheries at Cabinet level is a necessity——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——if we are ever to bring to the political forefront  the notion that fisheries are an important aspect of our economy.  However, fisheries are important not only to the economy but also from a social perspective, because the fishing co-operatives in the coastal regions sustain local communities.  If we do not start thinking in terms of sustaining those communities and prioritising fisheries at Cabinet level, the industry will go deeper into the morass.  There is political rhetoric and much cognisance taken of the notion of local food production.  While the agricultural lobby is a strong one in terms of its political voice, rightly so, the fishing lobby is not as strong or does not seem to have been heard in recent years.  If we are talking about local food production, the Minister of State with responsibility for food also has to look at fisheries and their potential.  Fish has to come more to the forefront as part of the national diet.Those are very general points but it is about changing our attitude towards the fishing industry which should be seen in a more positive light.  This can only happen politically.  For it to happen politically there has to be a seat at the Cabinet table for a Minister with responsibility for the marine and fishing industry.  That is something I would wholeheartedly support.  I will be available to meet with the gentlemen present after the meeting or at some future date to hear about their concerns because I missed their submission today.  However, I will apprise myself of it.  If there is anything we can do to be of assistance, we will certainly do it.
