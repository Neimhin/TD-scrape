[<p eid="para_28">For the record I had formally requested that the Ombudsman be invited to the committee to address the content of her report on the Lost at Sea scheme.  The issue is very simple.  It is about whether any citizen can have confidence in the fact that if he or she makes a complaint to the Ombudsman and where he or she makes an adjudication that the recommendation is adhered to.  In this case somebody made a complaint to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman made a recommendation that was subsequently rejected by the Government.  If the Ombudsman has placed the reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas that is a very serious matter and has serious implications for the faith the State can have in the Office of the Ombudsman and whether the citizen can reliably make a complaint and have confidence in that office.</p>, <p eid="para_29">The Ombudsman should be given the opportunity to appear before this committee to facilitate an exchange of views and a question and answer session on the contents of her report.  It is totally inadequate that we had a scenario whereby we had statements in the Dáil because that did not facilitate a process where I, as a member of this House, could have had time to question the Ministers involved in this process.  It was a set piece and as a process it was fundamentally flawed.  The only way we can address that is by giving the Ombudsman an opportunity to present herself to the committee to allow us have a proper discussion on the contents of the report.</p>, <p eid="para_30">In terms of the way the State works it is a sad day if we choose as a democratic body to ignore the findings of the Ombudsman's report because it will have implications for any citizen who makes a complaint in the future.  We should tread carefully on an issue such as this one.</p>]
[<p eid="para_66">On a point of order, I reject any contention by any Member of the House that I am seeking to politicise this issue.  What is at the heart of this issue is the facilitation of the Ombudsman to allow her expand on her own report.  All that I ask is that she would be facilitated to expand on her report in this committee.  She has not been given that opportunity and I am merely requesting, devoid of any political motivation, that she be given that opportunity.  This is a serious matter, regardless of the political party one is a member of, when the Houses of the Oireachtas are furnished with her report.  That is a rejection of the report and we are merely seeking an opportunity for the Ombudsman to present her findings to this committee.  I have questions about the Lost at Sea report which I wish to pose to her in a public forum such as this.  All I ask is that she be afforded that opportunity.  I will not be accused of politicising this issue by a Member of the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">I respectfully propose that we do not open up this debate now.  The issue here is the motion before us and whether we agree to it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">I formally second that motion.  In so doing, I agree that some opportunity must be afforded to the Ombudsman so that we can fulfil our democratic functions, as well as allowing her an opportunity to present the findings of the report as part of such an investigation.  I hereby second the motion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_149">I apologise that I must leave to deal with the Fines Bill in the Dáil.</p>]
