[<p eid="para_428">In response to the Ministers present, it is fair to say that we all have this country's interests at heart.  In terms of the debates that have been facilitated by this House, it is right, proper and pertinent that Opposition Members would hold the Government to account on its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the WTO negotiations and that the Government would not take any pertinent questions from this side of the House as a slight, given that we all have as our best interests the future interests of Irish agriculture and Irish agribusiness.</p>, <p eid="para_429">By way of response to the speech of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, I wish to clear up the notion that she seemed to convey on the issue of the single farm payments.  It is our clear understanding that to convey the impression somehow that the single farm payments will be undermined and that she is endeavouring to save them under the WTO agreements under the green box issues, is something of a misnomer.  My understanding is that they are not part of the WTO negotiations in any event and to say they are conveys the wrong impression.</p>]
[<p eid="para_431">The fundamental question that we must ask ourselves today is what the Doha Round will mean for Irish agriculture and for farm families who form the bedrock of our rural society.  The WTO is informed by a <i>modus operandi</i> that seeks, with the World Bank and the IMF, a global market devoid of trade barriers.  Since 2001, at Doha, the WTO has embarked on a strategy of liberalisation of global trade resulting in a view, by countries such as our own and, I might add, poorer countries, that the indiscriminate liberalisation agenda will be detrimental to our interests and the interests of poorer countries seeking to raise their economic output.</p>, <p eid="para_432">For the purposes of analysing the Government's amendment to this motion, there is absolutely nothing in its response that would give solace to the thousands of farmers who today had to leave their homesteads in the quest to have their voices heard.</p>, <p eid="para_433">Our critique of the current Doha Round is simple.  The WTO is not on the correct path to deliver worldwide economic prosperity.  It will not raise the economic tide of all comers and, from this island's point of view, will have a disastrous effect on the rural economy and agricultural sector.  Moreover, it will decimate the Common Agricultural Policy, to which we all subscribe and which has been negotiated by a process of pooled sovereignty of EU member states through many years of diplomacy.</p>, <p eid="para_434">All of us recognise the primacy of agricultural negotiations and this sector has become an easy target for the EU Commission in its quest to gain concessions on a neoliberal trade agenda because of the subsidisation of agriculture.  Our view is simple.  To use developing countries as a bargaining chip to unravel CAP is a disingenuous argument and one to which we do not subscribe.  It is our analysis that concessions will be fought for on agricultural issues as a substitute for agreement on the liberalisation of services.  Developing countries rightly argue that it is unfair to expect them to open their markets on services while clear barriers to entry exist amongst developed countries on the provision of services.  The key worry for services liberalisation is what it means for the ability to regulate foreign service-based companies operating in less developed regions.</p>, <p eid="para_435">Furthermore, the availability of micro-credit in Africa has had the positive effect of lifting tens of millions of small farmers out of poverty.  An agrarian revolution is taking place in Africa about which one will not hear on radio or TV.  Our concern is that the growth of urban populations in Africa, which are fed through the rural African economy, may be compromised in the quest to achieve a rate of liberalisation, which may be detrimental to their economic interests.  Therein lies the comparison with the Irish farmer.  While the Irish farmer relies on the subsidisation of agriculture, the African farmer relies on a new system of micro-credit which may allow him to survive, and even in time, flourish.</p>, <p eid="para_436">In that context, Ireland and developing countries are united in their opposition to the Doha round, albeit for differing reasons.  To state that our interests are somehow detrimental to those of developing countries is a naked lie which must be firmly nailed.  To say that we are being protectionist and self-interested is true.  We should not be afraid to state that we as a nation must ensure the primacy of agriculture as an integral part of our society and any attempt to diminish hard-fought gains on CAP must be resisted at ministerial level.</p>, <p eid="para_437">A fairer global trading system is something we all want.  Any agreement should also encompass bilateral deals in which the EU is engaged, particularly with the poorest and most vulnerable economies through economic partnership agreements.  As we in Ireland look at the potential cost of cuts in tariffs, the poorest countries are being asked to eliminate more than 80% of their tariffs by the EU.  There is no equity in that proposal which signals a bad deal for both developing countries and developed countries such as Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_438">Global food security is an issue that not only effects those who are more prone to adverse weather conditions but also this island.  If it advances, this deal will compromise the food security of this nation.  The African farmer may also be left with a stark choice if this process is to succeed as envisaged by the EU Commission.  The African farmer may find himself at the end of a trade liberalisation agenda that forces him to buy his seed from a conglomerate such as Monsanto, thereby risking his livelihood, chaining him to another form of bonded labour and potentially compromising his biodiversity.</p>, <p eid="para_439">Doha and the WTO failed to consider the cultural and societal permutations of ramming this deal down our throats.  If it succeeds, we can wave goodbye to a traditional way of living.  Those farmers who are able to acquire more land and develop economies of scale will flourish and the traditional farm family will no longer exist.  I may be accused of expounding rhetoric but the implication of this deal will be a flight from the land.  This will be due to the influx of cheaper imports devoid of any controls, standards or traceability.</p>, <p eid="para_440">The Doha round is predicated on a globalisation agenda.  It relies on unrestricted global market forces.  In this scenario, transnational corporations will commandeer advantageous terms of trade.  Small local interests will no longer be able to secure, control or protect market share.  Co-operatives will be swallowed up by larger food multiples and the "Tescofication" of agriculture will become the norm.  When these larger food multiples control the means of production, they will control the price the consumer pays and the price the producer derives.  We have already arrived at this scenario, albeit on a smaller scale.</p>, <p eid="para_441">The structure of an unaccountable WTO rule-making militates against the small producer, be he or she European or African.  The structures give an advantage to large corporations and foreign direct investors at the cost of weakening the traditional equity-orientated economic programmes such as CAP, from which we as an island have benefited.</p>]
[<p eid="para_443">If the rules governing ownership of companies are changed, we will not see a company from a lesser developed region acquiring a firm from a developed country.</p>, <p eid="para_444">I thought I had 15 minutes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_446">Have I already reached the 15-minute mark?</p>]
[<p eid="para_448">I am only at ten minutes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_450">I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>, <p eid="para_451">In reality, these shoddy proposals will bring major changes in the market structures of developing countries in terms of ownership.  It is our view that trade liberalisation will transform subsistence farming into arid export monocultures, stifle the power of micro-credit and put poor countries at the mercy of western countries such as the US.  Furthermore, the price sensitivity of markets will be more keenly felt.</p>, <p eid="para_452">In essence, the WTO proposals as they currently stand are overly ambitious in terms of trade liberalisation and rule implementation.  Developing countries, as well as this country, rightly fear that they have nothing to gain from this deal.  We feel that we have made enough concessions and have gained nothing in return.  If this is the case, it is then clear that the process has failed both ourselves and lesser developed countries and is, therefore, unworkable in its current terms.  Contiguous to the analysis arrived at in recent weeks is the notion that perhaps no deal is better than a bad deal.  This is something that needs to be teased out in greater detail.</p>, <p eid="para_453">The EU Commission agenda is detrimental to both Irish agriculture and agriculture in developing countries.  The Irish farming position is one which has genuine fears about cuts to beef and dairy tariffs.  The question is whether enough support is evident at Council of Ministers level for such a cut.  If this is the case, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has questions to answer about whether she feels this is a tenable position and if not, what her counter argument is and if there is a sufficient blocking minority to force a rethink on this deal.</p>, <p eid="para_454">There are no grounds for believing that Pascal Lamy can push through a deal ahead of the meeting of Agriculture Ministers on 19 May.  As I understand it, the Doha agenda is unpopular and there are question marks over whether the end of the Bush regime in the US will signal any mood for a deal in advance of a new president being appointed.</p>, <p eid="para_455">It is our view that, while guaranteeing food security for EU citizens is a priority and this can best be achieved through a combination of supporting EU food production and through imports set in the framework of the WTO rules, this food security also depends on the EU's contribution to the building up of world stocks, which are today dramatically low.  This allows the EU not only to protect itself against shortages but also to take responsibility with regards to global food security.</p>, <p eid="para_456">We must take cognisance of the need to protect the farmers of Europe, including Irish farmers, against a liberalisation agenda that will ultimately compromise Irish comparative advantage in both the beef and dairy sector and will add nothing of value to developing countries' terms of trade.  Our view is one which unashamedly seeks to protect the national interest.  In seeking to do so, we are protecting our economy, particularly the rural economy, and a way of life that is under threat.  Commissioner Mandelson has an agenda which is incongruous with the founding principles of the European Union on issues of subsidiarity and its position as a Community-based trading bloc.  We are now left with an appalling scenario whereby the Mandelson agenda is totally at variance with that of certain members of the Council of Ministers, including our Minister.  The Commission must take its mandate from the Council of Ministers.  It must not exceed its mandate.  It is a supra-national organisation and it must derive its negotiating stance from the Minister and her colleagues.  The Minister has a hard task, therefore, in building the alliance of interests that is necessary to protect our interests.</p>, <p eid="para_457">We cannot and must not trade away the rural economy at a time when other sectors of the economy have been undermined.  The agribusiness sector is the one that has remained constant through thick and thin throughout the history of the State.  It is the sector that will always be there.  If we are to trade away the concessions that have been hard won through tough negotiations and diplomacy, all those concessions will have been in vain.</p>]
