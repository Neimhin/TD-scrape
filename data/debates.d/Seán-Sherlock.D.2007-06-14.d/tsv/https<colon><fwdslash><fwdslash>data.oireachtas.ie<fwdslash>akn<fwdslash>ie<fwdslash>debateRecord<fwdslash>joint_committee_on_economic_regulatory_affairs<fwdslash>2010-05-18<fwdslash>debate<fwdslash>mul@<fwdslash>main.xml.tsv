[<p eid="para_53">I welcome our guests.  This is the first occasion on which the issue of regulation has been presented to the committee on a pounds, shillings and pence basis.  We have received a micro view of how regulation has affected the sector.  I was particularly intrigued by Mr. Foy's story in respect of potatoes.  From a layman's point of view, I wish to discover more about the regime which allows someone to enter a shop and rip open a bag of potatoes and examine the contents.</p>, <p eid="para_54">What power is bestowed on inspectors from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which allows them to do this in the first instance?  Surely it must be possible for these people to take a step back from their own regulatory regime and visit wholesalers in order to inspect goods.  I imagine they are doing this in an event in respect of eggs, tobacco and the other items to which our guests refer.  If they visit the premises of wholesalers or primary producers, why then are they also visiting independent grocers in order to inspect the same products?  Do our guests have a view on that matter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">Mr. Foy has been based in Cootehill for ten years.  The Department's inspectors have been checking the potatoes on sale at his premises for that entire period and I presume a situation has at some point arisen where they stated that those potatoes were substandard or that certain actions needed to be taken.  I do not wish to sound flippant, I merely wish to discover whether such a bizarre scenario exists in the first instance.</p>]
[<p eid="para_58">I accept that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_61">The HACCP legislation, even though it applies on a Europe-wide basis, arguably would not allow for the situation to which Mr. Foy referred in respect of Starbucks.  We implement and accommodate European legislation and HACCP regulations relating to food in as robust a fashion as possible.  I do not know if any of our guests' stores are affected by the HACCP legislation.  If it does affect them, will they indicate whether that affect is adverse in nature?  It is well documented that if one visits a country market or artisan store in France, it is obvious that those stallholders and store owners do not adhere to the legislation in the way retailers here are obliged to do.  What is our guests' view on that matter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_63">We need to return to first principles, exercise a degree of common sense and deconstruct the culture whereby everything needs to be examined and jobs need to be created for the sake of doing so.</p>]
[<p eid="para_65">A high-level group is examining the position with regard to regulation at present.  Is RGDATA providing that group with information?</p>]
[<p eid="para_67">Okay.  ISME and the SFA have come before the committee and a common theme runs through our deliberations, namely, that there is far too much regulation and that it must be reduced.  I would argue that the high-level group to which I refer is understaffed and that its work is not moving at an acceptable pace.  This committee should take a view to the effect that RGDATA should play a more formal role in respect of the high-level group.  I hope other members agree with me in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_68">What are our guests advocating in respect of requests for statistics from the CSO?  Everyone agrees that the CSO is necessary, particularly as there is a need for statistics.  However, perhaps there is a need to consider what it is doing in seeking statistics from the grocery sector at the level to which our guests refer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_70">We could take a representative sample.</p>]
[<p eid="para_73">It seems to be more of a quantitative exercise than a qualitative exercise.</p>]
[<p eid="para_76">What is coming across is that we need to apply some common sense.  The witnesses are arguing for something quite logical.</p>, <p eid="para_77">My last question does not relate to what the witnesses presented.  The regional planning guidelines are under review.  I have a strong view on what I call the "Tescofication" of the grocery sector.  Pressure is coming from the larger multiples for a change to regional planning guidelines.  Does RGDATA have a formal view on this?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">I would like to take Mr. Nolan up on the offer.</p>]
