SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:00:00+00:00	I welcome the representative groups and thank them for their time. I am trying to reconcile the gap between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the individual member of a credit union, as represented by these groups today. If I start with Consultation Paper 76 - or CP76 - my understanding was that the representative organisations made specific proposals on tiered regulation. I note the point made by Mr. Tim Molan of CUMA earlier:Tiered regulation, proportionate to the scale and risk in each credit union, has not been delivered. This was a key deliverable of the commission report. Consultation and engagement have been less consistent and transparent than was originally envisaged … Where consultation has been triggered, sector views have often been ignored, as was the case with CP88.I want to drill further into that dynamic. I read the speech by the registrar of credit unions to the CUMA spring conference. Objectively, one would think that, from a regulatory point of view, the issues raised by her in that speech seem to apply to many credit unions. If there are still outliers in the system that are not ticking all the regulatory boxes from a legislative point of view, should they be dealt in one parcel, while those credit unions, whether they are large or involved in the hub-and-spoke model, are allowed to progress into areas such as payment accounts, debit cards, longer term lending and investment in social housing? Is it the case that the Central Bank is trying to apply a one-size-fits-all approach? If that is the case, will that hamper the ability of the credit union movement to progress in lending for productive, social and other purposes?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:00:00+00:00	Does that involve a change to one of the sections of the legislation or does it involve a change in the culture within the Central Bank regarding how it views credit unions?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:00:00+00:00	That is a question which should be posed to the registrar as one of the workings of this interaction when she is before the committee on Thursday. I read her speech to the CUMA conference in which she addressed issues such as everyday payment accounts. She stated:[T]he market is not large enough to support multiple offerings of the same products and services, but that limit is not one confined to one service model. So far, we have not received any formal applications beyond MPCAS, although our sectoral engagement suggests that this is an area of active interest.If the credit union movement is talking about innovating and the potential for payment accounts, how does that work its way through the system? What does that mean from the credit union movement's perspective?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:10:00+00:00	Mr. McCrory has moved on to AGMs. On that issue, I understand that quite a few AGMs have not taken place and that sanction is needed for an AGM to take place. Why is this the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:10:00+00:00	I wish to broaden the perspectives on these issues with Mr. Johnson, Mr. Molan and even Ms O'Connor who should forgive me as we have not included her in the interaction yet. We are trying to get a better understanding of this. As I said, it is still about the gaps that exist. Mr. McCrory has already articulated a gap in respect of CP88 and spoken about the indefinite delays in the holding of AGMs. What the average member wants to know is why this is the case. How do we close this gap? The theme of the registrar's speech was "Mind the Gap". She referred to:- Your current v. your needed level of regulatory compliance. Given some of the issues we have found in recent supervisory engagements, I could characterize this as "Mind the basics", and- the sector's current business model and capability, and the ambitious proposed or evolving business models, which often carry very much different risks and capabilities.There is then still a massive gap between how the registrar perceives the Credit Union Managers Association and how the organisation perceives itself. Somewhere in between, we are trying to see if we can broker or mediate that gap, and in broad terms there seems to be a long way to go. On the face of it, the registrar seems, if I am reading the speech correctly, to put a major limit on the issue of the payment accounts and debit cards. She seems to suggest a major curbing of one's enthusiasm, for want of a better expression, in respect of long-term lending. She is very reticent, if I interpret her correctly - and she will have a chance to respond to these comments on Thursday - on the investment in social housing. In addition, I have a difficulty understanding the issues regarding section 35. No review has yet been undertaken, even though we are technically out of recession, on the section 35 rescheduling restrictions because individual impacted members - and this is based on anecdotal evidence - are back in work and have continuing borrowing requirements in excess of the emergency amounts allowed under the regulations. Again, the question on my mind is whether it takes a legislative change to amend this or whether a cultural change is needed within the Central Bank to broker that. I hope that makes sense.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:10:00+00:00	Tiered regulation is what is needed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:10:00+00:00	That is the message we need to hear in a very unambiguous way, and it is coming across clearly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-21T17:10:00+00:00	In other words, if there is an outlier who does not fit all the criteria vis-à-vis regulation, in a one-tier system of regulation one cannot develop new business models or innovate. I think that is the core message we are getting from the witnesses.
