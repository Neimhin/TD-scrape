[<p eid="para_39">I too welcome the Commissioner.  It is heartening to see him and to hear his views.  It is important that we hear those views and that he gets some sense of the Irish position.  I am a member of the Labour Party, which is on the left, and it should be worth noting that our party would take the view that the envelope must be preserved if possible.  The justification for that is that if there is a growth in the global population from 6 billion to 9 billion between now and 2050, depending on which figures one believes — it is a massive rate of growth nonetheless — then the challenges for the European Union bloc will be to feed itself and to export.</p>, <p eid="para_40">We import approximately €78 billion in food imports, therefore it seems to me that the logical position, notwithstanding the economic downturns we face at the current time, is that we must ramp up investment in ensuring that we can have a market for foodstuffs and that we can guarantee that we avoid the food scarcity the Commissioner spoke about.</p>, <p eid="para_41">The Irish model of agriculture is one whereby the public goods are built in, in the sense of the quality of the output and much work has been done in recent years in regard to  environmental measures and so on.  I am encouraged by what the Commissioner said regarding direct payments when he said they are crucial and that it will be an evolution and not a revolution.  There is concern here, particularly when we face such a massive deficit in the public finances, that if there is a major retrenchment in the agricultural model or agrifood sector, it could further undermine an area where there is great potential for growth.  If we look at theburgeoning Asian middle classes, where certain tastes have developed, we are well placed to meet significant demand for food exports.  We need the assistance, however, to carry out that multiplier and if there is retrenchment in the envelope, it could impede our prospects.</p>, <p eid="para_42">We are mindful that the Commissioner faces challenges with our eastern European neighbours.  They will be ironed out in due course but if we are talking about global food scarcity and the massive increases in global population, if we can preserve the envelope, we will be well placed to benefit and to add value to the EU bloc.</p>]
