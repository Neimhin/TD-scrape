SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The target is 85 per annum reaching approximately 100 per annum up to 2016 and beyond.  One cannot give a definitive figure because many variables enter into the fray, including intellectual property and commercialisation of research, but the most important point is that we are in a space where we are seeking to spin out as many companies as possible on an indigenous basis.  I believe the number for last year was 31.  One would hope to see that increasing but on the high potential start-ups, the target is 85 reaching a final target of approximately 100 per year from 2016.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I had a meeting with Mr. Cunningham yesterday.  The budget line is important because the event, which will take place in mid-July next year, will attract researchers and persons within the scientific community at the highest level to our shores.  This is a pan-European win, so to speak.  The fact that we were able to win that competition against stiff competition from places like Vienna is a good testament to where we stand within that global scientific community.That win and this investment is vital in terms of our reputation because in enabling us to attract top level researchers we are sending out further signals into the research and science field.  That will result in added wins for us in the future.  We will gain from it by virtue of its profiling in the first instance.  The programme is comprehensive and intensive.  It will roll out across the State over the 12 months but will be focused primarily within those four or five days.  The fact that there will be industry involvement and all of the stakeholders involved over those four or five days will ensure we will be able to lay a further foundation or ramp it up, so to speak, to ensure we can make further gains in this field ultimately in terms of foreign direct investment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	One way of looking at the overall picture it is to consider the level of FDI in 2003, for example.  In that year, the proportion of IDA client wins with a research and development component was approximately 10%, valued at €120 million.  In 2009-10, some 50% of FDI was research and development investment and it was valued at €500 million.  That is one important metric upon which we can work.If one considers the budget for Science Foundation Ireland, €15.3 million, and the collaboration involving over 500 companies on joint research initiatives, one will note the arrangement supports €73 billion in exports.  It is a valuable component but we need to consider further how many indigenous companies we can spin out.  We must consider whether there is a value to continuing with the investment in the centres of excellence and research clusters.  I believe there is because it maintains a vital FDI component because of the collaborations with industry.  One must take cognisance of the investment in basic research because, if we do not continue to invest in basic and applied research, we will not be able to achieve the spin-outs in the medium to longer term.  We need to ensure we get the balance right between the investment in basic and applied research, maintaining Science Foundation Ireland investment through the clusters and centres of excellence and trying to set metrics or targets.Progressing from basic research into the commercialisation field remains a challenge.  We must ask where it is best for the State to invest.  This conversation is taking place and will continue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The hosting of the event will cost €6 million.  The Exchequer contribution over the period 2009 to 2012 is to be €2.973 million.  The funding provided for 2011 is based on the 2009 decision by the previous Government.  One will not know the wins until the event takes place; they cannot be projected.  We want to use the event as a showcase for Irish science and research across all the disciplines.Let us consider the next EU framework programme, which I am told should be called Horizon 2020 rather than Framework 8.  If we are involved in this programme in its early stages, we will be able to influence funding lines by virtue of the enhanced reputation we hope to gain as a result of the hosting the event, which will attract top researchers and scientists from across the world.  There will be a win for tourism in that 5,000 delegates will be brought to the Convention Centre Dublin.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	There is potential for delegates to spend up to €4.8 million, according to one estimate, and to raise €1.1 million in taxation.  There is a win by virtue of holding the event itself but there will be a further medium-term gain because of the reputation enhancement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	To what is the Deputy referring?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I might have to revert to the Deputy on that.  I have no explanation for that at present.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Forgive me for not being able to answer in the first instance.  The figure of €8.5 million includes a new programme of €2.5 million born from the enterprise platform programme which was transferred from Department of Education and Skills.  It is funded from current funds.  I can get Deputy O'Dea a more comprehensive explanation in writing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	A total of 20 companies and eight research groups won new contracts for 2010 amounting to €10 million.  There is a return on the investment.  I visited a company, SensL, in Cork recently, which is doing work in this space.  The subhead supports indigenous industries and start-ups.  One would have had a healthy scepticism about this.  I believe we are getting the return on the investments.
