SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T10:30:00+00:00	I do not wish to cut across the Deputy. On the same issue, three of my questions have been ruled out of order. They relate to Operation Freeflow, the budget lines for the new Garda operational divisions and the number of community gardaí. I have been told these are operational matters for the Garda, but they are also issues of Government policy and matters about which the Government speaks very strongly. I am frustrated that these priority questions have been ruled out of order.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T10:30:00+00:00	The questions also relate to policy matters.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T10:30:00+00:00	I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for allowing me to interject.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T10:50:00+00:00	The question is self-explanatory. How many times has the Garda air support unit been used in each of the years from 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019? What was the reason for deployment and the cost involved for each deployment? From what areas were funds obtained? I seek a perspective from the Minister regarding the use of this service.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T11:00:00+00:00	I thank the Minister for his reply. We all agree that this is an invaluable service that we would wish to see further resourced if possible. Do the vast bulk of those deployments take place in the Dublin metropolitan area? Is there scope for extending the deployment of the resource to a more diverse geographical area, including the south, south west, west and north west of the country, particularly in light of the current strain on policing in some of those regions? When events such as music or sporting festivals take place, where thousands of people gather, is there any interaction between An Garda Síochána and the event promoters regarding the costs borne by the State for the provision of those services?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-20T11:00:00+00:00	I appreciate the Minister's reply. We all agree that it is an invaluable service. I welcome the fact that the Minister will provide some information on the geographical spread of those deployments.
