[<p eid="para_83">We need to take cognisance that the Minister of State must speak authoritatively about the design and promulgation of a scheme which predates his membership of the House.  On one level and with a degree of equity, one must recognise it is difficult for him to speak with some authority on the scheme's good parts and flaws several years after it has finished.</p>, <p eid="para_84">Having said that, there is nothing new in what the Minister of State has said today.  With respect to him, I must conclude he is following the line of his Department's Secretary General, which he acknowledged in his opening statement.  When the committee was seeking witnesses to the lost at sea scheme, the obvious move was to request the current Minister with responsibility for fisheries to attend the committee.  However, it is not surprising he has followed the same line.  Who among us would not do so in a particular set of circumstances?</p>, <p eid="para_85">The issue for the Labour Party is whether this committee will support the Ombudsman's findings in her special report laid before the Oireachtas that there was maladministration or administration contrary to sound and fair principles of the scheme in question.  The other issue is whether the Byrne family has a legitimate case in their complaint about the scheme to the Ombudsman.</p>, <p eid="para_86">My view, and that of the Labour Party, is that they have a legitimate case.  However, it is clear from the Minister of State's submission he has made up his mind, along the same lines as the Minister and the Secretary General, that there is no case to answer.  The Government will, therefore, run contrary to the Ombudsman's view.</p>, <p eid="para_87">If the Oireachtas is to give due regard to the Ombudsman's independent role, it must respect the findings of any report she lays before the House.  If any citizen is to have confidence in making a complaint to the Ombudsman, the right option is for the Oireachtas to accept her findings, the independence of her office and move on.</p>, <p eid="para_88">Deputy Bobby Aylward took the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">That may be the case but I have heard nothing today from the Minister of State to suggest there has been any shift in the Government's position.  Instead, all I have seen is a further entrenchment of its position as to how it proposes to deal with this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_92">I do not but I am entitled to use my time.  I do not believe my asking questions would serve any purpose today.  I have asked every possible question on this matter over the past several days.  I do not believe the Minister of State is going to add anything further to what is known already.</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">With all due respect, it does not matter what the committee decides.  Ultimately, the decision rests with the Government and the Minister has already made his case.  Even if the committee decides to support unanimously the Ombudsman's report, it is clear from the Minister of State's statement today that the Government has already decided its position.  Let us call a spade a spade.</p>]
