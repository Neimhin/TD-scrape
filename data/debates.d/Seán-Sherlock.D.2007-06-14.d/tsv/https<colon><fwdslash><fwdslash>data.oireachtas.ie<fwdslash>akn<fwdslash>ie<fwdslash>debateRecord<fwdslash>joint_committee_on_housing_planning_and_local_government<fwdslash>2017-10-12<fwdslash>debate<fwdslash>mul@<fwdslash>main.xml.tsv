SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-12T10:00:00+01:00	I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for giving me a hearing today. The Bill is self-explanatory. Microbeads and other microplastics are used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products such as scrubs, soaps, lotions and toothpastes. They are added to these products to make the product more abrasive or for decoration. The Bill is a follow-on Bill based on a Green Party Bill put forward by Senator Grace O'Sullivan. I acknowledge the role of the Green Party in bringing forward the issue in the first instance. Our Bill seeks to follow on from that and to strengthen the Bill to allow for us to legislate. Section 2 provides for the prohibition of microplastics. It provides that a person who manufactures, sells, exposes, offers, advertises, keeps for sale, imports or attempts to import into the State for sale any cosmetic containing microplastics is guilty of an offence. A cosmetic is defined as meaning any cosmetic or personal care product, including but not limited to facial scrubs, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste. Microplastic is defined as meaning plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter. The section provides that a person guilty of an offence is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment of 12 months or both and, on conviction on indictment, to a fine or imprisonment for five years or both. Provision is made for the liability of directors, managers, secretaries etc. of corporate bodies where they consent to or connive in the commission of an offence by the corporate body. The section provides that it is a defence for an accused person to prove he or she did not know and had no reason to suspect the cosmetic in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed contained microplastics.  That is it in a nutshell. I have brought forward my Bill on the basis that I believe the State should move to legislate. I understand the Government stated its intention to legislate on an earlier Stage. On Second Stage of the Bill such a commitment was made. I have not had sight of any Government proposal to legislate for the prohibition of microplastics yet. I am hopeful we can keep this issue on the agenda. If the Government is to legislate for this and if we see the heads of a Bill coming from Government, I would be very happy to withdraw or amend my legislation. Until such time as that happens, I hope to keep the Bill on the agenda. If the Second Stage debate is anything to go by, it is something on which there is a willingness across party political lines to legislate for and to be seen as taking leadership on globally, given we are a maritime nation. The scourge of microplastics is something that is having untold health consequences for sea life. We now have evidence that it is finding its way into the food chain. It is quite an important issue. I am hopeful the committee will retain the legislation or allow for safe passage of the legislation. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-12T10:10:00+01:00	There may be a defence by the Government on this to the effect that there are Single Market implications for the introduction of legislation of this nature. I appreciate that the then Minister communicated with Commissioner Vella. I am not sure what the status of that interaction is at present but there is a precedent when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Miche√°l Martin, introduced the smoking ban. It could have been argued at that time that it could have run contrary to some of the treaty provisions relating to the Single Market but as it was subsequently deemed successful as a measure, the same could apply here. The important point is that a number of countries have signed up to the principle of banning microplastics. This goes as far back as December 2014 in respect of the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden. A joint press statement was released by these countries calling for the ban and the political willingness is there. Regarding the communication from the Commission, I have not seen a legislative proposal or Commission proposal as of yet regarding this issue. It may be there; I may have missed it. However, I believe, as Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, that there is a strong willingness within the community for Ireland to take a lead on that and that is the main purpose of the legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-10-12T10:10:00+01:00	I do not have any specific information about what is happening in other countries throughout the EU. I am basing my legislation very much on policy and principles and am seeking to find a mechanism through the Irish Legislature as to how we can design robust legislation for this issue. I have a very open mind about this. I would be quite happy were the Government to decide to take my legislation and to amend it significantly to allow for legislative passage of the Bill. I would very much welcome a further deliberation, if necessary, by this committee on some of those questions. If the committee decided that it was necessary to have further deliberations with outside persons such as experts in the field, I would be very happy to take part in that. This Bill seeks to strengthen the Green Party Bill because the rebuttal by Government of that Bill was on the basis that it could run contrary to Single Market or treaty provisions. We have built into the legislation what we hope is a strengthening of that. A research report commissioned by the Commission in January 2016 stated it was unclear as to whether any of the existing directives or regulations that had been identified would be suitable. The EU is in a space at present where it has not come to a definitive position on this. It seems to be an iterative process. There is a school of thought that says that the Canadian and US legislation may not necessarily be transferable to an EU scenario. I have no doubt that there are challenges to passing this legislation but if we can move to the principle of the legislation and if this House decides that it wants to legislate for this, we can find ways of doing so.
