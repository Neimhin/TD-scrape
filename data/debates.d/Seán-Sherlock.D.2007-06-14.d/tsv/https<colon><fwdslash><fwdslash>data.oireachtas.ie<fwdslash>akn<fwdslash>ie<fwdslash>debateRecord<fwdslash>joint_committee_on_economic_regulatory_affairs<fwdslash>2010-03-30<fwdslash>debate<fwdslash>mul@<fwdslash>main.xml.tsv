[<p eid="para_26">I welcome the former Registrar of Credit Unions.  He is certainly not pulling any punches, which we welcome.  Sometimes what is needed is plain language.  Is Mr. Logue aware that the Central Bank Reform Bill has been published?  What are his views on the section 35 issues we have been addressing here in recent weeks?</p>, <p eid="para_27">Mr. Logue's submission referred to the appointment of officers through the AGM.  Is he suggesting that there should be changes to that mechanism?  While he will forgive me if I am misinterpreting what he said, perhaps his view is that the person appointed is the lowest common denominator, but he or she might not always be the right person for a job on a board.  Any credit union board member I have ever met was appointed because he or she has a significant body of experience and knows his or her individual credit union intimately.  Is he suggesting that there should be a regulatory framework for the appointment of particular officers to boards and that there should be rules governing that?  I know there will be in-house rules.  Stemming from that, the voluntary nature of credit unions is such that I would have certain concerns if we were to apply barriers to entry for certain persons by virtue of the fact that they do not hold certain financial qualifications.  At the same time I have an open mind on it.</p>, <p eid="para_28">The committee has been offered differing views on the reporting mechanism for the Registrar of Credit Unions.  One view is that the regulatory framework for credit unions should be housed under a Department.  Another view is that it should be housed under the umbrella of the Central Bank of Ireland, but that the reporting mechanism should be either directly to the director or to an assistant director.  There might be sense in having a reporting procedure that ensures that within the regulatory office under the umbrella of the Central Bank of Ireland there would be a board that contains experts in the credit union field to which each of the credit unions or each of the bodies would then report.  It seems that within the Financial Regulator's office there might have been a dearth of intimate knowledge on the workings of the credit unions.  It is fair to say that Mr. Logue's role as registrar was one which was quite effectual — I do not mean to plámás in saying that — in that he had a very firm hand in terms of the rules and regulations.  However, if a new regulatory regime comes in, we need to find how the credit union movement would best fit into that new regulatory regime, where it would be housed, where the reporting should be and whether there should be a separate board or body of people with specific expertise within the regulatory house under the Central Bank of Ireland to deal with credit unions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">A credit union customer of long standing, for example 20 years, who had a car loan, might lose his job and his financial circumstances would change literally overnight.  He may be paying a set amount per week over a fixed period of time.  While he might default on one or two of those payments he might take responsibility and go in to visit his credit union manager.  If that loan can be stretched out for a longer period of time on a reduced payment on the proviso that he will honour his commitments, is that not part of the credit union ethos?  It allows for a degree of flexibility and there is an element of trust.  By and large the ratio of impairments for credit union customers is probably negligible — I do not have exact figures.  However, where a degree of flexibility is shown, the likelihood is that the loan will be repaid albeit over a period of time, by relaxing the section 35 provisions the credit union would take cognisance of the realities of the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_33">If Mr. Logue agrees with the changes to section 35 and takes flexibility into account how can he address that in the accounting procedures to ensure there is no profligacy and that he keeps a tight stricture on those same procedures?</p>]
[<p eid="para_39">God forbid.</p>]
[<p eid="para_43">Is Mr. Logue referring specifically to the amendment to the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order that allowed credit unions to invest in such investments?  There was a relaxing of the order in, I believe, 2006 which if I am not mistaken allowed credit unions to undertake such investments.  It could be argued that this change to the regulation, although it did not exactly force credit unions to invest outside their normal investment vehicles, meant that if they wanted to do so this was perhaps the only way for them to go.  It is one school of thought.  I do not necessarily say I subscribe to it myself.</p>]
