SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-02-09T14:30:00+00:00	I join the welcome to the Minister. My first question relates specifically to the Minister's intervention where he stated that he had agreed a safeguard clause to Brexit-proof letters of offer to programme beneficiaries. Could he flesh out that statement and tell us exactly what it means in relation to securing funding lines for the very programmes he talks about? The second issue I wish to raise relates to Horizon 2020. I am encouraged by the fact that the Minister made specific reference to it. He might indicate what the permutations might be for Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, funded programmes whereby the legislative base within the Twenty-six Counties is such that the remit of SFI allows it to fund researchers in the North and the South. I am concerned that when the United Kingdom exits the European Union, it will put this island at a disadvantage when it comes to accessing the Horizon 2020 funding pot because, to all intents and purposes, there are two jurisdictions which can collaborate to access funding from the main source. Has the Government given any thought to what the permutations will be in seeking science funding and for the island of Ireland in reaching the stated target in accessing the Horizon 2020 funding pot? Has the Government, not specifically the Minister, engaged with Science Foundation Ireland on having a co-ordinated view on the research infrastructure which is vital in supporting thousands of jobs, North and South? What is the Minister's general view on that issue? We are all following the passage of the legislation before the House of Commons. I understand the opposition tabled an amendment, No. 86, to require Article 50 not break to anything agreed to in the Good Friday Agreement, to put it loosely. I understand the amendment was defeated by a majority of 39. Therefore, de facto, the Tories defeated the amendment. I am concerned about this. Is the Government watching the legislation from that vantage point? Does it have a strong view that sufficient attention is being given by the UK Government to the Good Friday Agreement? If the UK Government is defeating simple amendments of this nature, it may speak to a certain attitude that would concern me.
