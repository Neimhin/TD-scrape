SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-01-21T14:30:00+00:00	Deputy Lawlor raised the point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T14:30:00+00:00	I can wait until he comes back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	I will wait until he comes back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:50:00+00:00	The Government remains committed to the vision of using research and innovation to generate jobs and growth.  That is the fundamental philosophy underscoring our efforts in this area.  The 2014 science and technology programme budgets have been maintained at the 2013 levels, which will support this goal.  Within the constraints of our economic circumstances, we are maximising the funding available for research, development and innovation and, critically, seeking to maximise the impact of this investment on jobs and the economy.  Evidence from both the EU and internationally shows that the Government's strategy of accelerating the economic and societal return on our science, technology and innovation investment is paying off.  We are first in Europe for jobs created in research and development and tenth out of 142 countries under the global innovation index for 2013.  Ireland is in 13th position for university-industry collaboration on research and development.  We are in the top 20 in global international scientific rankings, first in molecular genetics, second in probiotics, third in immunology, sixth in nanotechnology, eighth in material science and tenth in computer science.  We are ranked third in the EU on the new indicator of innovation output, which measures the extent to which ideas from innovative sectors are able to reach the market, thereby making Europe more competitive and helping to create jobs.  The provisional figures indicate that the target to support 100 high-potential start-up businesses in 2013 has been exceeded.  These businesses have committed to creating a total of 2,100 new jobs and will generate annual sales of €300 million by 2015.  The seven new Science Foundation Ireland research centres established in 2013 will directly support 800 jobs and are a key attractant for foreign direct investment.  In 2013, Science Foundation Ireland had links to 65% of the 3,085 jobs announced by IDA Ireland in the fields covered by SFI's legal remit.  We will continue the implementation of research prioritisation as well as a range of other initiatives to deliver on our strategy, ensure a more targeted investment of science, technology and innovation, and further enhance the effectiveness and impact of our research investment, with the aim of sustaining and creating jobs across the sectors to which I referred.  This year, Science Foundation Ireland will establish two to three new large-scale research centres, which will support between 200 and 300 jobs in sectors of national strategic importance, such as medical devices, software, diagnostics, telecommunications, smart grids, and sustainable food production and processing.  SFI will also fund 3,000 researchers and more than 20 world-class research centres in 2014.  These are a key magnet for foreign direct investment and will help to ensure Ireland becomes one of the most attractive locations in Europe and globally in this regard.  Enterprise Ireland will support 95 high-potential start-up businesses in 2014 which, as I said, will yield 2,100 jobs across a range of sectors.  We are also working hard on driving greater industrial and academic collaboration.  Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will continue to promote and drive effective collaboration between the two.  The main driving force for this is the translational impact from research into economic activity.  Does the Vice Chairman wish me to address the individual subheads?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:50:00+00:00	If I understood the question correctly, it related to the various programmes that exist across the institutes of technology, through Enterprise Ireland and so on.  There is significant potential under Horizon 2020.  The negotiations on the €80 billion package were concluded during the Irish Presidency, an effort to which the team that is behind me today was integral.  Through Enterprise Ireland we have set up a national support network which will includes most of the State funders of research, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Health Research Board, Irish Research Council, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  What we have here is a set of national contact points which will liaise with the institutes of technology and with individual entities within the universities.  These are the go-to contacts for industry and academics.  We are targeting an increase in regard to the number of small and medium-sized enterprises that are engaged with programmes like Horizon 2020.  We have raised the bar up to 20% engagement in terms of a drawdown of funding.  The funding target is some €1.25 billion, which should present significant opportunities for the SME sector.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:50:00+00:00	We have put in place a technology transfer strengthening initiative, TTSI programme, which is funded through Enterprise Ireland, and there are technology transfer offices within the individual organisations.  The national intellectual property protocol deals with how industry engages with academia in terms of collaborations and how it mines that intellectual property.  There should not, therefore, be any ambiguity for anybody who wants to talk to an institute of technology or university in regard to mining those types of opportunities.There are clear protocols in that regard. The major challenge, which Deputy Lawlor touched on, relates to how we encourage those in the SME sector, particularly those who own small and, quite possibly, intergenerational businesses, to engage with the institutes of technology in the context of innovation partnerships or innovation vouchers. There may be a job of work to be done in the context of improving the profile of innovation vouchers among small businesses, particularly in the context of their value. The LEOs may be the means by which that could be done. I do not wish to be parochial but I am aware of the intimate workings of the system in Cork and I know there is quite an advanced, if informal, network in place which allows businesses to interact with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT. However, I am not sure whether this is replicated throughout the country and there may be a need for work to also be done in this regard. The net point is that larger corporations will have relationships through the Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, research centres and the technology gateway centres. The relationship in this regard is quite formalised and deep. We want to encourage the participation of more businesses which would not have interacted on this level. Such businesses could, for example, be operating in the light engineering sector and could be intergenerational in nature. Those involved with firms of this nature may be extremely intelligent people who may not have gone through the formal system of third level education, but they are still running great businesses and they possess major skill sets. These individuals may not be thinking about growing their operations in a particular way or about moving in a direction which will facilitate new innovations. There is an opportunity for Ireland to improve its position in the context of this sector. We must ensure there is a greater knowledge among people with regard to the potential of innovation vouchers. There are those who may argue about whether the level of take-up in respect of the innovation partnerships has been sufficiently high. The position with regard to take-up may relate to people aiming for the top end, maximum amount of €250,000 rather than for the minimum amount of €50,000. The latter amount could, of course, have as much of an impact as the former in the context of the industry or SME academic partnerships which are driven by Enterprise Ireland.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:00:00+00:00	It costs nothing for the owner of a business to contact his or her local institute of technology or technology gateway centre. I have with me the Technology Centre Expo 2013 booklet, which acts as a very good guide to the technology centres that exist within the institutes of technology, for example. Those centres are natural gateways for industries involved in a range of sectors, from the production of food right through to medical devices, to come on board. The key point is that the system relating to more well-established or technology-driven companies is quite advanced. What we are concerned with here is trying to get those who operate small or medium-sized businesses to start considering how they might obtain access to the information that is available. As stated, it costs nothing to get involved in a conversation. It could be argued that the walls are impenetrable. However, I am of the view that those walls are being broken down quite quickly. The Deputy would be surprised by the number of people who attended the launch of Horizon 2020. I met a man from my region who is a painter and decorator by trade and who was present at that launch to examine a business opportunity. There is a new confidence among people but we need to do more to drive business forward.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:00:00+00:00	People's experience with regard to innovation vouchers will be different. If a voucher is not working in a way that suits a particular company that is trying to drive innovation and if it is agreed, in principle, that there is scope for new innovation, then one would argue that Enterprise Ireland's suite of supports should be bought to bear in respect of that company in any event. I accept the point and it is important that Enterprise Ireland should analyse the output relating to innovation vouchers. That is certainly something which can be done.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:00:00+00:00	Yes, but one could argue that we do not necessarily want the institutes of technology or the universities to see this as a revenue stream.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:00:00+00:00	Is the Deputy referring to Horizon 2020?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T15:00:00+00:00	The Government, through Science Foundation Ireland, has effectively done a deal with industry whereby it will provide €100 million in funding and the taxpayer will provide €200 million to facilitate the roll-out of research centres. The work at one of those centres specifically relates to marine renewable energy. This will be a world-class research facility.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:00:00+00:00	We are also involved in the European Commission's Atlantic strategy, which was launched by Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn and the Taoiseach.  This strategy relates to evaluating the Atlantic's potential in the context of renewable energy and would involve countries collaborating with each other.I take the point that has been made. There are knowledge and innovation communities and various themes that have been negotiated through Horizon 2020, in particular one in which we had a specific interest that related to food and that will be rolled out soon. Countries will have to collaborate with each other along those themes anyway. In respect of Horizon 2020, those research centres will be rolled out with the idea of leveraging greater funding from the EU because of their size. By creating those economies of scale and forcing more academic institutions to collaborate with each other along thematic lines, large entities are being created that will be able to leverage opportunities from Horizon 2020 from an €80 billion fund along those themes to which the Deputy referred. In view of the two jurisdictions, we are working very closely with Northern Ireland and InterTrade Ireland to enable those concerned pitch for that kind of funding as well. There are opportunities there. I would like to know to whom the Deputy spoke.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:10:00+00:00	The system in Ireland is based on academic institutions.  There are other models like the Fraunhofer model in Germany which act as stand-alone entities.  We have the Tyndall National Institute but it is aligned to an academic institution.  I am not sure how to answer the Deputy's question other than to say that if a company is innovative and arguably has a relationship with a State agency, the chances are that if it is going to look for funding, it will already have a relationship with one of the State agencies and will find its way to one of the Enterprise Ireland or national contact points to seek those opportunities to draw down funding as per the SME targets about which I spoke earlier.  The company will already be alive to those opportunities so we do not think there is any need to change the model in that sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:10:00+00:00	We are a small country.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:10:00+00:00	What is the Deputy suggesting?  I do not understand what she is suggesting.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-21T16:10:00+00:00	If one looks at Food Health Ireland, one will see there is an alignment to a number of academic institutions.  The reason why it works here is because we have cross-collaboration between different academic institutions.  There can be more than one academic institution mapped on to a theme, which is normally the case.  If one looks at Teagasc in Moorpark or Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre in University College Cork, one can see that a number of State entities and a number of different and competing industrial partners are involved in that.  There is a mechanism to allow them to share knowledge, which is arguably a better model because it results in greater economic activity for Ireland at the end of the day.  Most companies will already have research arms with their parent companies.  The model we have in Ireland is one of Government collaborating with industry and it works.
