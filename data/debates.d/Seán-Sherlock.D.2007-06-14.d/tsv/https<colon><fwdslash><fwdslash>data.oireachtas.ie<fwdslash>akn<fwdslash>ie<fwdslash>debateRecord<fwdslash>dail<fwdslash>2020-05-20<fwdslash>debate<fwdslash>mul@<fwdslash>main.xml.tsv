SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:30:00+01:00	I will start with the quality of life issues facing working parents, particularly working mothers, for whom childcare has become a crucial issue. We have the first research findings from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on the adverse effect it is having on working women in particular. The CSO press statement on the employment and life effects of COVID-19 survey published on 13 May states:It found that more women ... than men ... are caring for a dependent family member or friend because of the COVID-19 crisis. It also found that women are more likely to report childcare issues related to the COVID-19 crisis ... and women are finding it more difficult to work from home because of family being around.We now have an evidence base to show this pandemic is having an adverse effect on working women in particular. I said this the last time I stood in the Chamber to speak to the Minister and I am saying it again today. In the intervening period, a milestone was missed. We had much expectation about this milestone being reached but it was missed. It is pertinent for us to ask why it has been missed. If there is a certain amount of scepticism about the next milestone being reached, that would be understandable by any objective analysis. I seek a cast-iron guarantee from the Government and the Minister that the next phase of this scheme will proceed on 29 June. If the Minister can give us that guarantee, will she also indicate, given that phase 1 for essential workers was missed, whether there are plans to put in place a revised scheme for the period until 29 June? Is work ongoing to devise a scheme for those who were missed in phase 1?That is the first question. I will take the answer now, if I may, please.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:35:00+01:00	With all due respect, I made a general point-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:35:00+01:00	I asked one very specific question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:35:00+01:00	Yes, please.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:35:00+01:00	My next question relates to the Federation of Early Childhood Providers. Will the Minister intervene directly to ensure that the federation, which I understand represents 1,400 providers, will be included in the advisory group?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:35:00+01:00	The Minister referred to the Norwegian model in connection with the next phase of opening up. There is no reference in her speech to floor space. This will be crucial to the operation of any model because it will have an impact on the number of children who can be catered for at any given time. Regarding full-time provision for children between zero and six years, I understand the floor space is anywhere from 3.5 sq. m per child to 2.3 sq m. per child. Under the Danish model, on which I have information, the area is anywhere from 4 sq. m to 6 sq. m. The regulations associated with the Norwegian model state: "The indicative norm for indoor play area is 4m² per child over 3 years old and approximately 0.33m² for a child under three." I want to tease out with the Minister the issue that has been raised by other speakers in respect of the capacity of providers to provide highly regulated early years childcare in the new paradigm we are facing in a way that ensures every child gets a chance and that none is left behind, and that there is no lottery system for children and their parents in regard to provision. If necessary, will an increase in capacity be sought beyond the providers, or will the providers be allowed to rent or be subsidised for seeking extra space? What is the internal advice to the Minister from her officials on the permutations for the provision of space and the regulations at present?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:40:00+01:00	My final intervention relates to insurance. I seek a clarification from the Minister on the statement I understand she made to the effect that Allianz is providing 95% of the insurance cover in this area at present and that Covid-19, or the risk of it, does not arise. I may have misinterpreted what she said. I just want further clarity as to who exactly she or her officials are talking. Is it an umbrella body or is she talking to specific insurance providers. If it is the latter, to which providers is she talking?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-05-20T15:40:00+01:00	What is the nature of that conversation? Is Allianz setting preconditions or laying down any benchmarks which the Department must reach before it can be satisfied that it can provide cover to the providers in any new scheme?
