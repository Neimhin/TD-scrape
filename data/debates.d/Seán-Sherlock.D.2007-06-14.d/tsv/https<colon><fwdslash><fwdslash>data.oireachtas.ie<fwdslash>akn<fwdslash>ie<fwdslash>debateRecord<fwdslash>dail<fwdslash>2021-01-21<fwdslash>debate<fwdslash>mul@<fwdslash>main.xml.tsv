SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	I say in the best spirit possible that it is not the first time that has happened to Pairtí an Lucht Oibre.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In the short time that is open to me, I share with Deputy Mac Lochlainn an interest in the question around Rockall. It would be good to have some clarity on that. That is my first question. As I only have four and a half minutes left, a one-minute answer would suffice.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	I welcome the reply. I look forward to hearing about progress on that matter. The Minister has mentioned the idea of a temporary fleet tie-up scheme in the context of the €1 billion Brexit adjustment fund. Is he giving consideration to a decommissioning scheme, and if so, will he include the smaller vessels that would have been excluded which were under the 18 m threshold in such a scheme? We want to ensure, if such a scheme is being considered from that €1 billion, that smaller boats would be included in that as well.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-01-21T15:30:00+00:00	It would appear from the Minister's reply that he has not given consideration to the idea of a decommissioning scheme. I would ask, frankly, because it is important for us to be honest with people in fishing communities as well. There will be those who will avail of a decommissioning scheme if it is appropriately funded. It is something that should be put on the table. It is important for us to be honest with fishing communities as well. The fact of the matter is that the consequence of this deal and the loss of quota will have an impact, especially on smaller inshore vessels. Let us be honest with fishermen about that. I would ask that the Minister give me a clear answer in respect of whether he will consider the idea of a decommissioning scheme, specifically in favour of smaller vessels throughout our coastal communities, in the context of this €1 billion fund.
