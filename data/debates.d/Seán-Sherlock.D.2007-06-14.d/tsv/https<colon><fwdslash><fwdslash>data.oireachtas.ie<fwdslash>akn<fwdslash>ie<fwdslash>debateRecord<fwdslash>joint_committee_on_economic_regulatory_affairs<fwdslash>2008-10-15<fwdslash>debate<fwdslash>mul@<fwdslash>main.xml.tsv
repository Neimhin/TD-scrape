SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I welcome the delegation.  The purpose of the visit and the establishment of an ombudsman is a reasonable request.  We support this and I do not know if it is within the remit of this committee to create such a post but it is certainly within our remit to lobby for such a post.  I will be bringing the suggestion to the Labour Party spokesperson on enterprise and employment.  It should be on the political agenda.I represent a constituency that has a mix of urban and rural areas.  There are many businesses like those represented by the CSNA in rural settings and they find it difficult to survive.  Not only are they faced with the cost and bureaucratic nature of doing business but local authority charges are increasing year on year.  If there is a move towards expansion, the development levies and contributions that small businesses must pay to the county council are regressive.  Business is being used as a means to fund local government, something that must be reviewed.  If we continue to punish small businesses that operate in a rural environment, it will have a knock-on effect on the presence of those businesses in the future.  Something must be done and the establishment of an ombudsman would be beneficial to take an overview of the regulatory framework and the punitive costs placed on businesses in those settings.I was interested in the comments on the National Consumer Agency and Repak.  I have not figured out what Repak does.  I see the wonderful advertisements it puts out and the impression is created that the recycling regime in this country is wonderful.  However, it raises questions about the nature of the recycling regime.Through their membership of Repak, the larger multiples are let off the hook with regard to the packaging directive because there is no requirement to recycle at the point of purchase.  I would like to hear more about this.  If there is a position paper outlining the delegates' views on that relationship perhaps that might be sent to me.  We must look at that issue.I did not realise that such a high percentage of turnover related to communications, if I might broadly describe it that way.  Perhaps this committee might bring in the National Consumer Agency and put more stringent questions to it.  In essence, I disagree with nothing that has been said by the witnesses.  It is common sense and highlights the situation of independent retailers who are sustaining businesses in difficult times against competition from larger multiples.  There must be a regulatory framework in order to make it a bit easier for the representatives and their members.  Rather than hinder them, it should facilitate doing business because of the people and the communities they serve.  This is a basic commonsensical argument and it should be supported.
