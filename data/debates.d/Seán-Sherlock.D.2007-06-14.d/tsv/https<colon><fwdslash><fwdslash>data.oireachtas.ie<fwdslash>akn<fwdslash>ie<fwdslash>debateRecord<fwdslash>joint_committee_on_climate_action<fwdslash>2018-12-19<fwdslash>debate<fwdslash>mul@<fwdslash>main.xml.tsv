SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T12:50:00+00:00	I want to talk about community-owned energy projects and community initiatives. Why is it taking so long for community energy projects and community energy initiatives to get connections to the grid? I am hearing stories of projects which have been waiting for seven to ten years. Why has this not been sorted out?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T12:50:00+00:00	If a community energy project comes into being within the next six months, how long will it reasonably take to get it onto the grid, in light of what has just been said?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	Mr. Melvin could provide a real-time analysis of what is happening but it is arguable that what he describes is theoretical. Is the RESS live now and what is the expectation for a community energy project in rural Cork, for example, if it started tomorrow?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	There are different pieces to the jigsaw.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	Assuming they do under the RESS, the commission will regulate them.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	Okay. There is much talk of the front end of what consumers will see and the choices they might have relating to energy supply into their homes. That is fine and wonderful. I have had some briefing from the ESB about smart metering. I want to get to the back end. If we are going to encourage a move towards renewables, we need to hear from the CRU about how it will unlock the regulatory burdens for community energy projects to get on the smart grid, as it has been called, and incentivise people to start producing electricity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	If everything fits into place, could the timeline be reduced from seven to ten years, to a shorter but still reasonable expectation? What is that reasonable expectation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	Could I have a range?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T13:00:00+00:00	The logic of my intervention is based on the Scottish model. There are 500 MW now being generated and it is approximately 5% of renewable capacity in Scotland. It has hit that specific target. If we can translate a Scottish model into an Irish context, we would be doing a good day's work.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T14:50:00+00:00	I thank Lord Deben and Mr. Stark for taking the time to attend today. We are grateful for their insights thus far. My question is simple. I will have an interactive session with the deputation, if I may, in the time I have. I want to get a sense from Lord Deben about Brexit and to what extent Brexit is informing his thinking as chairperson in terms of the challenges faced throughout the United Kingdom in the foreseeable future.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T14:50:00+00:00	That dovetails nicely with my next question, which relates to carbon budgeting. This is a feature of the landscape in the United Kingdom. We do not have that system here but we are talking about that system at the moment. It is developing as a concept. There are some signals coming from Government that it might be a way for Government to proceed. I am keen to get a sense or understanding of the dynamic that exists between the UK Prime Minister's office relating to setting targets and how individual UK line Departments measure up to those individual targets. If a Department does not reach a given target or hit a milestone, is there a punitive effect thereafter for individual Departments? It would be useful for those of us on this committee to have a sense or understanding of the dynamics that exist between the UK Prime Minister's office and the actual principle of carbon budgeting in the first instance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T14:50:00+00:00	That leads me to one of the recommendations of our Citizens' Assembly. It spoke about creating an independent body above Government with legislative teeth that could put manners, as it were, on individual Departments. The idea was that it would take the matter out of the silo-based system that we all understand so well. Is there merit in that argument?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-19T16:10:00+00:00	I apologise because I must leave now but I wish to express my gratitude to Lord Deben and Mr. Stark for their attendance.
