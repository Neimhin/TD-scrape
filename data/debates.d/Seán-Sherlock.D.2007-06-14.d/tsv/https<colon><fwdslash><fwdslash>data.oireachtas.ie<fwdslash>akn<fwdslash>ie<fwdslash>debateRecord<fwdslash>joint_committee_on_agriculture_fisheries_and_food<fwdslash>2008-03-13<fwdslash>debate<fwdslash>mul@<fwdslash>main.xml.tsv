SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the IFA delegation.  The debate last week could have been delayed a little further pending a good discussion or exchange of views on this issue, although that is as may be.  Our view is one which unashamedly seeks to protect the national interest.  In seeking to do so, we are protecting our economy, particularly the rural economy, and a way of life that is under threat as matters stand.Commissioner Mandelson has an agenda which is incongruous when compared to the founding principles of the European Union on issues of subsidiarity and its position as a Community-based trading bloc.  While we all recognise the WTO is here to stay, I remain sceptical about the prospect of a deal any time soon.  I also remain sceptical about the possibility of any of these issues moving on in the current political climate.  While the outcome of the US presidential election will probably have a major bearing on matters, it will not be decided before November.Be that as it may, this is an important issue for Ireland.  I welcome exchanges of views such as this and feel this should happen more often in this committee.  While one could potentially question the relevance of these debates with regard to their impact on the final negotiations, it is a matter for debate.  It is important for the Irish Parliament to have its say and to reflect these views, and it is important that the Minister would come to the House to report on her negotiations to date.Unlike Mr. Walshe, I think the Minister's negotiating position is quite good, as was her speech last week — I am speaking above the party-political ambit in this regard.  I understand that she has to couch her language in a certain way.  She should not come out at this stage and say that no deal is better than a bad deal.  There is still some time to play with on this issue and she should build on the progress she has made in establishing the alliance with 19 other member states, which could represent a bloc that will hopefully bring Commissioner Mandelson to book on this issue.  She could also perhaps hitch her wagon to the French caravan in seeking to rein in that gentleman.There is no doubt that Commissioner Mandelson's agenda is totally at variance with that of the Council of Ministers or the member states.  Although he is the EU's representative at the WTO, I wonder to what extent the Commission, a supra-national organisation, has powers that would supersede those of the member states.  It is an issue that needs to be clarified because we could trade away the rural economy at a time when other sectors of the economy are in serious danger of being undermined.  The agribusiness sector is the one sector that has remained a constant through thick and thin throughout the history of the State.  It is the one that will always be there.  If we are to trade away those concessions that have been hard won through tough negotiations since the foundation of the EU, we must call into question the fundamental make-up of the Union as it is currently constituted.  We cannot trade away these issues lightly for the sake of one man's agenda.Having read the Minister's speech and knowing her position, I believe she is acting in the national interest.  We are still in the middle of a negotiation and there is uncertainty as to where it will end.  As the Doha process began in 2001 and it is now 2008, it is fair to ask where we are going.  I do not foresee any deal being concluded.  I would welcome further and regular exchanges of views on this issue between the Minister, the farming organisations and the members of this committee, perhaps meeting in one room, so that I, as a member of the Labour Party, can reflect these views in full view of the Minister and the farming organisations.  This would be an important and good way to proceed in the future.
