[<p eid="para_40">I welcome the Minister and his officials to the committee.  I refer to the animal health and welfare Bill.  For the record, a charade is being played out here in respect of the animal health and welfare Bill.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions.  I acknowledge that I have been offered briefings on the matter and it remains for me to organise those.  That is a matter for me.  However, it was included in the legislative programme and we seek to have it published with haste.</p>, <p eid="para_41">Will the Bill deal with non-farm animals and will an undertaking be given in respect of the treatment of horses?  An issue is surfacing throughout the country at present whereby horses are being abandoned.  It is particularly prevalent in the area of north Cork and I wish to see provisions in the Bill which would deal with that issue.  I call on the Minister to respond in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_42">I refer to section 17A and I agree with the provision.  I believe a robust provision is necessary to deal with the health and welfare and the control of diseases of animals.  If robust provisions are missing then one compromises the comparative advantage we have economically in respect of the production of food.  Arguably, there is an authoritarian streak to the provision, but it is one with which I have no particular problem.  If we do not have information about the number of incidents that occurred under the section 17A provision then the committee is left in the dark in respect of how we make an informed decision about whether to continue with it.  While the Minister's party is in the majority and will decide the issue at the end of the day and I have no particular problem with section 17A, I remain concerned that a lack of knowledge exists in respect of it and I call on the Minister to talk us through the provision.</p>, <p eid="para_43">The Minister stated "where the exercise of the powers in section 17A are activated, an authorised officer must have a reasonable suspicion before acting.  In the case of entry to a private dwelling, a search warrant is required".  I call on the Minister to talk us through that process and to give some indication to the committee of how this has been enforced in the past 12 months.</p>, <p eid="para_44">It is high time the animal health and welfare Bill was introduced.  I realise a significant number of issues attach to the Bill and its publication.  I trust that when the provisions of the Bill dealing with non-farm animals are published they will include some provision in respect of or do something about the number of horses being slaughtered and left to die in public areas throughout the country, and that strenuous and strong provisions would be included in the Bill in this regard.  I call on the Minister will speak to that issue in his reply.</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">I agree with the Minister's point about the responsibility of the owners of horses, of that there is no question.  I also agree that the Minister and his Department have done their best on funding of local authorities.  He has acknowledged the role played by animal welfare groups.  I am in total agreement with the Minister on that point.</p>, <p eid="para_112">There is an issue regarding people who have not registered horses and who operate outside of registered premises.  Acts of cruelty are being visited upon animals who have, for want of a better term, no fixed abode.</p>]
[<p eid="para_114">I seek the inclusion of some provision in the legislation that will put an onus on the owner, or will ensure that every horse has some identifiable marking, to ensure that the ISPCA and the local authorities will not be hampered in their work in dealing with incidents of acts of cruelty to animals.  When they have to investigate incidents, they will be able to trace the animal back to the owner.  That is my view on this issue.</p>]
