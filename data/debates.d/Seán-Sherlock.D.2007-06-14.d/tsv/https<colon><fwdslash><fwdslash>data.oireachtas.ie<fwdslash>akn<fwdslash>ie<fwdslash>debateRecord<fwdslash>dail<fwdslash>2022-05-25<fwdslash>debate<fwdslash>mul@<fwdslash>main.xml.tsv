As she said, the committee already adjudicated on this very issue in a previous iteration of this Bill. I see no reason that there should not be continuity in that regard for the same reasons the Deputy outlined. The role of the GAL should not be overly prescribed. Should a particular set of circumstances arise, there should be a degree of latitude and understanding. Given a particular type of scenario that might arise in respect of the child, we should ensure the childâ€™s interests are served in the widest possible means that is allowable. The amendment speaks to that need specifically and I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward.
