SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  Most of my questions have already been covered by Deputy Sheahan so there is no point in my repeating them.  However, I am interested in the statement made by Commissioner Borg to the fisheries committee of the European Parliament on 10 February that the Hague preferences would be open for negotiation.  In terms of fisheries policy, it seems the Irish voice at the European Council was weak to begin with and we have been on the back foot ever since.  I would like to get a sense from the Minister of State of whether, with the review which is to take place in 2012, there will be a strengthening of Irish fisheries and their economic potential, or whether it will be the usual negotiation for the lowest common denominator.  Is there potential for growth in real terms?I would also like to hear the Minister of State speak more about the potential for aquaculture.  Having read the reports about the seminar that took place in Kenmare on 19 March, I can see there is massive potential for jobs growth in this sector.  I would like to hear how that would be brought about in real terms.  In terms of marketing initiatives, I can see how the European Seafood Exposition could yield results, but such initiatives have been ongoing for years.  BIM has been strong in terms of marketing Irish fishing, but there seems to be a status quo.  Are there new initiatives which will seek to corner a greater percentage of the export market from the point of view of aquaculture and sea-fisheries?With regard to the percentage shares held by each member state, the Minister stated they had generally remained the same for more than 20 years under the principle of relative stability.  I do not know exactly what this principle means, although I have an idea of what it might mean, but perhaps the Minister of State could discuss that further.The Minister of State did not refer to the future of eel fishing in his statement.  I would like him to elaborate on this.  Is there a future for eel fishing in this country?  Is it coming under threat at present?  What is the Minister of State's view?
