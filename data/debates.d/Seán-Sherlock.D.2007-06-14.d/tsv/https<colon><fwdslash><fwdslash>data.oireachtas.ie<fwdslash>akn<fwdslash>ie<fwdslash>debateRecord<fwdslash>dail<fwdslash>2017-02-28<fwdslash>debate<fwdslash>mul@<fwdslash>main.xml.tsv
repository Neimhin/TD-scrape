[<p eid="para_145">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his latitude. The question that arises is whether a pathway can be provided within existing legislation. We need an answer to the question of whether or not it is the case that a medical practitioner can apply for a licence to administer the specific medication that is deemed to be required in this case. It would be very helpful to the family in question - the Twomey family - if the Taoiseach could clarify the position.</p>]
