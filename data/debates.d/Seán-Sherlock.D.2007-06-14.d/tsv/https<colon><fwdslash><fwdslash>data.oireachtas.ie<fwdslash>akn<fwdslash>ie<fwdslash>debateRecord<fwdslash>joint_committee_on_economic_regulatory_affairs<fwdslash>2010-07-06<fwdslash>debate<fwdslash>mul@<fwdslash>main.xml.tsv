[<p eid="para_26">I welcome the delegation.  How many credit unions are on the books of the ICB?</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">In terms of loan data held, Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh refers to historical indicators and a rotating window of 24 months.  What does he mean by that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_30">In effect, the Irish Credit Bureau is the vessel which institutions which are members will go through in terms of loan histories and so on.  If I understand Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh correctly, there could a person who, for example, hits a snag in the last two to three years, which is what is invariably happening, despite having had a perfect credit history for the previous ten or 15 years, and this is taken into account and the ICB's systems are designed in such a way as to allow for this eventuality.  In other words, a person may have a very good credit history but then hits difficulties and the system would take that up on an overall basis when assessing the person.</p>]
[<p eid="para_32">What one wants to see, if it is put on a statutory footing, is that the system and its underpinning assumptions do not militate against somebody who is ordinarily very compliant in terms of his or her repayments but who may hit the wall at some stage during his or her repayment schedules.  My main fear concerns those I have referred to MABS or who would have had dealings with credit unions. What I have found is that credit unions have acted as a type of lender — I will not call it a lender of last resort, but they have cushioned people who have dodgy credit histories against moneylenders, who are largely unregulated.  I have seen situations in which credit unions have kept the wolf from the door for certain people with bad credit histories.  What I am anxious to find out is whether the Irish Credit Bureau's system will take that into account or see it as a mitigating factor.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">I accept the point.</p>, <p eid="para_36">How many moneylending organisations, which charge rates of up to 100%, are on the books of the Irish Credit Bureau?</p>]
[<p eid="para_38">What would be the implications of putting all this on a statutory footing?  It would obviously increase the bureau's operations significantly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_40">What is Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's view on that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_42">The bureau is not a statutory body, so Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh can speak freely.</p>]
