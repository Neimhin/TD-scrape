[<p eid="para_130">I welcome the contributors here this morning. I want to start with the 18 May deadline. That was the deadline that was fixed in the minds of all of us here in terms of the expectation that childcare for healthcare workers would be provided at that point. I am talking about the roadmap. That deadline was missed. What I find extraordinary, and this what I would like to get a view on from both SIPTU and the INMO, is the litany of correspondence between the INMO, in particular, and the various line Departments. I have the dates here in the INMO's submission: 6 April; 16 April; freedom of information requests in respect of 8 April and 9 April; again two more on 9 April; on 27 April; and even on 6 May. There seems to me to have been a very proactive and progressive attempt by the INMO to engage with the HSE and through the ambit of NPHET and the line Departments in respect of putting in place something to meet the deadline of 18 May.</p>, <p eid="para_131"> If I look at the evidence base here, based on the litany of correspondence, I would have to conclude objectively that there was never going to be a serious attempt on the part of the HSE, NPHET or even any of the line Departments to provide any kind of childcare for healthcare workers. I would like to get the reaction of the witnesses to that. It seems to me that there was no concerted effort. There was maybe a bit of pageantry being gone through, a bit of choreography, or a pretence that they were going to deal with that issue. I would like to get the perspective of the witnesses on whether they felt they were taken seriously as healthcare workers in respect of whether the Government was actually going to come up with a scheme that was fit for purpose and to which everybody would subscribe.</p>, <p eid="para_132"> Looking at the scheme up to 18 May, it was going to be devised along the lines of childcare professionals going into the homes of healthcare workers. In my opinion, for what it is worth, and I would love to hear the witnesses' opinion, they had never fully worked through what the protocols around that would be. It seems to me that what we are at here is the Government is going through a charade in respect of taking the issue seriously. That is the first point. I would love to get the reaction of the witnesses to that in the short time that I have.</p>]
[<p eid="para_136">I appreciate that. The message to take away for us, as public representatives and Teachtaí Dála, is that the issue of the clawback of parental leave needs to be addressed. There has to be recognition of healthcare workers in respect of the amount of parental leave and other leave that they have taken to meet their childcare needs. The State owes them a service or favour in that respect in terms of seeking to claw that back.</p>, <p eid="para_137">Is Ms Ní Sheaghdha confident that all of her colleagues will have access to childcare on 29 June?</p>]
[<p eid="para_366">I join others in thanking the witnesses for their contributions today and for the clarity of thought they bring to these proceedings. The messages they are imparting to us are well rehearsed, perhaps, in that they have spoken on these challenges previously. My first question relates to the temporary wage subsidy scheme. If it is the case that public funding accounts for approximately 58% of wages in the sector, is it now time to consider continuing with the temporary wage subsidy scheme for the providers who will reopen in September and to use that as a launch pad to build out the employment rights and proper wages akin to people's qualifications, so we can get the wages element of this resolved once and for all? There was an opportunity, which was articulated very well to me by Darragh O'Connor of SIPTU recently, whereby this could have been a launch pad for resolving the wages element of this. We see the high rates of attrition and the fact that some people will now cease to avail of the temporary wage subsidy scheme as it relates to the childcare sector. This has created a massive amount of uncertainty, which the witnesses have just articulated. Perhaps it is time for the State to fund paying wages in a way that is done in primary and post-primary schools.</p>]
[<p eid="para_368">I have only two minutes left.</p>]
[<p eid="para_370">I thank Ms Byrne and gaibh mo leithscéal for intervening. Is that shared by the other witnesses?</p>]
[<p eid="para_372">I apologise to Ms Daly but I have very little time. That is a "Yes".</p>]
[<p eid="para_374">I take it that is a "Yes" from all the contributors here. We need a launch pad for a proper wage commensurate with people's qualifications across the sector. Public funding accounts for 58% of childcare providers' income. This is what we will be told later on by officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We therefore, as a society, need to grasp that nettle.</p>, <p eid="para_375"> I will move to my second and final question. There are many disparate groups representing childcare interests. I have to be honest; they are all excellent people but there are many different voices and I believe that now is the time for the sector to unite as one voice because it is sometimes difficult for us, as politicians, to distinguish which group represents what interest. I put it to the witnesses, as advocates on behalf of children and parents and as providers, that now is the time for some sort of citizens' assembly to look at the future of childcare provision and the early years sector in Ireland. Perhaps it is time to consider having one coherent voice in that regard because, quite frankly, if I was not spokesperson for children, I would be largely ignorant of the childcare model. I am telling the truth in that. I am a father of two young smallies as well, so I have a particular interest in this area, but sometimes speaking with one voice is more coherent and can strengthen one's message in interacting with Government.</p>]
[<p eid="para_603">I will gladly take the balance of the Green Party member's time, if I could.</p>]
[<p eid="para_605">Deputy Costello is very kind. I thank the witnesses for appearing before us. I want to go back to the staff ratios. There are two stories here; there is the 29 June scenario and the September onwards scenario. What is the Department's assessment of the level of demand in percentage terms for 29 June onwards with regard to staff? Will 50% or 40% be back? I ask the witnesses to give us a picture on that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_607">Staff and parental. I want to get a clearer picture of what the sector will look like.</p>]
[<p eid="para_609">If that is 50%, and if we are looking at the new pod type arrangements, because we had a considerable discussion on this in the Dáil some time back, the question arises as to how staffing will be applied to the new pod arrangements in September. I presume it will go back up to 100%. Can the new pod system be made work, particularly for smaller and older providers that have been providing services in the community for a decade or two or even longer, if a serious constraint is put on them if the pod system is to be adhered to, notwithstanding the fact that reopening grants and once-off capital grants are being made available? I note what was said about providers feeding back that they would be able to manage it, but even if €18 million is put in place for additional staffing costs, training and staff guidelines, additional resources, hygiene and cleaning consumables, if the regulatory regime on the spatial requirements is applied uniformly throughout the system it will have a major impact on providers throughout the State, such that there will be an even higher rate of attrition in the number of providers. What I am getting at is if we could get some assurance from the Department and Tusla that the hammer will not fall too hard and common sense will be applied, such that people will be allowed to survive as long as they meet, by and large, the requirements expected of them.</p>]
[<p eid="para_612">I appreciate that. We had a good engagement with the INMO and SIPTU earlier regarding healthcare workers. The evidence is there about the level of engagement with the INMO, in particular, in respect of 18 May, which was the date on which childcare was supposed to be provided for front-line workers. I contend that there was a failure on the part of the State to live up to its promise to deliver for those workers. It is incumbent on us to acknowledge that there was a failure in respect of those people. Do the witnesses acknowledge that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and all Departments failed those front-line workers? There is a major issue whereby it considerably added to the stress and strain placed on those workers in trying to do their jobs. These people had a legitimate expectation, which was preannounced in the context of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, that they would have access to those childcare facilities but this never happened. Should we not now acknowledge that there was a failure on the part of the State towards those people? Do they not deserve an apology for that or some acknowledgement of the failure to which I refer?</p>]
[<p eid="para_614">I apologise for cutting across Dr. Lynch. Why was that not signalled at an earlier stage to the organisations that represent those workers? It would have been much easier for people to digest if there were legitimate issues such as those relating to insurance.</p>]
