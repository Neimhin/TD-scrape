SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I welcome the Mr. Kavanagh and his colleagues to the committee.  The Labour Party issued a document through Deputy Upton called Raising the Stakes which raises similar aspirations and concerns to those set out by the delegates.  Why do we have a situation in which celebrities plug online betting exchanges when the evidence is clear they are not contributing to the Exchequer or the prize money for the very races on which people place their bets?The challenge for the next Government will be to go after the online community.  It is disingenuous of the big betting companies, which have an online presence alongside offshore accounting procedures, to expect the Irish taxpayer will continue to fund prizes and allow them to live off the fat of the land.   I come from Mallow, where Mrs. Bambury has operated a bookmaking operation through thick and thin.  I wonder how this matter affects her given that she does not have an online presence.  She is funding the prize money through the levy while the big operators are not required to pay.  We need to address that disparity.The delegates' submission reveals a willingness to engage.  If politicians can work with Horse Racing Ireland, we would be able to reach an arrangement that allows for the continued funding of the industry.  It has to be funded by punters and companies as well as taxpayers.  The companies will have to stop hiding under wonderful statements about the jobs they are creating.  I acknowledge they are creating jobs but they cannot use that as a battering ram to get away from funding prize money.  We need to find solutions and in that regard I welcome the submission as a step forward.
