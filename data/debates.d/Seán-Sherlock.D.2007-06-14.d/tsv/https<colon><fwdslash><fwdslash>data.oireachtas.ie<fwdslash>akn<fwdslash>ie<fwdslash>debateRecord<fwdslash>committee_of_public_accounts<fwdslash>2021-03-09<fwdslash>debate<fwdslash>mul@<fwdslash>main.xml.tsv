SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:40:00+00:00	I thank the Chairman. I thank Mr. Black and his colleagues for attending before the committee today. I want to start with the situation of Ulster Bank, which is a key lender in the SME food sector. In my analysis, it has been seen as the key bank to go to for small to medium-sized food companies seeking to access lending for productive purposes. I want to get a sense from Mr. Black as to, first, whether there is now a high level of exposure for that sector, given the decision of Ulster Bank to pull out of the market, and, second, whether SBCI is aware of this and if it is something that is on its agenda. If we take the two challenges of Covid and Brexit, as well as the importance of the food sector and the recognition of Ulster Bank as being a go-to bank for small to medium-sized food companies that are export driven, is there a consciousness within SBCI of the need to plug that gap in lending? Is this a conversation that is taking place at present? I would like to get that perspective from Mr. Black, if I may.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	Is my perception right and is my research solid in saying that there is a strong relationship between food companies and Ulster Bank in particular? I accept that there are strong relationships with other banks. Ulster Bank is, however, the go-to bank for certain entities in the food sector. I refer, for example, to small, mainly family-run start-ups or, perhaps, high potential start-up companies that are scaling up and exporting. I am seeking comfort from the SBCI on what Mr. Black said about the MOU. Is that Mr. Black's view, insofar as he can speak for Ulster Bank and insofar as we are still going through a process here? I do not want to see a chunk of lending potential slipping off the radar and a chunk of a sector that is vital to Ireland's economic interests finding itself in a position where it has no go-to bank for the type of funding the SBCI provides to the on-lenders. Can Mr. Black give me some level of comfort in that regard? A signal from the SBCI in respect of that matter would give some assurances to people who live, breathe and work in this sector every day.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	I understand that the agriculture fund set up by the SBCI was oversubscribed. Is it the view of the SBCI that there is potential for a new funding facility in that sector? Again, this is a vital sector. It is export-driven and faces the headwinds of Covid-19. Obviously, Brexit still hangs above many companies and producers like the sword of Damocles. Is it the intention of the SBCI to look at potential funding in the agriculture sector? It is lending for productive purposes. The fund in question was oversubscribed in the previous round. Mr. Black might also give us his perspective on that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	Can Mr. Black talk me through the strategic review for the period 2020 to 2025? He referred to new SME funding for the energy retrofit sector. How advanced is that conversation at present? When does Mr. Black see the SBCI moving into that sector for productive lending? How does he propose that those moneys will be disbursed? Reference was made to the credit unions. To what extent does Mr. Black see credit unions as a viable option for funding into this sector? It very much filters down to the local economy. Where stands the conversation in that regard?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	Mr. Black mentioned the Department. Obviously, the SBCI is in discussions with the parent Department. Detail is important for people like us in the committee. Is that money proposed to be divested through the SBCI's on-lending partners? What are the entities through which Mr. Black is talking about divesting moneys?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	I will move very briefly on to the issue of pay. Are pay rates for employees set by the NTMA?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T09:50:00+00:00	They are performance-related pay rates.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T10:00:00+00:00	Why were performance-related payments made in 2019, for instance, when SBCI had a loss that year of â‚¬408,000?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T10:00:00+00:00	If I may please Mr. Black, as I have limited time, I am not being facetious in any way but I want to understand the dynamic or the metrics Mr. Black uses when determining pay rates. Respectfully, I fail to see the link between quantitative easing and the setting of pay scales.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T10:00:00+00:00	There was some mention in the review relating to the abatement and pulling back of SBCI. I would read that language as withdrawing. Is the bank's existence justified at the present time?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-03-09T11:10:00+00:00	I appreciate the Chair for letting me back in. I have an example of an SME that is operating in the tourism, leisure and outdoor sector. The owner made approaches to Close Brothers and KBCI in respect of SBCI funding. When he contacted KBCI, he was informed that it was using the SBCI future growth loan scheme fund, but it was, and I quote from the email, "only offering loans to businesses registered with a professional body". I ask the SBCI to carry out an examination of that interaction internally. I can give the witnesses the name of the company following the meeting. None of us wants to see unnecessary impediments being put in the way of SMEs if they happen to be seeking funding in a sector of the economy that might not pass muster with "banking types". I might be a little unkind in my use of language. The application is somewhat left field, but nonetheless, it is worth further examination. The owner seems to have to jump through hoops with the SBCI in order to pass muster. The main point that I am making is that certain sectors of the economy should not be discounted on the basis that they are not deemed to be fashionable or de rigueur.
