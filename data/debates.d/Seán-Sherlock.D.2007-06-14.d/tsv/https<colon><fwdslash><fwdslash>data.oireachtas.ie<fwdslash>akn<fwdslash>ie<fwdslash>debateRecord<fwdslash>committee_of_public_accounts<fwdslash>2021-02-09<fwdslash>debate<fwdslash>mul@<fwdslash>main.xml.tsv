SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	I have a question for Mr. Gunning. He mentioned the issue of compliance by the contractor with the programme. Presumably this is a programme of work, an agreed workflow chart, to use vernacular, non-technical language. Where stands the work programme at present? I ask Mr. Gunning to please answer in layman's terms, not in technical speak. What is the work programme's status?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	That is okay. I thank Mr. Gunning.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Gunning. Turning to Mr. Dempsey, the next question is for the Department of Health. Is there a representative of the Department on the board? That is the first simple question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	There is not. However, presumably the Department of Health, ergo the Minister, ergo the taxpayer, has some mechanism by which it can express an opinion on the level of claims. I refer both to the cost of those claims and the number of those claims. In other words, has there ever been an expression of worry by anybody in the Department of Health, at a sufficiently high level - right up to the Minister - in respect of the level of claims?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	An expression of worry or-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:45:00+00:00	-----or fear as to the cost of claims and the escalating cost of claims. I am trying to understand why we are at the position we are at now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-09T14:50:00+00:00	Without putting words in the witness's mouth, it is reasonable for me to assume from his response that there would have been an expression of worry for the process around claims. This leads me on to the next question. In his opening statement, Mr. Dempsey stated "The development board and the Department are nearing finalisation of this long and detailed analysis, which includes a determination of potential updates to the timeline and costs of the project." To what extent is the claims process mapped onto that "long and detailed analysis"? If I understand the previous witnesses correctly, it seems to me that if one was trying to map who is winning the battle of the claims war, the board is about a nose ahead at present but in the long-term analysis, it could be that the contractor might come out on top from a financial point of view. In other words, is there a deeper analysis of this taking place around the claims process?
