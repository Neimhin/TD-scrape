SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-03-25T18:20:00+00:00	I move: "That Report Stage be taken now."
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-03-25T18:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 1:In page 66, to delete lines 39 and 40.The purpose of this amendment is to delete the definition of "licensed bank". The definition is no longer necessary as the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has recommended use of "credit institution" rather than "licensed bank". This will result in uniformity of language throughout the Bill and is in line with EU law.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 2:In page 69, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:" "system of interconnection of registers” means the system of interconnection of central commercial and companies registers established in accordance with Article 4a(2) of Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009;".The purpose of the amendment is to define the system of interconnection of registers which is provided for by Directive 2012/17/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 2012 and must be transposed by 14 July 2014.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:20:00+00:00	I assure the Deputy the new directive ensures all EU member states enabling electronic communication between business registers and transmitting information to individual users will do so in a standardised way by means of identical content and interoperable technologies throughout the European Union. The system of interconnection of registers shall be composed of the registers of member states, a central platform, and one or more access portals. The European e-justice portal will serve as the European electronic access point and the new directive stipulates the European Commission may by means of implementing acts specify the technical specification, defining among others the structure of the standard message format for the purpose of the exchange of information between the registers, the platform and the portal, and the technical specifications defining the structure and the use of the unique identifier for communication between registers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:20:00+00:00	I hope I have covered them.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:30:00+00:00	At the outset, I do not propose to support these amendments. This series of amendments proposes to insert the words "managed and controlled" into sections of the Bill. When one considers it, the objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. One must think carefully about this and neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law because such an exercise, for the purposes of this Bill, comes within the remit and the function of the Minister for Finance. Moreover, the proposed amendments are illegal under both European Union and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the European Union law on freedom of establishment, which is a core aspect of European Union law. Compliance with this is monitored closely by the European Commission and Ireland recently has been required by the Commission to change a provision of Irish law, which requires that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision, as proposed, would go much further and effectively would require all management activities to occur within the State. This clearly would be a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and would trammel significantly the ability of a company from another European Union member state to establish itself in Ireland. Furthermore, the proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is completely unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Consequently, for these reasons I will not be accepting these amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:30:00+00:00	As one Government Minister among many, we have spent considerable time over the past three years in travelling abroad and encouraging investment. I recently have returned from the mid-west of the United States, where Ireland's reputation regarding the potential for foreign direct investment is very strong. A clear message is coming from the United States of America, to name one country as an example, that there is a clear intent on the part of companies to explore the options of investing in a country like Ireland. Specific meetings have been held with specific target companies through IDA Ireland, companies have been brought out through Enterprise Ireland and no one I have met has mentioned anything about our reputation. The opposite is the case and while I would be interested to see the set of metrics to which the Deputy has access - if there are reputational issues - when it comes to a decision by a company to invest in Ireland, based on the companies that have been attracted here even over the past 24 months, it is clear there is significant interest in Ireland in respect of inward investment and creating jobs.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:30:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 5:In page 77, line 35, to delete “licensed bank” and substitute “credit institution”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:30:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 7:In page 83, to delete lines 23 and 24 and substitute the following:“(3) In subsection (2), “person” means, for the purposes of paragraph (b) of it, the company referred to in that paragraph.”.The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to correct the incorrect cross-reference in subsection (3) from paragraph (b) to (a). The purpose of amendment No. 9 is clarification. Deletion of the word "it" and its replacement with "the company" makes it clearer that the company shall notify the registrar of the authorisation of a person as being entitled to bind the company in the prescribed form. The function of amendment No. 218 is to clarify to whom the notification requirement applies. Section 1081 restates section 229(1) of the 1990 Act. The obligation to notify the Stock Exchange under section 229(1) only applies where shares have been purchased either by the company that issued the shares or by a company that is that company's subsidiary.Section 1081, as it stands, extends this obligation beyond existing law to where shares are purchased by a body corporate, which includes companies incorporated abroad. This amendment is in line with the existing law and purports to maintain it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 8:In page 88, line 35, after "Where" to insert "the board of directors of".The purpose of these amendments is for clarification. The Bill, as it stands, has been interpreted as meaning the board of directors must be registered with the Companies Registration Office. That is not the intention of this section, which is drawn from existing law, Regulation 6(3) of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973, SI 163 of 1973. It provides that where a company chooses to appoint a person to fully bind the company on its behalf, such a company must notify the registrar in the CRO, who will register the person as the company's registered person. Where a company revokes such an authorisation, the person will be considered as a registered person until the registrar is notified in the prescribed form of this revocation. The purpose of such a provision is to reduce red tape for companies that wish to authorise a registered person to have full authority to exercise any power of the company. This will save banks and other third parties from having to search through the minutes of the company's board meetings to check whether a person is authorised to bind the company. This authority is limited by any power of management of the company exercisable by its board of directors or where this Bill requires a power to be exercised otherwise.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 9:In page 89, line 1, to delete "it" and substitute "the company".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 10:In page 89, line 6, after "by" to insert "the board of the directors of".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 11:In page 89, line 8, after "Where" to insert "the board of directors of".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 12:In page 89, line 24, after "by" to insert "the board of the directors of".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 13:In page 92, lines 13 and 14, to delete "if a company has appointed a registered person" and substitute "if there be a registered person in relation to a company,".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 14:In page 92, lines 16 to 18, to delete all words from and including "countersigned" in line 16 down to and including "purpose." in line 18 and substitute the following:"countersigned—(a) by the secretary or a director of the company; or(b) by some other person appointed for the purpose by its directors or a committee of its directors authorised by its directors in that behalf.".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 15:In page 93, to delete lines 1 to 15.I have been asked by the Bills Office to inform the House that there is a problem with a footnote to an amendment in this grouping. Amendment No. 244 ought to be accompanied by a footnote to state that section 1019, to which it refers, is being inserted by amendment No. 206.  The purpose of these amendments is to correct an unintended change caused by the Bill's structure and to revert to existing law in accordance with the policy intention. Section 45, which is the official seal for sealing securities, restates section 3 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1977 and provides that a company may have an official seal which is a facsimile of the common seal for the purposes of sealing securities issued by the company and sealing documents creating or evidencing securities so issued. Section 3 of the Act of 1977 does not apply to private limited companies. The policy is to restrict the scope of section 45 to public companies and to re-enact the existing law. Thus, this section should be deleted for private companies limited by shares. New sections are proposed to be inserted in the relevant parts to provide for PLCs, PUCs and PULCs. Such public companies shall have an official seal which is a facsimile of the common seal and which has on its face the word "securities" or the Irish language equivalent.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 16:In page 98, line 11, after "subsection (3)" to insert ", and without prejudice to subsection (7)".

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 18:In page 106, line 4, after "shares" to insert the following:"but, for the purposes of this definition, a company shall not be regarded as a subsidiary if it is such only by virtue of section 7(2)(a)(ii) or (e)".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:40:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 19:In page 107, line 6, after "this Act" to insert ", other than in section 70(11)(c),".

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:50:00+00:00	The Deputy is taking a novel approach, which I admire, but I am not in favour of adopting these amendments. The Deputy's proposals impose unduly oppressive conditions on legitimate businesses. The suggestion that a majority of directors should be EEA-resident may particularly dissuade foreign direct investment companies from doing business in this country, which would be bad for Ireland and for Irish commerce generally. Section 138, which re-enacts existing law, ensures that companies which do not have at least one director who is resident in an EEA state must put in place a bond, in the prescribed form, that becomes payable to a person nominated by the registrar or the Revenue Commissioners. The purpose of the bond is to discharge any fine imposed on the company in respect of an offence committed by it and prosecutable by the registrar or for the purpose of discharging certain fines and penalties imposed on it by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The moneys can also be used to cover expenses that are reasonably incurred in the collection of said penalties. The bond cannot be used for any other purpose. Therefore, the amendments proposed do not achieve any legitimate policy goal. Their sole effect is to create an arbitrary restriction on non-EEA companies trying to do business in Ireland. In that context, the Government will not support the amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T18:50:00+00:00	The Deputy has not said anything with which I would disagree, in principle. There is no question about the importance of the protection of employees. However, the corpus of law that would deal with that issue effectively is employment rather than company law. We have a very enhanced labour relations structure in this country. We also have an insolvency fund which is run by the Department of Social Protection. It is on that basis that we will not support the Deputy's amendments. We do not propose to incorporate the spirit of those amendments, as articulated by the Deputy, into company law because we feel that protections for employees already exist within employment law. Therefore, as I have already stated, we will not be accepting the amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 61:In page 170, line 19, to delete “In the case of” and substitute “Subject to subsection (1), in the case of”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 62:In page 175, to delete lines 8 and 9 and substitute the following:“(iii) in the case of a married person or civil partner, the name or surname by which he or she was known previously to his or her marriage or civil partnership.”.The purpose of the further amendment to this section is to make provision for a married person or civil partner and by making the section gender neutral by providing for his or her. This subsection is drawn from existing law and clarifies the use of the terms “surname” and “former forename”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 63:In page 176, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“(9) If a person appointed a director of a company before the commencement of this section has, subsequent to his or her appointment but before that commencement, become disqualified under the law of another state (whether pursuant to an order of a judge or a tribunal or otherwise) from being appointed or acting as director or secretary of a body corporate or an undertaking, then subsection (1) shall apply to such a case as it applies to a case of a director becoming so disqualified after that commencement.(10) For the purpose of the application of subsection (1) to the case first-mentioned in the preceding subsection, section 150 shall apply as if the following subsection were substituted for subsection (8):“(8) The company shall, within the period of 3 months after the commencement of this section, send to the Registrar a notification in the prescribed form of the change and of the date on which it occurred.”.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 64:In page 180, line 4, after “tax” to insert “or the universal social charge”.The purpose of these amendments is to insert a reference to the universal social charge, USC. As the Bill stands, there is a prohibition on the payment of remuneration to a director free of income tax. It is, however, silent regarding the USC. It is proposed this section be amended to include the USC, so that it shall not be lawful to pay a director a remuneration free of income tax and the USC.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 65:In page 180, line 14, after “tax” to insert “and the universal social charge”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 66:In page 180, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:“(3) Without prejudice to the generality of that subsection, subsection (1) operates to enable, subject to a limitation (if any) arising under any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of it, the directors of the company to exercise all powers of the company to borrow money and to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, or any part thereof.”.The purpose of this amendment is to reflect existing law by helpfully clarifying that directors are granted powers to borrow money and create charges.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 67:In page 182, to delete lines 31 to 34 and substitute the following:“162. (1) A resolution in writing signed by all the directors of a company, or by all the members of a committee of them, and who are for the time being entitled to receive notice of a meeting of the directors or, as the case may be, of such a committee, shall be as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of the directors or such a committee duly convened and held.”.The purpose of this amendment is to provide a helpful clarification regarding committees. The section contains supplemental provisions about meetings. The purpose of subsection 1 is to enable directors to decide on any particular matter without coming together for a formal meeting. As committees are also to be allowed use written resolutions, reference to them is included in the first part of the sentence.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 68:In page 189, line 29, to delete “subsections (1) and (2)” and substitute “subsections (1) and (3)”.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 70:In page 194, line 6, after “company” to insert “(being a bankrupt member who is entitled to vote at the meeting)”.The purpose of this amendment is for clarification. Again, notice of every general meeting shall be given to the assignee in bankruptcy of a bankrupt member of the company, that is to say, a bankrupt member who is entitled to vote at the meeting as opposed to a bankrupt member who is not entitled to vote.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 71:In page 195, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:“(4) Subsection (4) shall apply unless the company’s constitution provides otherwise.”.The purpose of this amendment is to determine the period which must elapse before a meeting must be adjourned for lack of a quorum. The time for the initial meeting has been shortened from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. The amendment to this section allows for the period to be modified by the company’s constitution.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 72:In page 213, line 21, after “liabilities” to insert the following:“(being the debts and liabilities identified for the purposes of paragraph (d) and so far as not already paid or discharged)”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 73:In page 219, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:“(5) Subsection (5) does not apply—(a) if the services to the other computer there mentioned are provided by means of the technology commonly known as cloud computing or by any other distance hosting solution; or(b) to the extent that regulations under subsection (6) provide that it shall not apply.”.The purpose of this amendment is to widen the section’s scope so as to provide for different methods of storing virtual information. As the Bill stands, the use of the term “server” is too restrictive and many companies now use cloud or hosted solutions to address IT technical requirements.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 74:In page 222, to delete lines 36 to 40, and in page 223, to delete lines 1 to 13 and substitute the following:“219. (1) Subsections (3) and (4) shall apply to any case in which a provision of this Act requires or authorises a notice to be served on or given to a member of a company by the company, or an officer of it, but save to the extent that the constitution of the company provides otherwise.(2) Subsection (5) shall only apply if there is contained in the company’s constitution a provision to the effect that it shall apply (but nothing in this subsection shall prevent alternative and reasonable provision being made in the constitution with regard to one or more of the matters set out in that subsection and, to the extent that such alternative and reasonable provision is made, that provision shall apply instead of that subsection).(3) A notice referred to in subsection (1) shall, save where the means of serving or giving it specified in paragraph (d) is used, be in writing and may be served on or given to the member in one of the following ways:(a) by delivering it to the member;(b) by leaving it at the registered address of the member;(c) by sending it by post in a prepaid letter to the registered address of the member;or(d) if the company’s constitution permits the use of electronic means to serve or give the notice or the conditions specified in subsection (4) are satisfied, by electronic means.(4) The conditions referred to in subsection (3)(d) are—(a) the member has consented in writing to the company, or the officer of it, using electronic means to serve or give notices in relation to him or her;(b) at the time the electronic means are used to serve or give the notice in relation to the member, no notice in writing has been received by the company or the officer concerned from the member stating he or she has withdrawn the consent referred to in paragraph (a); and(c) the particular means used to serve or give the notice electronically are those that the member has consented to.(5) Any notice served or given in accordance with subsection (3) shall be deemed, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary between the company (or, as the case may be, the officer of it) and the member, to have been served or given—(a) in the case of its being delivered, at the time of delivery (or, if delivery is refused, when tendered);(b) in the case of its being left, at the time that it is left;(c) in the case of its being posted (to an address in the State) on any day other than a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, 24 hours after despatch and in the case of its being posted (to such an address)—(i) on a Friday — 72 hours after despatch; or(ii) on a Saturday or Sunday — 48 hours after despatch;(d) in the case of electronic means being used in relation to it, 12 hours after despatch.”.The purpose of these amendments is to improve the ability of companies to service notice in a modern and effective manner.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:00:00+00:00	This section contains the form of directors' compliance statement as recommended by the company law review group. Having analysed the provisions contained in the 2003 Act, the group determined that such extra duties, as set out in the Act, would do little to increase compliance. In fact, it would actually result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to businesses. The set-up cost to a business was estimated at €90,000 with the ongoing annual costs at €40,000. A streamlined version of the directors' compliance statement proposed by the group removed the requirement that the statement included a declaration that the company has complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement, as well as the least relevant as companies are already legally obliged to comply with all Acts. Their inclusion in the statement does not add any substantive duties. A majority of the group, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the statement.There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses without adding value in terms of protection and would disadvantage Ireland competitively as it would go beyond other countries and perhaps beyond the regime north of the Border. The directors' compliance statement as it stands has broad support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve the directors' compliance statement, DCS, as it currently stands within the Bill. On that basis, we do not propose to accept the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 80:
In page 233, to delete lines 34 and 35 and substitute the following:“(10) Any reference in this section to a contract —(a) shall be read as excluding a reference to a contract the decision as to whether to enter into it is taken, or falls to be taken, other than by the board of directors or a committee of which the first-mentioned director in subsection (1) is a member;(b) shall be read as including a reference to any transaction or arrangement, whether or not constituting a contract, but, in a case where the transaction or arrangement does not constitute a contract, a like limitation to that which applies under paragraph (a) applies to the construction of reference provided by this paragraph.”.The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification. The Bill, as it stands, may lead to a misinterpretation that could result in a situation where directors may feel obliged to seek board approval for minor matters such as opening deposit accounts. This was never intended to be the case.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 82:
In page 240, line 32, to delete “private company limited by shares ” and substitute “company formed and registered under this Act or an existing company”.The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarification. The wording as it currently stands is misleading in the context of the overall approach and layout of the Bill and suggests, incorrectly, that company types other than private companies limited by shares are not required to give approval under this section.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 83:
In page 242, to delete lines 8 to 10 and substitute the following:“(b) the amount of a company’s relevant assets shall be determined in accordance with section 239(2); and(c) there shall not be reckoned any arrangement entered into in accordance with the Summary Approval Procedure.”.The purpose of this amendment is to provide exemptions in regard to arrangements which have already been properly approved in accordance with the summary approval procedure.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 84:
In page 245, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:“(7) No approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate unless it is a company formed and registered under this Act, an existing company or a wholly owned subsidiary of a body corporate.”.The purpose of this amendment is to correct an omission. The amendment provides that no approval is required to be given under this section by any body corporate, unless it is a company formed and registered under this Act, an existing company or a wholly owned subsidiary of body corporate. As the Bill stands, subsection (6) of section 28 of the Companies Act 1990 has not been included and the amendment rectifies the position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I am given to understand that a company's tax compliance can be checked out with the Revenue Commissioners, but the Chair may correct me on that. We do not support the amendment, but I believe compliance can be checked.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	Perhaps we can provide some clarification on that. This is not a logical inclusion in a company's financial statements, but the Deputy may have alluded to this in his statement defending the amendment. Financial statements relate to the company's financial performance, not to its tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government was to consider a requirement to require businesses to obtain and publish a certificate of tax compliance, it would do so in tax law, not company law, in order to catch both company and non-company businesses that also pay taxes. The introduction of this requirement would be entirely without precedent across the European Union. It is on that basis the we do not propose to support the amendment. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 86:
In page 270, line 26, after “company’s” to insert “entity”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 87:
In page 273, lines 30 and 31, to delete “a record of all goods purchased, and of all goods sold (except those sold by way of ordinary retail trade)” and substitute “a record of all transactions whereby goods are purchased and whereby goods are sold”.The purpose of these amendments is to make certain that all transactions must be recorded in writing, especially in cash businesses. The proposed change will align the company law requirements with those in regulation 27(1)(b) of the VAT regulations and section 886 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in regard to the keeping of records.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:10:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 88:
In page 274, line 2, to delete “of the services provided or purchased” and substitute “of all transactions whereby services are provided and whereby services are purchased”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	To be helpful, my intention was to suggest we should look into it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	On the face of it, the amendment makes sense, but in the age of cloud computing and remote servers it would place an imposition on businesses because the amount of physical storage facilities they would have to make available could be restrictive if located in city centre locations, for example. Many small offices are located in city centre locations where space is at a premium and would be unable to cope with storing the volume of records that would require to be stored. The amendment would substantially hinder or block outright the use of shared service centres, an area in which Ireland has a particular interest. Since there would be no tangible benefit for any stakeholder and it would be detrimental to Irish commerce, the amendment is - I do not want to use the word "undesirable" - not one we support.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 90:In page 278, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words from and including “assets,” in line 18 down to and including “loss—” in line 19 and substitute the following:“assets, liabilities and financial position, as at the end of the financial year, and profit or loss, for the financial year—”.This is a helpful clarification to ensure the section is consistent with the requirements outlined in the Companies Act 1963. It provides that individual and group accounts shall give a true and fair value of the assets at the end of the financial year and the profit or loss for the financial year for both the company and the group.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	It is a "true and fair value."
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I have three people here who will back me up.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 91:In page 301, line 31, to delete “licensed bank” and substitute “credit institution”.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 146:In page 345, lines 16 to 18, to delete all words from and including “(1) A” in line 16 down to and including “company.” in line 18.The purpose of the amendment is to ensure this exemption which aims to provide small indigenous Irish companies with audit exemptions is not inadvertently given to a small Irish parent company with substantial non-Irish subsidiaries. The proposed amendment deletes subsection (1) which implies that an Irish company with substantial foreign holdings would benefit from the exemption. The policy intention behind the audit exemption is to give benefit to small indigenous companies.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 147:In page 348, line 25, after “undertakings” to insert “(but this paragraph is subject to subsection (6))”.The purpose of this amendment is to make provision for the fact that foreign subsidiaries in a group do not have to file annual returns in the CRO. This amendment is linked with the amendment to section 360.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 148:In page 349, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:“(6) There shall not be reckoned as a subsidiary undertaking for the purposes of this section (other than for the purposes of the expression “subsidiary undertakings” in subsection (2)) an undertaking that is not a company registered under this Act or an existing company and the construction provided for by subsection (1)(a) (of references to each of the relevant bodies) shall be read accordingly.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 149:In page 378, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(2) For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a mortgage or charge created over both—(a) an interest in anything specified in any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of subsection (1); and(b) any property, assets or undertaking not falling within any of those paragraphs, the mortgage or charge shall, other than to the extent to which it is created over an interest in anything specified in any of the foregoing paragraphs of subsection (1), be regarded as a charge within the meaning of this Part.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:20:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 150:In page 381, to delete lines 17 and 18 and substitute the following:“(a) Form 60, 60A or 60B set out in the Schedule of Forms to the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I. No. 483 of 2012) as amended by the Land Registration Rules 2013 (S.I. No. 389 of 2013), or”.The purpose of the amendment is to address any ambiguity there might be as regards the definition of a charge. This section reflects the intent, namely, that charges over cash, deposit accounts, shares, securities and other items listed would not require registration. As the Bill stands, the language is ambiguous, as it could mean that a mortgage or charge, which could involve a number of assets, including, say, one of the excluded ones such as cash, does not have to be registered at all. This was not intended.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-03-25T19:30:00+00:00	I move amendment No. 151:In page 381, to delete lines 27 to 41, and in page 382, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following:“(6) If rules are made under section 126 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 or, as the case may be, section 48 of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006—(a) replacing a form that is referred to in subsection (4)(a)* or (b), as appropriate, the reference in that provision to the form shall be read as a reference to the form as so replaced, or(b) amending a form that is so referred to, the reference in that provision to the form shall be read as a reference to the form as it stands so amended.".As the Bill stands, the reference to form 112 is incorrect since the Land Registration Rules 2012 came into effect. The relevant form is now form 60. The purpose of amendment in deleting subsection (6) is to clarify that the priority of judgment mortgage is governed by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. Closer inspection has shown that in order to achieve the desired result, subsections (7) and (8), both of which relate to subsection (6), also needed to be deleted.Debate adjourned.
