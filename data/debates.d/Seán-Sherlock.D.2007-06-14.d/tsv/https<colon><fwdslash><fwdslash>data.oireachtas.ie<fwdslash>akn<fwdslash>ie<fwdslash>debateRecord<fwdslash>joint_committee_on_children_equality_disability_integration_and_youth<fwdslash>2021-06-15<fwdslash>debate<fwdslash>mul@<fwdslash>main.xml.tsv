[<p eid="para_93">I am in Leinster House. I thank everyone who has made a submission to this process. It has been informative for us, and certainly me.</p>, <p eid="para_94"> I did not expect to be called so soon, as I did not realise that there were so many members missing, but I will start with the many questions that were raised by the Adoption Authority in its opening statement. Does Ms Traynor believe that there are still many questions on resourcing, timeframes and so on that have not been adequately answered in the authority's interactions with the Department on this legislation? I do not want to misinterpret her but it seems that, from her questioning at this meeting, the import is that there are still many unanswered questions in respect of this legislation. Am I right in assuming that or am I reading too much into it from Ms Traynor's submission? She can be as frank as she likes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_96">In its submission, the Adoption Authority wrote:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_97">Can birth parents apply to get their childrenâ€™s birth and adoption records? Could this be included in proposed legislation? The Authority believes that consideration needs to be given on the implications of releasing personal information, for example, a person named as birth father on record which later proves to be incorrect.</p>, <p eid="para_98">What is informing that point? What exactly is Ms Traynor saying there? What is her concern, in plain language?</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">Is there a statistically significant number of examples - and I suppose one is statistically significant in this case - of a person being named as birth father on a record that proves to be incorrect. How many such scenarios has Ms Traynor encountered? How many does she envisage encountering in the future?</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">Mr. O'Mahony made a point on adoption records being dispersed and fragmented between agencies and geographical locations. How would the legislation deal sufficiently with that? What is the solution to that?</p>]
