SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-11-12T15:45:00+00:00	I thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak about Science Week. This week, from 10 to 17 November, Ireland will reverberate with the sights and sounds of science when Science Week 2013 takes place. There is a lot of alliteration in that sentence. Now in its seventh year, Science Week is a national initiative co-ordinated by Science Foundation Ireland's Discover programme that allows everybody to embrace science by way of an enormous range of events taking place the length and breadth of the country. The aim of Science Week is to promote the relevance of science, engineering and technology in our everyday lives and demonstrate the importance of these disciplines to the future development of Irish society and the national economy. The theme of Science Week 2013, Exploring the Extraordinary, provides people with the opportunity to explore what is happening behind the scenes of everyday life and to look at the extraordinary processes that make up the ordinary parts of our lives. Last year more than 200,000 people participated in hundreds of events run by schools, colleges, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout the country. There are more than 770 events registered on the Science Week website for this year and even more events will take place during the week. Despite the pressure on limited resources that everyone faces, Science Week keeps going from strength to strength and every year event organisers have seen a rise in attendance, year on year.  The Discover Science and Engineering, DSE, programme has been a considerable supporter of Science Week during the years. Administration of the DSE programme was taken over by Science Foundation Ireland last year and as the Discover programme, it continues to successfully develop and implement effective ways of engaging students, teachers and the public in the STEM subjects, namely, science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The overall objectives are to increase the numbers of students studying the physical sciences, promote a positive attitude to careers in STEM and foster a greater understanding of science and its value to Irish society. Achieving this requires close interaction with third level institutions and intermediate audiences such as industry and the media. The programme aims to make a co-ordinated effort to increase interest in STEM and encourage young people to consider STEM areas as viable career options. Apart from a comprehensive events and activities programme, the programme's web portal features links to relevant programmes and areas. Some examples of Discover-DSE initiatives are the Discover Primary Science and Maths website, aimed at primary school teachers and pupils; Greenwave, a mass science experiment involving primary schools on the arrival of spring in Ireland; Nanoquest, a project that uses video gaming to encourage 13 to 15 year old school students to develop an interest in nanotechnology and science generally; ESERO, under which Discover partnered with the European Space Agency to establish the European Space Education Resource Office, ESERO, a programme to inspire and engage young people in STEM subjects; ProjectBlogger, a site that allows teachers and second level students in Ireland to create blogs based on their science experiences and interests; My Science Career, a website that brings together resources for finding out more about a career in STEM and includes information on careers in a number of STEM areas, including ICT; science.ie, which provides a wide range of information on science, technology, engineering and mathematics to stimulate young people's interest in these areas; and Smart Futures, a national campaign for second level students in Ireland, highlighting career opportunities in information and communications technology, ICT, in association with the annual e-Skills Week. These are all initiatives capable of exciting, stimulating and inspiring young people, which is exactly what we need to achieve.This is extremely important as the Government remains committed to the vision of using research and innovation to generate jobs and economic growth so that scientific innovation and new technologies will shape the future for the next generation of our students. The jobs agenda is writ large all over this Administration's programme for Government, as we seek to deliver qualified and high-quality personnel to take up jobs in both foreign direct investment enterprise and indigenous enterprise. We are also pursuing the provision of highly skilled employment by repositioning Irish enterprise higher up the value chain. The Government is working towards this vision through many complementary initiatives, one such being research prioritisation. The research prioritisation exercise identified priority areas that will build on Ireland's existing research strengths. They will also have the potential to deliver sustainable economic return through enterprise development, employment growth, job retention and tangible improvements to quality of life. The report of the research prioritisation steering group recommended 14 areas of opportunity, as well as underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas. The areas were identified on the basis of existing strengths of the public research system, existing strengths of the enterprise base, opportunities that exist in the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact, as well as jobs. The report also made 13 systemic recommendations which were required to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the science, technology and innovation, STI, system to support the implementation of prioritisation. The 14 priority areas cover a diverse spectrum of activities including data analytics management, security and privacy, connected health and independent living, food for health, marine renewable energy, and smart grids and smart cities. The Government agreed to the adoption of the research prioritisation steering group's recommendations as a whole-of-government policy goal and with regard to the future alignment of the majority of public STI investment with these 14 areas of opportunity. Following publication of the steering group's report on 1 March 2012, the prioritisation action group, PAG, was established under my chairmanship and political leadership to drive implementation of research prioritisation under the broader authority of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs. The group meets in plenary and has set an ambitious pace for implementation. It is supported by a range of working groups established to progress implementation between plenary sessions. Action plans designed to identify the actions required across research funding organisations to realign the majority of competitive public research funding around the priority areas have been developed for each priority area. Engagement with relevant stakeholders on the draft action plans took place at the end of 2012. The action plans were approved by the Government in June 2013 and published in July 2013. To oversee their implementation in a holistic manner, each action plan has been assigned a champion who, in almost all cases, chaired the relevant working group which developed the plan. This is providing the forum to pave the way for an efficient process for the implementation of the plans. At the first meeting of champions, it was agreed the plans should remain live and evolve over time to ensure they can respond to real-time market developments and opportunities. The PAG will oversee implementation of the plans. Moreover, a detailed framework of metrics and targets has been drawn up as part of research prioritisation to measure the outputs and impact of funding provided, which will comprehend all of the 14 action plans for the respective priority areas. This too was approved by the Government in June 2013. There will also be ongoing monitoring and reporting of developments of the systemic recommendations contained in the report of the research prioritisation steering group. For the second pillar, 13 systemic changes are necessary to support prioritisation by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the STI system. The PAG is also making significant progress.In June 2012 an intellectual property protocol was published outlining new structures to encourage more businesses to commercialise research and development by ensuring they could access the results of State-funded, effectively taxpayer funded, research and development with greater clarity and certainty. The PAG is also considering how application procedures for research funding can be adjusted to assess relevance to, and impact on, priority areas, as well as assessing excellence, with Science Foundation Ireland already leading the way in this regard. In response to recommendations to align supply and demand of trained researchers, the Irish Research Council has rolled out an employment-based PhD and masters programme where awardees will be employees with the majority of time spent in-company. In response to the recommendation that research centres be more industry-focused, on 25 February the largest ever State-industry co-funded research investment was announced. This investment of €300 million is made up of €200 million of Exchequer funding and a €100 million co-investment by over 150 industry partners. This level of industry commitment is sure evidence of the value and potential of the research that will be carried out in each of the seven new world class SFI research centres established. These are research centres of excellence and scale. Under the awards programme, they will be funded over six years, support key growth areas and undertake research into major social challenges, including health, communications and energy. A capability to add "research spokes" around the original "hub" will make them more adaptable to account for changing circumstances and emerging research challenges. To return to Science Week, I cannot over-emphasise how important it is as an annual national awareness raising event. It is an exciting collaboration of events run by colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland. Science Week has become an important event in many people's calendars and it is truly inspirational to see the numbers who turn out and support all of the events each year. Event organisers across the country become actively involved with Science Week each year and it is their dedication and hard work that make the week the success that it is. This year there are new key elements. A new festival in the midlands is bringing top-class exhibitions, workshops and talks, including Trinity College Dublin's Luke O'Neill and Canadian neuroscientist Deborah Saucier, to venues in counties Offaly, Westmeath and Laois. A major new hub is being created in Temple Bar in Dublin this weekend where there will be a free experiential event at the Gallery of Photography, a free family event at Filmbase, a kids' science show at City Hall, as well as physics buskers on the streets. It is also encouraging that, yet again, festivals in Cork, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Waterford and Limerick are all running an extensive programme of events this year. Evidence from research carried out in 2012 by DSE, now the Discover programme, suggested the 18-24 year age cohort still did not consider science and technology industries interesting. Last year Science Week set out to change that perception and follow on, like for like research showed that among that age group interest had increased by 7% in science and 8% in engineering. Most of our children's career opportunities will be built around harnessing new and evolving technologies that are only now establishing themselves. It is critically important that we give students a window into these industries and the experiences of people working in them. It is also vital that we ensure students are engaging in science and scientific thinking at an early age. We must continue to encourage young school students to engage with scientific learning and thinking which, in turn, will encourage them to consider studying STEM subjects at second and third level. Science Week serves as a magnet that continues to attract inquiring young students to the world of science and it stimulates their awareness of the many possibilities and pathways that study in this area will offer them. Therefore, I urge all Senators to check out scienceweek.ie and attend or promote as many events as possible. Not only will they be pleasantly surprised by the huge voluntary effort that has gone into the organisation of the week, but I also guarantee that they will, as I have done, learn and be entertained at the same time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-11-12T16:20:00+00:00	I am already on a bed of nails.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-11-12T17:00:00+00:00	May I clarify something? I did not quite understand what the Senator was referring to when he spoke about some people being one page ahead of others.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-11-12T17:10:00+00:00	I will endeavour to respond in the best way I can to the points raised. I genuinely acknowledge the contributions of my fellow Members of the Oireachtas. Hopefully I will be able to respond, and if I am not, Members should not hesitate to follow up with me. Senator Mary White referred to a dual education system, and I wholeheartedly agree with the point she made. The example of the University of Limerick is the best national example of industry engagement by undergraduates where accreditation is given to the student for participation in industry, enterprise or on a community basis. That model should be replicated. Other universities or institutes of technology should take it as an example. It is for universities to do so, but I am in favour of the model. I will contact Senator Deirdre Clune about a review of the ICT action plan after two years. I want to give an accurate picture of it. The same applies to the PhD candidate to whom Senator Clune referred. A PhD candidate is a student, technically speaking, and I am happy to liaise with the Senator on that issue. I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn on the potential of the agricultural and food sector. It is one of the 14 sectors outlined earlier. We are looking at food, food innovation and, particularly, food for health. Teagasc and SFI have signed a memorandum of understanding to try to leverage new opportunities within the sector, something the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and I signed off on some time ago. It presents an opportunity in terms of mapping areas opportunity onto the food sector and the agricultural sector. This is particularly true in respect of ICT and dairy expansion, where the employment of new ICT technology will be necessary for success. That is where we see a natural synergy between SFI and Teagasc. With regard to GMOs, research on genetically modified organisms is already being carried out by Teagasc. A potato trial is under way within Teagasc. At this juncture, if we look at the trends in terms of global population growth, we must be pragmatic about the approach we take. I am expressing a personal opinion. Sometimes the issue of GMO gets tangled up with the biotechnology companies and the control of seed and intellectual property. We must have a rational and reasonable debate on the issue in a proper forum, devoid of some of the emotion that exists around the topic. I would welcome a rational, coherent and objective debate. There is potential for mapping ICT onto agriculture and developing higher-end food products, particularly in the area of probiotics and functional foods. The taxpayer, through SFI, has funded an alimentary pharma-biotic centre in Cork through Professor Fergus Shanahan, who was referred to by Senator O'Keeffe. Last week, Professor Shanahan was nominated as researcher of the year. That is the kind of excellence in research that we are carrying out in the area of food, and it will map onto dairy expansion and the potential of the agricultural economy. We recognise its importance. The feedback on Science Week will be about capturing what the broadcaster and researcher Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin calls the zeitgeist. She called this a zeitgeist space where learning takes place, through events such as Science Week, for parents and teachers as well as for the children and students involved. It is about implanting new ideas in teachers to apply some of the learning from individual events in the classroom. In terms of feedback, the expectation is that teachers will take something from the events and implant that learning in the teaching experience within the classroom. There is no reason, in the current system, they cannot do so. The topic of religion in schools concerns management and patronage structures. It is arguably for a board of management to determine the particular ethos of the school. That is why, in certain instances, religion becomes an important topic, depending on the ethos in a school. I agree that we need more primary school teachers engaging with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects at primary school. We must help teachers. All too often, it is easy to be critical of teachers and say that they spend too much time teaching English or art and not enough time on science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects. We must create a supportive framework for teachers and give them the tools to do so. Senator Thomas Byrne referred to physical sciences and hard sciences. Looking at the results in physics and chemistry, one can see there is no difference between the genders at national level. With regard to the school in question, I do not know the facts of the situation, but I imagine it may be a geographical issue or a localised issue. There are opportunities for people to be taught physics or chemistry no matter where they are in the country. If there are exceptions, I would like to hear about it. It may be a local variation. If we examine the breakdown of physics and chemistry in the leaving certificate, we find that, broadly speaking, there is no gender imbalance. I am happy to talk to the Senator about that point.  I was delighted to meet Senator Colm Burke at the medical research charities group conference this morning. We are a small country and we are still borrowing more than €1 billion per month. It is not possible for a small country in these economically constrained times to try to be all things to all people in terms of our research funding. It is appropriate to smartly specialise in an area in which we can get a societal and economic return. People may have a rational critique of the research prioritisation exercise, but I do not believe they cannot be funded through other sources if they feel they are left outside of the process. There are sources of funding other than research prioritisation. In the health area, in drug synthesis and drug formulation, Ireland is investing heavily through the solid state pharmaceutical centre, SSPC, cluster at the University of Limerick, which brings in the pharmaceutical companies so vital to our industrial landscape. We are partnering with them through SFI to examine the concept of manufacturing from molecules to medicine, as the saying goes. We must be smart about how we specialise. Drug discovery is an area of importance.We recognise that. If we are talking about an emphasis on these, we will be moving towards a manufacturing and processing synthesis crystallisation space. We are absolutely right to prioritise in that area. There were comments about 0% corporation tax. Considering the foreign direct investment wins we have had in 2012, approximately 45% were predicated on research and development. I have an open mind on the corporate tax rate and, as a Minister of State, that type of designation is probably beyond my pay grade. We should debate the matter and I acknowledge the points made by Senator Barrett on how the research and development tax credit is utilised. The last budget set down clear markers on the research and development tax credit designation and there is no ambiguity about that. Senator Crown mentioned religion and I spoke about governance in response to that. Science is a core subject, which I agree with, and the metrics would probably indicate that science is taught at post-primary level in approximately 85% to 90% of schools. I could stand to be corrected on the exact percentage, and although it is an option, science is still taken by the vast majority of students right up to leaving certificate level. I agree with the Senator that this is about people having a basic conceptual understanding of science because of its translational impact across a number of sectors, including solicitors and the other professions mentioned. I agree with the Senator's comments about a core module. I do not see how the junior cycle could not provide for that kind of model, especially in short courses, and junior cycle students on short courses should be engaged in that kind of scientific inquiry. The idea might be grown from the conceptual perspective of "putting the finger on the hot plate", as people should have such a conceptual understanding of scientific endeavour. There would be an important outcome for people downstream in terms of how they grow, effectively, as people. With regard to the food space, the Alimentary Pharmobiotic Centre in Cork is working with Teagasc, and it is one of the foremost probiotic research entities in the world. It carries out research on functional foods, gut health and mapping the gut "genome". Ireland is at the forefront of that scientific endeavour, and downstream permutations will include medicinal potential for food as a delivery mechanism. That is long-term thinking, with people like Professor Fergus Shanahan leading that kind of research. I will never forget the name Nicholas Callan as long as I live. The next time I step on the locomotive to Mallow or into the car, I will be thinking of Reverend Professor Nicholas Callan. I take that as a learning point and acknowledge the comments of Senator Moran in that respect. Senator Barrett always provokes challenging thoughts and I like coming to the Seanad because it facilitates such debate. Senator Barrett drew on the "one page ahead" analogy with regard to Project Maths and the State is expending considerable resources on bringing teachers of mathematics - out of field maths teachers - through a professional diploma which is being delivered by the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, in collaboration with other entities like the National University of Ireland, Galway. We have invested heavily in bringing in those teachers and the taxpayer is funding this professional diploma in order to upskill the teachers and enable them to teach mathematics at post-primary level. I would be very surprised if the vast majority of teachers graduating from that course would not leap-frog some of the existing pure mathematics teachers in the system. That may sound controversial but it is what the evidence indicates, although we have not yet had a full analysis of how the course panned out. In fairness to teachers in the post-primary sector, they have had to embrace serious challenges in dealing with Project Maths and some of the teachers have been resistant to it. I am confident that given the right levels of continuing professional development and supports for those teachers, as well as introducing the out of field mathematics teachers into the equation, some of the issues with the State Examinations Commission will be solved. Everybody acknowledges the turmoil created but we must still acknowledge that Project Maths is still in its early days, so there is work to be done. There are still pockets of resistance by some teachers involved with Project Maths and we are trying to work with them as best we can in order to get through the existing issues, recognising the challenges they face. A teacher has to go from "chalk and talk" based on a model of past papers to a process of collaborative problem solving with students, and some teachers may have been teaching for 20 or 25 years. We must acknowledge that such a change can be difficult for teachers. I am hopeful that we can get through those challenges and I acknowledge the points. I do not agree with the Senator's comments about a culture of amateurism. He was speaking specifically about pyrite issues and so forth. I will stand up for the officials with whom I interface in the public service on a daily basis. One can consider the negotiations around Horizon 2020, and although they have political leadership, the teams on the working groups are all public officials. These are civil servants who did an excellent job in negotiating these programmes on behalf of Ireland. I know the Senator is not painting with a broad brush with regard to public administration but sometimes we must acknowledge that there are excellent people within our public administration who have a very strong sense of policy outcomes and delivering based on Government objectives, etc. I do not know if I missed an issue when the Senator mentioned the culture of amateurism, and I stand to be corrected if I have missed a point. Some 45% of our foreign direct investment wins last year were predicated on research and development. The challenge for us is to start examining the primary school system now to ensure we can have a throughput. There are intermediate measures at post-primary level, and I argue there is a certain responsibility on higher education institutions to start remodelling how they offer particular courses. Perhaps there is an onus on the institutions to consider the possibilities of more industrial engagement by undergraduates. If that is done there will be a positive consequence on the numbers of people staying here rather than emigrating, and particularly with people under 24 who are freshly graduated. At this stage, if those people had some sort of industrial experience or could interface with industry in some way at an undergraduate level, receiving accreditation for their efforts, many might take up opportunities at an earlier career stage.I remain open to challenge on that point also at some stage.
