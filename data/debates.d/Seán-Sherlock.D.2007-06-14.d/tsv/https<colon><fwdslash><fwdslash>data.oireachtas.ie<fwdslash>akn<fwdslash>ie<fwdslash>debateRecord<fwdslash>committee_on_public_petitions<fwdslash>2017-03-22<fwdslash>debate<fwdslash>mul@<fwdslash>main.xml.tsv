SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T13:40:00+00:00	The next item on our agenda is an engagement with the Financial Services Ombudsman. Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones. I welcome Mr. Ger Deering, the Financial Services Ombudsman, and Ms Elaine Cassidy, deputy Financial Services Ombudsman. I thank them for coming before the committee. The Joint Committee on Public Petitions received a petition from Mr. David Geary entitled "Financial Ombudsman Review", petition No. P00035/16. As part of its deliberation of this petition, the committee considered a response from the Financial Services Ombudsman and agreed at its meeting of 25 January 2017 to close the petition. However, it was further agreed to invite the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Deering, to appear before the committee to discuss the three-year change programme currently in operation. Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to advise everyone here that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind our guests that their opening presentations should be of ten minutes' duration or less. Members have been given a copy of the presentation that was submitted to the committee. I now invite Mr. Deering to make his opening statement.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:00:00+00:00	The Senator has the floor. She can take that forward in the context of the Bill she is proposing on another day but my instinct is to give people the floor and as much time as they need.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:20:00+00:00	I have one or two questions. What was the total number of complaints in 2016?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:20:00+00:00	So 2,491 were resolved. Have complainants the right to legal representation?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:20:00+00:00	What is the modality of the dispute resolution service? If I make a complaint as a citizen, I am contacted by the ombudsman's office. What happens then?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Can the Financial Services Ombudsman requisition documents and telephone records from the banks in dealing with a person's complaint?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Mr. Deering has mentioned that a new step has been added to the process - preliminary findings.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Have they ever differed from the final determination or decision?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Okay.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Is the legislative lacuna impeding the embedding of the two offices?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	Has the Financial Services Ombudsman been given a definitive timeline for implementation of the legislation?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	With members' agreement, we will ask the relevant Department why there is a hold up in progressing the drafting of the legislation. I am not aware that we have even received the heads of a Bill at this stage.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	October 2016.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	I am member of that committee. Mea culpa.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	That is fair enough. I recall it now. Please forgive me. We have a new development in the motor industry regarding the provision of 0% finance. The personal contract plan, PCP, is one model and there are others. I have anecdotal evidence that people have taken out a PCP product. It is so prevalent at this stage that I do not think I will offend anybody by naming the brand. The anecdotal evidence I have been hearing is that after people have paid the interest and it comes to paying back the principal, they get the shock of their lives because they never read the small print. They then realise they must pay a capital amount in financing the car. Have the delegates received complaints of this nature or have they had any interaction with the finance houses on ensuring customers of these products have absolute knowledge of what they are buying into and what the permutations will be at the end of the lifetime of these products?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-03-22T14:30:00+00:00	I thank the delegates very much for giving of their time. The meeting has been very informative.
