SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I ask the Taoiseach to report on the progress of the decentralisation of Fáilte Ireland to Mallow and Bus Éireann to Mitchelstown.  These two towns, which have been decimated by job losses, held high expectations of the decentralisation process and made many preparatory plans.  There has been no reporting on the decentralisation process as it pertains to these towns and we would like to know what exactly is going on.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the delay by the HSE in intervening to allow a number of people access to vital services at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and, in particular, to examine the policy that prevents a 12 year old girl access to hospital care to allow her to undergo a vital operation, given that she has been waiting for over six months.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If the people of County Louth have been waiting since April, the people of Mallow and the north Cork community have been waiting two and a half years for a CT scanner to become operational.  We need the staff to make it operational.  Will the Minister appoint the necessary staff?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It relates to the policy on how CT scanners are rolled out.
