[<p eid="para_62">Not meaning in any way to be facetious, this document, read objectively, is like an advertisement for waste incineration, and let us not put too fine a point on that.  I start from that base point and say so objectively.</p>, <p eid="para_63">In the first contribution made, it was stated "That such a banned product would be used in the first place, be it by accident or design, is now a subject of investigation."  Where does it state that the product which was used in the plant in Wexford was a banned product?  When, at a previous hearing on this matter, I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food whether it was a banned product, I could not get a straight answer.  He told me the plant concerned should have been the subject of HACCP legislation and should have been notified as to the types of products being used in the process.  Nobody has been able to clarify whether the use of such oil was covered by a regulation in the first instance and my layman's view is that it is not covered by a regulation.  Perhaps Mr. Ahern could clarify his point in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_64">I seek Mr. Ahern's view on this.  In his submission he spoke about this happening after the fact, in essence.  We are trying to achieve an enhanced regime that would prevent any type of incineration or the need for such incidence because the regulatory regime would be sacrosanct in the first instance and would apply to all of the stakeholders who are food producers or FPOs.  It would not even need to get to a point of incineration.</p>, <p eid="para_65">It is easy to cite examples like the Belgian dioxin scare and the recent food scare to promote incineration here.  I question the necessity for this submission.  Unless Mr. Ahern can tell us how we could effect a proper regulatory regime that ensures this does not happen again — from the outset of a process in terms of food production and not after the fact — frankly, we are wasting our time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_71">On a point of order, our guests stated that they are signatories to the Stockholm Convention and referred to PCB oil being phased out.  Is that a binding or non-binding legal arrangement?  One could be a stakeholder signing up to a non-binding arrangement.  However, unless this is supported by a legal provision, one will get nowhere.  I am trying to establish whether the substance involved in this case was, in the context of the facility in question, a banned or illegal substance.  I have not been able to clarify the position in that regard.  Perhaps Ms Keaney might enlighten me.</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">On a point of clarification, we are not Luddites in this committee; we are fairly open-minded in our approach to these matters.  As a layman I realise that we cannot keep burying waste.  It is just not feasible.</p>, <p eid="para_112">I wish to pick up on what Senator Boyle stated.  It leaves me a little confused as to the Government policy on the incineration of waste.  I hope someone can clarify it for me.  If I interpret Senator Boyle's statements correctly, then the MBT process is the only process in town and not the waste to incineration or waste to energy incineration as envisaged by Indaver Ireland and other such companies.  What is the Government position?  I suspect Senator Boyle's comments are informed by the fact that there is a proposal for Ringaskiddy, which is in his constituency, and perhaps he is playing a little to the gallery in that respect.</p>, <p eid="para_113">I refer to a specific comment about the dioxins.  This is a process of education for me.  Can the dioxins be contained within the facility in a safe manner?  In the mind of the public, the word "dioxins" is both emotive and potent, conjuring up all sorts of images.  I take the point made by the delegation that we ingest or consume dioxins or are exposed to them in our everyday lives and this is not disputed.  However, can a high concentration of dioxins being produced in a very specific geographical confine, for instance, 20,000 tonnes per annum in County Meath, be contained on site or stored under rigorous conditions?  If such questions are answered this will ease the public mind in some respect.  To return to my essential point about the context of the submission and the pork crisis, I think this submission should be made in another context.</p>]
