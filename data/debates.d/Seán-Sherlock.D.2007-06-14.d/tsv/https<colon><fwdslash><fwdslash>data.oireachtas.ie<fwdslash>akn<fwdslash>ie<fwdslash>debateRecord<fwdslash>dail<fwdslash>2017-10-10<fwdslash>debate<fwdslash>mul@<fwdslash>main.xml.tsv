[<p eid="para_655">I support the resolution without question. I wish to speak briefly on the issue of smoking cessation and public health policy in that regard, particularly with regard to the cost of nicotine replacement therapies. In his annual consideration of matters relating to the rates of tax on tobacco products, will the Minister give consideration to the cost of nicotine replacement therapies? There is a myriad of products sold in pharmacies at exorbitant prices. I do not know if the pharmacies are price takers from the pharmaceutical sector in this regard but the products available are extremely costly. It has been argued that one is replacing one addiction with another. I ask the Government to consider further examination of the sheer cost people incur when they are trying to give up smoking by moving to nicotine replacement therapies. The cost of those therapies should be examined as a matter of urgency.</p>]
