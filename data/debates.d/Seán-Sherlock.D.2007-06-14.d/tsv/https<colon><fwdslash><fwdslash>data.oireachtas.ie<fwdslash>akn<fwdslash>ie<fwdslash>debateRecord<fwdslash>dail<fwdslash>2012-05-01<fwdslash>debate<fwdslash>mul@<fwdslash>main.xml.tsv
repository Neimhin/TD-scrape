SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  I reiterate my concern at the treatment of this young person which is completely at variance with any republican principle to which we adhere as democrats.  The manner in which this young person was treated was also un-Christian.  I sympathise with her and agree with the Deputies.I can confirm to the House that the Department and the Minister take this matter very seriously.  On foot of correspondence from the Ombudsman for Children, the Department has initiated an inspection of the school concerned and that inspection is ongoing.  The first part involved an unannounced incidental inspection visit which took place in February.  A second inspection visit will be completed this month.  It is expected that the report on the inspection will be completed before the end of June.  In order not to prejudice the outcome of the inspector's report, I do not propose to comment further on the specific case.  That is not to fudge the issue, but in respect of enrolments generally, the current position is that every school is legally obliged to publish its enrolment policy in such a manner as the board, with the agreement of the patron, considers appropriate.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeals process where a board of management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, it is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.The Minister has made the issue of reform of enrolment in schools a priority since taking up office.  Last June he published a discussion document on school admissions aimed at leading to changes in regulations and legislation on how primary and post-primary schools allocated places to students.  Central to the question of enrolment is the need to ensure a fair and transparent system in all schools which does not discriminate unfairly against students or parents.  The discussion paper on a regulatory framework for school enrolment contains suggestions on how the process of enrolling in schools can be made more open, equitable and consistent.  The has made it clear that the paper was not meant to be prescriptive, nor have any decisions been made as to what elements will be contained in any final regulations or legislation.  The purpose of the paper was to lead and provoke debate on enrolment policies and practices.Education partners and interested parties were invited to submit their views to the Department by 28 October last and officials are co-ordinating the submissions received.  The feedback from this consultation will help inform the nature and scope of a new regulatory framework for school enrolment.  The Minister intends to bring legislative proposals to Government this year, the primary aim of which will be to ensure every child is treated fairly and has a place at school.I hope this answer is an adequate response to the questions raised by the Deputies.  There is no timeframe for the legislation.  With regard to enrolment policy, there should be no distinction between publicly and privately funded schools.  That is a personal opinion.  If we cherish all the children equally, where they go to school should not affect how they are treated.  That is a personal view but it is one I would articulate in any legislative piece and I have made my view known to the Minister
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputies for their considered views on the issue.  All education stakeholders throughout the land would look with empathy on this case.  There is sense of empathy for the girl given the manner in which she was treated.  This example is an aberration in the system.  A decision was taken by one school.  The system and its stakeholders, by its nature, is empathetic and deals positively with people in all sorts of circumstances.I take the points made about the need for greater co-ordination at departmental level.  That is something that could be worked through the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Perhaps an initiative could arise out of those meetings that have taken place.The Minister has made it very clear that discrimination of this nature is unacceptable.  We would all agree with that position and I restate it.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Doyle, Keaveney, Jim Daly and McNamara.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am proud to be present today because it is the first anniversary of the announcement by the then president of the Labour Party, Mr. Michael D. Higgins, of his candidacy for the office of President of Ireland.  With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will quote from his statement of that day:The Labour Party is the oldest party in Ireland and was founded in the year before one of the greatest confrontations between labour and capital in the history of the Irish State, the great lock-out in Dublin of 1913.He goes on to say:What was then a poverty stricken and vulnerable movement of labour sought to organise against a version of capitalism that refused the most basic rights to workers, including the very right to organise.  That confrontation required courage, tenacity, solidarity and, above all, a commitment to class and history beyond the short-term challenges.  We should never forget that.  To this day we are the beneficiaries of the struggle of the labour movement of 1913.  Moreover, as their heirs we are required to make an analysis of our own difficult times to craft a strategy and to deliver our view of an alternative society with a sustainable and productive connection between economy and society in the institutions that can deliver it.That man, thankfully, is now President of Ireland.  I am proud to be here to say we are continuing, to the best of our ability, on his legacy and vision.On the legislation, and that particular vision, given the day that is in it, I was glad to see the pupils of the Presentation primary school of Doneraile in the Gallery because we must have regard to their future.  It is precisely in the vision set out by persons dating back to 1913, and through persons like President Michael D. Higgins, that such narrative continues.  We do our best to ensure there is a future for those children.The plight of employees in the current economic environment is foremost in the deliberations of Government as it seeks to stimulate the creation of jobs and a return to economic growth.  Various high-profile cases that have been widely reported in the media highlight the precarious nature of employment in some sectors at present and the need to ensure vulnerable employees are treated fairly by employers and their complaints adequately adjudicated by the appropriate employment rights bodies of the State.No doubt the proposed Bill under discussion here this evening is well intended.  However, it is impractical in its scope and in terms of what it seeks to achieve.  Ultimately, it could serve only to expose the taxpayer and employers to additional burdens while also, ironically, acting as a chill factor to the creation of vitally necessary new employment in the State.  We need only go back to one of the original EU directives of 1998 in this area which notes the need "for balanced economic and social development" within the EU.The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the processing of claims under the redundancy payments scheme and the insolvency payments scheme.  The insolvency payments scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 and is designed to protect certain outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  Such entitlements include wages, holiday pay, sick pay, payment in lieu of minimum notice due under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 and certain pension contributions.  The scheme comprises a one-off payment in respect of outstanding debts to employees in respect of their legitimate employment entitlements subject to certain limits.The insolvency payments scheme and the redundancy payments scheme are two separate schemes, but they are both paid from the social insurance fund.  In 2011, €18.5 million was paid from the insolvency payments scheme in respect of outstanding pay-related entitlements due to employees.The Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor against the assets of an employer in respect of most amounts paid under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 - the House will forgive me if this sounds technical, but I want to answer each of the points addressed in the Bill.  The distribution of the assets to creditors, including the Minister, is subject to the legislation and rules governing the winding-up of companies.  While an insolvent company, by definition, cannot meet its liabilities, the level of assets available for distribution can vary greatly.  The Minister may receive a dividend or be paid in full if there are sufficient funds in the liquidation/receivership.  All reimbursements made to the Minister by the liquidator from the assets of the company are returned to the social insurance fund.Sinn Féin, in proposing this Bill, seeks to widen the scope of insolvency to effectively allow an employee to render a company insolvent, by amending a provision of the 1984 Act.  The legislation currently in place provides for the recognition of companies becoming insolvent in circumstances such as where the employer has been adjudicated bankrupt; where the employer has filed a petition for, or has executed, a deed of arrangement within the meaning of section 4 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act 1887; where the employer has died and his or her estate, being insolvent, is being administered in accordance with the rules set out in Part I of the First Schedule to the Succession Act 1965; where the employer is a company, a winding up order is made or a resolution for voluntary winding up is passed with respect to it; where a receiver or manager of an undertaking is duly appointed, or possession is taken, by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by any floating charge, of any property of the company comprised in or subject to the charge; and where the employer is of a class or description specified in regulations under section 4(2) of this Act which are for the time being in force and the circumstances specified in the regulations as regards employers of such class or description obtain in relation to him.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I beg the indulgence of my colleagues on this one.  If they are amenable to allowing me, I want to address the points in the legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I appreciate that and thank my colleagues.  I want to ensure we address the legislation before us.The current legislation also ensures that insolvency payments are paid to employees in respect of unpaid debts, such as wages and holiday pay, from the social insurance fund and protects employees' entitlements in the event of an insolvency.  Liquidation, the most common status pertaining to insolvency, is a permanent irreversible condition whereas the trading status of a company may change significantly depending on its circumstances.  In the circumstances, it is not necessary to include a new category regarding the cessation of trading as part of the insolvency payments scheme.On the proposed amendment of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, I am satisfied the current provisions, contained in section 7 of the Act, are sufficient for this purpose.  The current legislation facilitates access to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the proposed amendment of section 9 is not necessary, given the reform process underway in respect of the employment rights adjudication bodies of the State.Sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, as amended, make it mandatory on employers proposing a collective redundancy to engage in an information and consultation process with employees' representatives and to provide certain information relating to the proposed redundancies.  An employer is prohibited from issuing any notice of redundancy during the mandatory minimum 30-day employee information and consultation period.  The existing legislation provides for a range of sanctions to be applied against an employer where he or she fails to meet the information and consultation obligations under the Act, whereby failure to comply with section 9 on failure to consult or section 10 on failure to provide certain information, may result in a fine of up to €5,000.  Section 12 of the Act makes it mandatory for an employer to notify the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of his or her intention to create collective redundancies at least 30 days prior to the first dismissal taking effect.As I have indicated, while the thrust behind the legislation may be well intended, ultimately, this Bill is impractical and crucially may expose the taxpayer and the wider economy to major unintended consequences. There are two main difficulties with the Bill.  The 90-day consultation period for large companies is unrealistic and is inconsistent with the flexibility needed by companies to make decisions on restructuring and change.  The one certainty is that by imposing a consultation period as long as 90 days, the rule will be honoured more in the breach than in the observance.  Equally, it could involve a prolonged period of uncertainty for employees, some of whom may be discouraged from remaining with a particular employer in what would be an artificially extended period of doubt.The proposed period of 90 days is significantly greater than in most other EU member states.  Significantly, the UK's Department of Business, Innovation and Skills is also actively evaluating the relevance of the continued application of the 90-day provision in the context of its own economic circumstances.The proposal surrounding the circumstances of a company ceasing trading and the granting of redundancy payments is overly simplistic and potentially lets the employer off the hook for what he or she should be rightfully paying by way of redundancy payments.  The proposal has the potential to encourage abuse by employers and will expose the taxpayer to costs that he or she should not have to bear.I ask the House to bear in mind those companies that are operating outside of this jurisdiction.  It must be also recognised that several of the cases that have given rise to this Bill concern a small number of intractable scenarios where sudden wind-ups have occurred as the result of court orders, many of which have been extra-jurisdictional, typically in the UK, and no consultation or information period whatsoever - be it 30 days or 90 days - takes place.  An extended notification period to employees in such difficult and atypical circumstances would be of limited use in seeking to improve the circumstances of affected employees.  The existing 30 day information and consultation period and the 30 day notification period to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have served the State well for more than 30 years and neither employer nor employee representatives have ever sought their amendment.  This is because, in the majority of normal collective redundancy situations, employers comply with the required information and consultation period, specifically that no dismissals take effect within a 30 day period.In fact, in practice, the notice period provided in proposed collective redundancies very often exceeds the minimum statutory provision.  A representative sample of redundancy notifications received by the Minister in 2012 shows that a majority of employees in collective redundancy situations already receive in excess of 30 days' notice that redundancies are planned for the company.  More than 65% of the notifications provided for a minimum period of six weeks before the first redundancy was due to occur, while 50% provided for a minimum period of two months before the first redundancy was due to take place.  Even in redundancy situations that did not provide for more than the minimum 30 day information and consultation period for some employees, the redundancies were often proposed on a phased basis, with many employees receiving longer notice of the planned redundancies.Existing legislative provisions contained in the Protection of Employment Act 1977 allow for National Employment Rights Authority inspectors, as authorised officers of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to carry out inspections to establish whether the Act is being complied with.  I would encourage any employees who believe their employer has not complied with the requirements of the legislation to make a complaint to the authority under the provisions of the Act.The Government is strongly committed to the protection of employees and the enhancement of their employment rights.  This commitment is most in evidence in the reform of the statutory workplace relations structures and processes initiated by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  He is committed to delivering a world class workplace relations service.  His main aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period of time.  Substantial progress has already been delivered in this regard.  A key element of the next phase of reform will be the delivery of a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision makers.I am aware I have gone beyond my allocated time, so I will leave it at that.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) is an international trade agreement that aims to help countries work together to tackle more effectively large-scale Intellectual Property Rights violations by clamping down on counterfeiting and piracy. It aims to strike a fair balance between the interests of the parties concerned, including citizens, consumers, civil society and business; and to guarantee all safeguards and exemptions provided by existing or European norms, such as fundamental rights, privacy and freedom of speech.  Ireland, along with 21 other Member States signed ACTA on 26 January 2012.Following public concerns regarding ACTA, the Commission has decided to refer the Agreement to the Court of Justice of the European Union to assess whether it is in any way incompatible with the EU's fundamental principles in particular with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Commission Legal Service is currently finalising the written submission that will accompany the question.MEPs are democratically elected to represent the citizens of the European Union and act independently in that role in the EU Parliament. As a Member of the European Parliament and a representative of the people of Europe, it is their responsibility to fully inform themselves of the merit of this Agreement for the people of Europe prior to any vote. Accordingly, my Department is available to provide MEPs with background briefing should that be required.
