SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	I thank the witnesses for being here today. This meeting is certainly assisting us in understanding the dynamic between the IFCA, the people it represents, and officialdom. How would the witnesses characterise the IFCA's relationship with Tusla? Is it a positive relationship? Does the IFCA leadership feel it is being listened to and its recommendations are bearing some fruit?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	The witnesses noted that foster carers do not have a link social worker. That suggests to me that there is a big gap. The foster carer and the child have the right to a social worker. Could the risk increase dramatically if the relationship between the carer and the child deteriorates in any way? If we do not have an accurate figure for how many of the 5,000 children in foster care arrangements are without a link social worker, there is a possible or potential risk of some of those relationships being in a state of disrepair. We might not know that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	The theme here is recruitment and retention. We are trying to plug that gap, so to speak. If there is no link social worker for a particular family and issues arise for the foster carer or the child, the risk is offset by a mechanism allowing the foster carer to contact the IFCA via the helpline. Does recourse exist for a child where he or she is at risk? We assume the relationship is benign and positive and we concur with Ms Bond about the good work done by people who care for children in a fostering arrangement. We have to have regard, however, to the fact that if there is a shortage of social workers, the risk profile increases and child protection issues become even more prevalent. If there are 5,000 children in foster care arrangements, and like the witnesses we do not have exact figures, there is a major gap in the service and the risk to children is potentially increased. That is my impression. Perhaps the witnesses can disavow me of that or help me to understand further.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	If I understand Mr. Murphy correctly, some foster carers do not have a link social worker and as such they do not have access to supports as required. If I interpret that correctly, he is saying there are gaps. Does the IFCA have a numerical analysis of the gaps? How many children are without a link social worker at present?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	There is nobody in the system who is literally cast adrift.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	This discussion is all about developing our understanding of the dynamic. Who exactly is on the foster care committee?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:40:00+00:00	I refer again to recruitment and retention. The former Deputy Pat Rabbitte is now chair of Tusla. He came before the committee some weeks ago and the recruitment and retention of social workers was a key area that he wanted to discuss. In parallel with the IFCA, he also raised bridging education that would upskill social care staff. If people have identified this as an issue that has been ongoing for many years, why has the system not bridged that gap? Why is it that instead of going back into full-time education, social care staff cannot do a bridging or postgraduate course that would see them suitably qualified? What is the IFCA's perception of the gaps there? Why has that not happened?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:50:00+00:00	It was suggested that bursaries could be provided by Tusla.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:50:00+00:00	Demand for foster care places is increasing. The figures are approximately 6,000 in care and 5,000 in foster care. How do we encourage people to become foster carers or foster parents, to use that expression? Where is the gap and why are more people not taking up that challenge?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T10:50:00+00:00	Would Ms Bond characterise the challenges that foster carers face at the moment as being extremely difficult in the main? The perception I have is that for foster carers, the placement can be quite difficult if they do not have supports. Presumably foster carers are constantly fighting with the HSE and Tusla for additional services.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:40:00+00:00	I sincerely thank the witnesses for being here today. Five minutes do not do justice to the wider submission IFCA supplied to the committee and I sincerely thank them for articulating a way forward for us, as a committee, to deal with the issues of recruitment and retention. I also thank Ms McGuirk for defending her colleagues because we live in times where it is easy to beat up on the social worker and he or she, in a judicial or societal setting, can be seen as the easy target for public opprobrium. While there have been cases in the recent past and historically, relating to the quality of engagement with social workers, that was the exception and not the norm. I have an appreciation on the basis of the submission and our deliberations on this issue of recruitment and retention generally, that it is the hidden work, which is undocumented, defines the quality of the engagement. One cannot put a HIQA, stamp on or tick a box for the relationship building, which is vital to sustain the very system that we have. Again, I thank the witnesses for their attendance here today and for their important submission because we now have something on which we can roll up our sleeves. I would like to be educated on the day-to-day role of a social worker. My first question is on child protection and the welfare of children. We have had a very good interaction on foster care but I want to better understand how a case is triaged when it comes in the front door of Tusla or any other agency. How does a child protection case land on the desk of a social worker? We have a good interaction on foster care but I would like to discuss child protection. How does a social worker, typically, secure a care order? Where is the social worker in the pecking order in respect of the legal framework to secure a care order? Let us say a social worker must go to court. What does a typical social worker have to do from the time a case lands on the desk front-of-house to securing a care order? How much paperwork is involved? Once the care order is successfully applied for, what is the ratio of contact time to administrative time? Is it 50:50 or 80:20? Does a social worker now have to do much more administrative work with much less contact time? Is that, within the existing cohort of social workers, having a bearing on outcomes for the relationship between the social worker and the child? Has that contributed to a malaise or a set of circumstances whereby a social worker, after a couple of years, faces burnout and decides to leave his or her post citing an inability to deal with the work any more? How can the nature of the relationship be changed in such a way that there is a larger quotient of social workers, a manageable workload and family-friendly hours? Social work is a female dominated profession. Women, in particular, will inevitably have families. What arrangements are put in place for a female social worker who wants to continue in her profession yet wants the requisite time off and work within hours that meet the needs of her own family while allowing her to continue professionally, progress careerwise and so on?  I have offloaded a load of issues. I have a picture in my own mind about social work but the witnesses will present a picture that will help us to deal with the key issues of recruitment and retention. I ask them to paint a picture for us of some of the points that I have outlined it will prove very useful. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:50:00+00:00	The local elections are coming if Mr. McCarthy wants to put on the jersey.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:50:00+00:00	I appreciate the point that Mr. McCarthy is making, but to assist us and notwithstanding the fact that I made a lot of points to him earlier, where for instance a case comes in, is triaged and goes on for further assessments, if the case goes to court and a care order is required, I have a number of questions arising from that. I will be as brief as possible, allowing for the amount of time I have available, and forgive me if I took a lot of time at the start. What is the status of the social worker in the court setting? What is the contact time versus the administrative time? I would like to have an understanding of those two dynamics from our committee's interaction today with the Irish Association of Social Workers. The new chair of Tusla spoke about bridging courses to get people from social care to social work. What are the views of the association on that suggestion? How are academia and Tusla dealing with this idea? Everybody has acknowledged and knows the problem of recruitment. Should we be putting better therapeutic solutions and counselling in place for social workers themselves who work in child protection settings? Should we be designing family friendly policies for social workers? All of these thematic areas could contribute to a better outcome for social workers themselves and, ultimately and most importantly, for children and families.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:50:00+00:00	Okay.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:50:00+00:00	Is the social worker, however, subject to cross-examination?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T11:50:00+00:00	There is massive element of stress involved in that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T12:00:00+00:00	However, they are represented by a solicitor.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T12:00:00+00:00	My understanding is developing now. If the social worker goes into court he or she is represented in an adversarial system. Presumably, the social worker historically would have made the assessment and made a recommendation that the child should go into whatever setting is the most appropriate. Historically, that would have been accepted by the judge of the day. I am assuming this and Mr. McCarthy can correct me if I am wrong. We now have a system where there is a guardian ad litem and a social worker. Presumably the guardian ad litem has legal representation, the social worker has legal representation, the child is represented by the guardian ad litem and then there is the respondent. There could be five or six lawyers and probably a layer of experts on top of that again. There could be a psychologist or psychiatrist in the court. Is Mr. McCarthy saying that the psychologist or psychiatrist - he can tell us which is the appropriate profession - is then tasked with doing the assessment of the need or of the parent before a judgment is made?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T12:00:00+00:00	I have several more questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T12:00:00+00:00	That is fine.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-27T12:10:00+00:00	They are publicly tendered so it is a matter of public record, with all due respect.
