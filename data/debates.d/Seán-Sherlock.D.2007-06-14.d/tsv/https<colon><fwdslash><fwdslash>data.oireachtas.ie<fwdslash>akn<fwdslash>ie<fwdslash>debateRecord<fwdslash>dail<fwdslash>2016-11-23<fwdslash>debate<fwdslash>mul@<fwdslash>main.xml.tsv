[<p eid="para_403">The European Union has invested significantly in buildings and services in the West Bank. Up to June 2016, the Israeli military has demolished up to $74 million worth of EU-funded structures. Is Ireland's policy and, by extension, that of the European Union sustainable? Do we have the means to influence an outcome to stop this deliberate Israeli policy?</p>]
[<p eid="para_408">By any objective analysis Irish Aid on the ground and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been proactive in directly assisting communities in the West Bank and across Palestine over many years. There is an area called Area C comprising 60% of the West Bank. The Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, which is co-ordinated by the World Council of Churches, claims that Israel retains near-exclusive control, including over law enforcement, planning and construction. An important part of Area C has been allocated for the benefit of Israeli settlements or the Israeli military at the expense of Palestinian communities. Just this month 35 people, one third of them children, were displaced following forcible transfer actions.</p>, <p eid="para_409"> At what stage does the European Union or the United Nations stop expressing its concerns? What logical action can we take? If we have invested so much time, money and resources in assisting these people, at what stage do we shout "Stop"?</p>]
[<p eid="para_411">I welcome the Minister's response in proactively seeking compensation through the European Union. Israeli civil administration data reveal that only 1.5% of requests for building permits submitted by Palestinians in Area C between 2010 and 2014 were approved, and none were approved in 2015. Perhaps the European Union and by extension Ireland, through the good offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, can continue to press that issue with the Israeli authorities.</p>]
