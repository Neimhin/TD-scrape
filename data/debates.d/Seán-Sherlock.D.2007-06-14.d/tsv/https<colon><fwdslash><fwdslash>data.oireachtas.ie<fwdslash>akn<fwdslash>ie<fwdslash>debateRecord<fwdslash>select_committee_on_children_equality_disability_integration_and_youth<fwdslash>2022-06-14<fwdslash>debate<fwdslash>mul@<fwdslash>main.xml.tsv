[<p eid="para_79">I move amendment No. 3:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_80">In page 6, after line 34, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_81">“(2) A court shall construe this Act in a manner that gives effect to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities done at New York on 13 December 2006, and for this purpose the court shall have regard to the provisions of the Convention, including its preamble.”.</p>, <p eid="para_82">I welcome the Minister. This is a complex Bill and, to be fair to him, there is an honest attempt to promulgate legislation for what is a complex area.</p>, <p eid="para_83"> In this amendment, I wish to ensure that the language around the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which was concluded in 2006, is firmly embedded in the principal Act. Now that we have ratified the convention, I seek to embed an explicit requirement for courts to interpret the Act in a manner that gives effect to the convention, thereby strengthening the potential for it to be interpreted in a manner compatible with the human rights obligations under that convention.</p>]
[<p eid="para_85">I was speaking specifically to my amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_98">I take it from the Minister that he is not minded to accept my amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">On that basis, I seek leave to withdraw my amendment and submit it again on Report Stage. My rationale for proposing it is that the opening line in the Bill's explanatory memorandum reads: "The Bill gives further effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)." I would have thought that it was entirely appropriate for us to give effect to that in an explicit way so as to ensure that the courts "shall construe this Act" in a manner that gives effect to the UNCRPD.</p>, <p eid="para_101"> Human rights law is constantly evolving. By adding the amendment, there would be recognition of what was best practice within the field and a reaffirmation of Ireland's commitment to refining and interpreting the law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations. While the Minister and I will not depart from the necessity of ensuring that we promulgate in a way that is consistent with our human rights obligations, I remain hopeful that he will revert to this matter on Report Stage. If he is determined not to accept the amendment, is there a wording that the Government side could come up with for a specific provision in the legislation to ensure that the courts "shall construe this Act" in a manner that gives effect to the UNCRPD? It is important to bolt this provision into the legislation in a way that it has not been heretofore.</p>]
[<p eid="para_105">I hold to my position of withdrawing the amendment. I want to think about what the Minister has said regarding his interventions in respect of the amendment. I would like to return to it on Report Stage. I want to tease it out a little more in my mind.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I will withdraw it but I formally seek leave to resubmit it on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_171">I move amendment No. 11:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_172">In page 20, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_173">"(13) (a) Subject to paragraph (b), nothing in this section shall operate to prohibit bona fide representatives of the Press and researchers from attending proceedings to which this section relates.</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_174">(b) Where the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so—</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_175">(i) in order to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate,</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_176">(ii) by reason of the nature or circumstances of the case, or</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_177">(iii) as it is otherwise necessary in the interests of justice,</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_178">the court may, on its own motion, or on application to it by a party to the proceedings by order—</p>, <p class="indent_5" eid="para_179">(I) exclude, or otherwise restrict the attendance of, bona fide representatives of the Press and researchers from the court during the hearing or particular parts of it, or</p>, <p class="indent_5" eid="para_180">(II) prohibit or restrict the publication or broadcasting of any evidence given or referred to during the proceedings or any part of such evidence, and any such order may, with regard to any restriction, contain such conditions as the court considers appropriate.</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_181">(c) In determining whether or not to make an order under paragraph (b), a court shall have regard to the desirability of promoting public confidence in the administration of justice and to any other matter that appears to it to be relevant and shall, in particular, have regard to the will and preferences of the person to whom the proceedings relate.".</p>, <p eid="para_182">A clear and consistent approach is required regarding cases which are held "otherwise" than in public, which both ensures the dignity and privacy of the individual and ensures transparency and promotion of the public's understanding of this new law. While it is vital to ensure the will, preferences and privacy of individuals are respected, it is also crucial that the public is aware of how this monumental change to Ireland's capacity laws is operating in practice.</p>, <p eid="para_183"> This amendment allows for judicial discretion and draws on existing legislation to ensure representatives of bona fide press, researchers and legal professionals can still attend and report on cases, subject to reasonable restrictions. The language of the amendment mirrors that which enabled Carol Coulter and her team on the childcare law reporting project to attend and report anonymously on cases regarding child protection in the Family Courts, a project which has been widely praised by the Judiciary and legal practitioners, ourselves in these two Houses as well as social services, for increasing transparency of judicial decision making. We could call it the Carol Coulter amendment. We would all agree that her work and that of her team has been phenomenal.</p>, <p eid="para_184">I suggest setting up a similar type of infrastructure around this Bill, especially for academic researchers. I am mindful of academic researchers in all of this. Such access is important in order that we can generate research papers around this and generate best practice into the future. That is the justification for the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_189">I am happy to withdraw this amendment and come back to this matter on Report Stage, in anticipation of the Minister's reply. I accept the argument made by the Minister in respect of press reportage of the issue and the sensitivities therein.</p>]
[<p eid="para_227">I am out of practice procedurally. What is the strict rule with regard to amendments that are ruled out of order where one has received correspondence from the committee Chair but one wishes to push back on that correspondence?</p>, <p eid="para_228">I am not trying to put the Chair on the spot but one of my own amendments, No. 24, was ruled out of order on the grounds that it would impose a charge on the Revenue. I accept that but what if we wanted to speak more broadly in the hope that the Minister would respond to the content of an amendment? I accept that amendment No. 18 has been ruled out of order but I would love the Minister to engage on the issue inherent in the amendment. </p>]
[<p eid="para_230">Thank you Chair. I accept that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_243">I move amendment No. 22:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_244">In page 57, to delete lines 23 to 28 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_245">“(5) Where a temporary prohibition order is made, the Director shall, as soon as is practicable, serve a copy of the order and of the affidavit referred to in subsection (2) on—</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_246">(a) the decision-making assistant and relevant person concerned,(b) the co-decision-maker and relevant person concerned,(c) the decision-making representative concerned, or(d) the attorney concerned, </p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_247">and on any other persons identified by the Director and approved by the court.” .</p>, <p eid="para_248">The rationale for this amendment is to ensure that the order and affidavit are not only served on the decision supporters but also on the relevant person to whom the matter relates. This is essential to ensure the relevant person's right to know about matters concerning them is respected. The relevant person is ultimately the person who is most impacted by such an order and has a right to the information contained in the director's affidavit, which has given rise to the temporary prohibition order, as well as to be informed personally of the order made by the court.</p>, <p eid="para_249"> I see that the Minister is scratching his beard. He is thinking about it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_251">I am trying to bolt on an amendment here that gives an absolute right because I am fearful, notwithstanding the fact that the director and the staff of the DSS will be beyond reproach, of a systems failure. I ask the Minister to take a look at this before Report Stage and consider providing a more firm underpinning of the relevant person's right to know.</p>]
[<p eid="para_253">I appreciate the Minister's response. It would be great if it could be teased out before Report Stage. I will withdraw my amendment, with leave to resubmit. If the Minister comes up with a better wording, I will be very happy to accept that on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_279">I move amendment No. 28:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_280">In page 62, line 4, after "<b>146.</b>" to insert "(1)".</p>, <p eid="para_281">Those who campaigned for this legislation argued specifically that a comprehensive review clause was necessary to ensure it would remain under ongoing review at regular intervals, given the pace of change in this area globally and advances in practice. This amendment would ensure the legislation is reviewed regularly and can be amended in light of the fast-paced rate of worldwide legislative change on legal capacity law. The amendment also clarifies the central role disabled people and the organisations led and governed by them should play in every review of the legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_291">I will withdraw my amendments with leave to resubmit them. I have an impression that when we legislate, we create obligations on institutions and agencies like IHREC. My concern is that we have another piece of legislation here and the Minister is saying IHREC will have a key role in monitoring the working of that legislation. What we do not have sight of is whether the Decision Support Service or IHREC will see a comparative increase in resources to enable it to carry out the work. We all acknowledge it is an increasing workload. We need to receive some comfort that the Minister, in his engagement with IHREC in respect of this legislation and the legislation that is coming down the track, would give some signal of additional capacity by way of whole-time equivalents for those organisations to meet their increasing demands in terms of monitoring legislation. I would welcome some favourable comment from the Minister in that regard if he is in a position to give that now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_294">I move amendment No. 29:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_295">In page 62, line 7, after “operation” to insert “and every 5 years thereafter”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_304">I move amendment No. 33:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_305">In page 62, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_306">“(2) A review under subsection (1) shall include consultation with, and the active involvement of, persons with disabilities through their representative organisations and shall examine the operation, interpretation and accessibility of this Act and make such recommendations for its reform or the reform of its administration as appear appropriate.”.”.</p>, <p eid="para_307">I will withdraw the amendment and seek leave to resubmit it on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_308">Before we move to the amendments, I seek clarity in regard to section 82 in the context of the Juries Act. My understanding is that section 82 amends the First Schedule of the Juries Act by inserting what is clearly, in our interpretation, a mistaken provision that a person is ineligible to serve as a juror if he or she does not, in the opinion of the court, have sufficient mental or intellectual “incapacity”. That is the wording that is there, although it may have been corrected in the intervening period. I wonder should we be substituting “capacity” for “incapacity”.</p>, <p eid="para_309">The issue may have been spotted by the Minister and his team already; I am just putting it on the record.</p>]
[<p eid="para_332">Can I speak to that amendment?</p>]
[<p eid="para_334">Yes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_336">I move amendment No. 37:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_337">"In page 65, line 2, after “subsection (8)” to insert the following: </p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_338">“and, in so doing, to have particular regard to its obligations under Articles 4(3) and 33(3) of the Convention”."</p>]
