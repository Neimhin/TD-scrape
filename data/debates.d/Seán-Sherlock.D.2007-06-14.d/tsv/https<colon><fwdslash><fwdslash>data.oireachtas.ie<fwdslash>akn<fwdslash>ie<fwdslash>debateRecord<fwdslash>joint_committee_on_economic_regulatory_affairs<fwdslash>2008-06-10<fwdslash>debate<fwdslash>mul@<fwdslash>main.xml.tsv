SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Mr. Burgess for his presentation.  I shall be brief and to the point.Arising from this document, which is fairly self-evident, from what he says, is there scope for looking at the role of the consumer panel to intervene with the Financial Regulator or to intervene publicly in forums other than this one to highlight some of the issues Mr. Burgess talks about?  It seems that there is a culture within banking, which has always been secretive, for commercial and other cultural reasons.  That type of culture seems to pervade the remit of the Financial Regulator.  Is there scope for increasing the powers of the consumer panel to bring the Financial Regulator to book on some of the issues Mr. Burgess has outlined?  The role of the consumer panel as it is constituted at present, while it has a remit on committees such as this, is perhaps very limited in its scope and may need to be expanded somewhat.In terms of Mr. Burgess's presentation vis-à-vis the credit union movement, notwithstanding the regulator’s intervention on the loss of €40 million, I have often thought that this sector was underperforming in terms of its potential.  Given the amount of money on deposit within the credit union movement — I do not know the exact sum — and its purchasing power, is there scope to expand its operations in terms of credit facilities and increased banking facilities?  The credit union as it is constituted is owned by its membership.  Is there a role for the consumer panel?  While that question may be a little off the point, Mr. Burgess referred to the credit union movement.  From a consumer perspective, is there increased scope for the credit union movement to perhaps increase or widen its remit from a credit or financial institution perspective?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will return to this point after Mr. Burgess has responded to Deputy Kirk's questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Mr. Burgess mentioned the paragraph on selling investment products to the elderly.  There seems to be a glaring deficiency.  According to the 2006 report, the ombudsman referred the issue of misselling to the elderly to the regulator who, following a relevant "Prime Time" programme in 2008, reported that there was no information to verify a widespread problem.  Besides the ombudsman's report, the "Prime Time" programme showed clear evidence.  Is it a question of resources?  Is the Financial Regulator so consumed by the prudential rules governing banking and financial institutions that the consumer element of its operations is not as prioritised as it should be?  I want Mr. Burgess's opinion, not to put words in his mouth.The majority of people have faith in financial institutions, given that they have bank accounts, mortgages and so on.  Due to an inherent faith in the system, the bulk of transactions are carried out without question.  However, people do not visit their bank branches and ask difficult questions about banks' functions.  Speaking for myself, there is a certain degree of ignorance born of an inherent trust.  Were more consumers to begin questioning at ground level the nature of the transactions, charging mechanisms, etc., there would be a different culture that would not give rise to the points being addressed by Mr. Burgess or programmes such as "Prime Time".
