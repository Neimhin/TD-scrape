[<p eid="para_55">I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today.  I am very pleased to be here to discuss my role as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  I am accompanied by Mr. Michael Davitt, assistant principal officer, Mr. Martin Shanagher, assistant secretary, Ms Anne Forde, principal officer, and Ms Helen Nugent,  Ms Gráinne O'Carroll, Ms Patricia Timmins and Ms Anne O'Mahony.</p>, <p eid="para_56">Members of this committee will be aware that the Government has set job creation and retention as one of its key priorities in the programme for Government.  In this context, the concept of supporting enterprise and promoting business innovation goes to the heart of what we are doing as a Government.  We will seek, and we will succeed, in our efforts to provide a better future for our young people, for our society and for Irish business by creating a climate in which entrepreneurs can do business, business can flourish and trade can grow.  Our objective in Government is clear. We are encouraging the renewal of a sustainable economy by putting in place supportive enterprise policies and investments aligned to deliver a return of sustainable jobs.  A key element of these policies is the research and innovation initiative.  It is a central priority at the core of my Department's efforts and that of the enterprise State agencies under the auspices of my Department.</p>, <p eid="para_57">Our exports are performing well and leading recovery.  In June 2011, exports were up 5.6% to €8.343 billion on June 2010.  The €4 billion trade surplus in June was the highest ever.  This feeds through to the domestic economy as exporting companies grow and increase their trade with suppliers.  Investment in science, technology and innovation is directly linked to growth in sales and exports.  From 2000 to 2009, exports from El and IDA firms that were research and development performers grew from €44 billion to €87 billion while exports from non-performers fell from €48 billion to €39 billion.  Research and development and innovation has evolved to become a key driver of business success.</p>, <p eid="para_58">I would like to outline the areas of focus within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  They are supporting the agenda for research, development and innovation and ensuring it is a strong driver of growth; prioritising public investment in research, development and innovation so we obtain the greatest possible return on our investment in terms of jobs, new intellectual property and technologies; winning more FDI investment and getting enhanced technologies and ideas rapidly from research to companies that will commercialise them; and ensuring that our education system is lining up the skills and expertise needed for the future.  Our emerging workforce will need skills in science, technology, engineering and maths and these skills must be fostered from the early days of school life.</p>, <p eid="para_59">I strongly welcome the fact that our cost base is improving to enhance our competitiveness but cost reduction is only part of the answer.  If we are to compete and be successful in the challenging and competitive trade environment in which we operate, Ireland must become both a high productivity and high innovation economy.  We must have top-class research and innovation and embed it in our enterprise because this is a sure-fire way for Irish companies to acquire a competitive advantage in national and international trade.</p>, <p eid="para_60">As a country, we have trebled the level of investment in research and development.  We strongly support enterprises to do more research and development.  We have invested in human capital, in top quality researchers and third and fourth level education.  We have now got excellent physical research infrastructure in place and the structures to commercialise research.  This public investment has accelerated the creation and application of new knowledge and technologies, has contributed significantly to the competitiveness of indigenous enterprise and has played a large part in attracting increases in foreign direct investment.</p>, <p eid="para_61">The three enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, are working together in a coherent and complementary way under the direction of my Department to support the development of an innovative and vibrant enterprise sector.  I will briefly touch on the role being played by a number of agencies in implementing and underpinning Government policies in this area.</p>, <p eid="para_62">Through Enterprise Ireland we are working to enhance the capacity of indigenous enterprise to develop new products and services, we are building research development and innovation capacity within companies to create competitive advantage, we are providing support to commercialise research ideas and we are developing and fostering links with the third-level research base.</p>, <p eid="para_63">Enterprise Ireland's goal is to grow the capacity of Irish companies so that both domestic activity and exports can expand, create wealth and increase jobs.  Enterprise Ireland client companies exported €14 billion in 2010, which was a 10% increase on 2009.  New export sales totalled a record €1,945 million, with growth in all major sectors.  During 2010, El approved funding to 1,070 companies, supported 80 new innovative start-up enterprises, and financial support was approved for significant research and development projects, that is a grant in excess of €100,000, for 860 client companies.  In 2010, 8,193 new jobs were created in El supported companies, bringing the total number employed in these companies to 137,000.</p>, <p eid="para_64">With the goal of getting existing companies involved in research and innovation and of developing new innovative companies, a number of strategic programmes are offered by Enterprise Ireland.  The high potential start-up scheme provides supports and funds for start-up companies and entrepreneurs through investment in equity.  The target is to increase the number of new companies created to 100 per annum by 2013.  The initiative to transform research and development activity in enterprise fosters and supports the growth of research and development capabilities needed by an enterprise to grow, develop and trade.  Through industry collaboration programmes, companies are linked with third level researchers and get them working together for the benefit of industry.  The commercialisation of a research programme provides funds to bring an already developed research idea to a point where it can be transferred to the market place.</p>, <p eid="para_65">Through the IDA we are continuing to attract high quality foreign direct investment projects to Ireland and embed existing FDI companies in the Irish economy.  Half the FDI wins are now research and innovation projects; in 2010 there were 37 investments, worth around €500 million.  The IDA is focused on winning new investments, in particular in sectors such as life sciences, including pharma, biopharma and medical devices, ICT and financial services.</p>, <p eid="para_66">Foreign direct investment has been hugely important for the Irish economy and job creation over the last 30 years.  The IDA supported FDI sector alone accounts for around 240,000 jobs in the economy or 13% of the labour force.  Research, development and innovation plays its strategic role as part of Ireland's FDI landscape embedding existing employment and setting the groundwork for increased future employment.  In overall terms, IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies directly accounted for the employment of approximately 300,000 people in the Irish economy.  These companies also supported an estimated additional 300,000 indirect jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_67">Through Science Foundation Ireland we are continuing to foster top-class research and develop and make Ireland into an attractive option for researchers and firms seeking to conduct world-class scientific research.  In ten years, Ireland has moved from Third World status into the world's top 20 countries based on quality of research output.  Science Foundation Ireland activities are undertaken because the long-term competitiveness of enterprise can only be successfully built upon a base of top-class national research.</p>, <p eid="para_68">Much of the focus of SFI is directed to strengthen connections between researchers and industry.  This is achieved through the centres for science, engineering and technology - CSETs - and strategic research clusters - SRCs.  SFI currently supports nine CSETs and 19 SRCs and currently supports over 2,500 research positions directly.  CSETs and SRCs help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies, and grow partnerships with industry that will make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy.</p>, <p eid="para_69">A substantial impact of the SFI investment is in attracting new foreign direct investment, previously beyond Ireland's reach.  Importantly, this also underpins existing jobs.  SFI researchers now interact with 534 companies, the majority of whom are IDA and Enterprise Ireland clients based in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_70">Although not within my brief as Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I want to speak briefly about the role of county and city enterprise boards in supporting small enterprises.  A network of 35 local offices are the primary initial contact point for business start-ups in Ireland.  The micro-enterprise support programme assists business start-ups at local level. Exchequer funding of €27 million was provided for the CEB network at the start of 2011 and an extra €3.1 million was recently provided to fund further job creation projects, a necessary investment in the current economic situation.  A number of other areas of activity such as the programme for research in third level institutions and the work to enhance maths and science literacy have an important bearing on the future for the enterprise sector, for which I have responsibility.</p>, <p eid="para_71">PRTLI is an enabling investment, putting in place the bedrock of national research capacity in the higher education sector.  This includes top-class research infrastructure, namely, buildings, laboratories and cutting edge equipment, including national shared facilities and structured PhD programmes.  It is about providing appropriate top-class facilities for Ireland's research community while also providing training and education opportunities for our next generation of scientists.  It will significantly contribute to the Government's goal of developing the capacity and capability of the higher education institutions to carry out high quality research across various fields of strategic national importance.  The €359 million investment under PRTLI will stimulate our economy and is an investment in the future.</p>, <p eid="para_72">On science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, I am working in a cross-departmental role with the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to enhance science and maths literacy and to up-skill our emerging workforce for the skills needs of the future.  We must ensure that graduates in science, technology, engineering and maths have the relevant skills that are applicable in the current employment market.  While the latest OECD data shows that, on average, the number of science graduates in Ireland is higher than other countries, there is need for continued focus.  A targeted approach is being taken to bridge the short-term skills gap in ICT graduates identified by the expert group on future skills needs.  We will also address the longer-term pipeline issues.  The emerging action plan on ICT will be complemented by initiatives to improve the mathematical proficiency of new entrants to higher education, as well as by measures to ensure that the higher education sector responds to the changing skills needs of industry.  The promotion of science awareness and careers in science is particularly important if there is to be a steady pipeline of young people equipped to sustain a true knowledge economy.</p>, <p eid="para_73">The Discover Science and Engineering, DSE, programme, an initiative of my Department and Forfás, has undertaken two key initiatives as part of the ongoing campaign to encourage young people to develop an interest in maths and in careers where a high level of competence in maths is required.  A major reform in the teaching of maths at primary and post-primary school, Project Maths, is also under way, involving a major curriculum revision, a different approach in the examinations papers and a nationwide programme of education for existing mathematics teachers.  From summer 2012, bonus points will be awarded to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in leaving certificate maths in respect of entry to higher education institutes.  In addition, the programme for Government contains commitments to reform maths and science teaching at second level, to make science a compulsory junior certificate subject by 2014 and to prioritise professional development for maths and science teachers.</p>, <p eid="para_74">The Government is committed to ensuring that we get the maximum return on public investment in science, technology and innovation.  My Department, together with Forfás, is leading a research prioritisationinitiative to identify areas of opportunity with the greatest potential to deliver economic return, with a view to the Government prioritising the public investment in science, technology and innovation to support the real opportunities there.  This is chaired by Dr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.  Another planned change is the extension of the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, to enable it to bring the research it funds closer to market.  Work is also well under way on the development of an intellectual property protocol, the objective of which is to establish clear, straightforward ground rules around ownership of and access to all State supported IP, with a view to supporting commercial exploitation of the results of publicly funded research.  Clarity and certainty with regard to IP can be another plus in choosing Ireland as a place to do business.</p>, <p eid="para_75">I thank the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation this morning.  I assure the committee that the Government is taking a strategic approach to the science, technology and innovation field.  I welcome all opportunities to engage with this committee or individuals of it on any aspect of this field.  I would argue that it is largely an apolitical space and, as such, the views of all Senators and Deputies will be vital.  The more we engage with committees and individual Members, the more proficient we will be in terms of the roll-out of policies in this area.  The Government is open to engage with Members on identified needs in this regard.  I thank the committee for its time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">Science Foundation Ireland funds basic research.  We need to move it into a more applied space.  The key aim is to increase market outputs.  The research prioritisation exercise is focused on ensuring that research can move into a commercialisation space and, therefore, create necessary spin-outs and embed further the collaboration between industry and academia.  In extending the remit of SFI into a more applied space we can facilitate that process.  That is key.  The legislation in that regard is currently being drawn up.  It is vital that we acknowledge the collaboration between SFI and industry.  Approximately 3,000 researchers are funded and there are 530 plus collaborations with industry or individual companies.  We are talking about supporting 90,000 plus jobs in this field.</p>, <p eid="para_83">We need to ensure Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is in a space in which it is closer to industry but maintaining its core principle of having the best researchers in the field.  That is where the funding of basic research comes into play.</p>, <p eid="para_84">The rate of job losses is being stemmed.  While no spin can be put on the fact that in 2009 there were 18,000 net jobs lost compared to only 5,300 net new jobs, the rate of losses is being stemmed now, which is vital in Enterprise Ireland's view.  In 2010, there were 80 new HPSU, high potential start-up, companies.  The HPSUs have funded about €18.7 million in equity grants and €21 million in follow-up investment.  In the first six months of 2011, some 41 HPSU companies were supported which will provide more than 750 jobs in the next three years.</p>, <p eid="para_85">Patent applications in 2005 came to 83 while in 2010 they came to 101.  In 2008 and 2009 they came to 2002 and 144 respectively.  Licensing arrangements between 2005 and 2010 went from 12 to 93.  More licensing of innovations is good for industry and academia.  I accept the peak in 2008 has reduced but it has gone up on average since 2005.</p>, <p eid="para_86">SFI capital grants increased from €150 million in 2010 to €160.8 million in 2011.</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">The changes that will take place in the county enterprise board structure will bring them more in line with the one-stop shop model.  This will also address some of the concerns regarding enterprise support at local level.  We all agree there needs to be a more streamlined approach.  I absolutely agree with the point made on fragmentation.</p>, <p eid="para_92">With regard to job creation in science, technology and innovation I would argue there is highly evolved interaction between academia and industry.  The number of collaborations is very high.  It is highly evolved in the sense that Enterprise Ireland is very close to the ground and very knowledgeable on what companies' needs are with regard to science, technology and innovation because they interface with them on a daily basis.  I think I can stand over this because I have responsibility for science, technology and innovation.</p>, <p eid="para_93">Extending the remit of SFI to allow it into the applied space would leverage more in terms of economic outputs.  However, a challenge still exists.  We could do more work with the technology transfer offices in each institution to try to leverage more.  The research prioritisation exercise will create thematic approaches on where research funding will go, so EI, SFI and the IDA will be locked into a space with the Government to allow as much as possible to be extracted.  It would allow the potential to be exploited commercially to create more jobs in the field.</p>, <p eid="para_94">It is not a case of resting on our laurels.  Successive Governments have realised the potential of science, technology and innovation and more and more related foreign direct investment jobs are embedded in Ireland by virtue of the research and development component.  We cannot overlook this either.</p>, <p eid="para_95">I take the point made by Deputy Tóibín on streamlining.  He asked for figures on the budget allocation for county enterprise boards, CEBs.  Exchequer funding for the CEB network at the beginning of 2011 was €27.2 million of which €15 million was made available for capital expenditure.  In the past two weeks, the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, announced funding of €3.1 million for the CEBs for further job creation projects in the remaining months of 2011.  I have not seen the metrics on how this has been spent so far or what is the return on the investment in terms of job creation.  It has yet to be assessed as far as I am aware.</p>, <p eid="para_96">One must be careful with regard to high potential start-ups.  I imagine the Deputy has a figure in mind, and he mentioned 100 in Dublin alone.  If one seeks to achieve this, one cannot be afraid of failure.  By this I mean in the US, which has a highly-evolved venture capital structure, there are fewer hang-ups about failure.  However, if the State will fund an exponentially larger number of high potential start-ups using taxpayers' money then the State cannot be afraid of these companies failing.  There is a good chance a certain proportion of high potential start-ups will fail.</p>, <p eid="para_97">The balance we have struck is correct.  I will hear the Deputy's views on it and I have an open mind.  If we try to hit these targets we will be doing fairly well.  We must be mindful that we are funding companies in the sector using taxpayers' money and we must be careful about how we expend these resources.  There must be checks and balances to ensure the risk is mitigated.</p>, <p eid="para_98">Much work is being done with regard to InterTradeIreland and the North-South link.  The trading and investing in a smart economy strategy was launched in September and it uses all of our diplomatic resources to maximise support for Irish businesses in key markets.  The focus is on promoting team Ireland.  The Deputy is aware of the good work done by the Government throughout the island with regard to InterTradeIreland.  I do not have statistics with me on this work but I can come back to the Deputy with the information.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">I take the point.  Another point to make on funding in the science, technology and innovation framework is that there is much collaboration on the framework 7 funding model between North and South.  Enterprise Ireland's innovation vouchers also work on a North-South basis.  I am happy to speak to the Deputy on the point he has made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_102">I am not entirely sure I accept Enterprise Ireland is demand-led.  Perhaps more could be done with regard to SMEs but the level of engagement between Enterprise Ireland and the multinational sector which supports more than 100,000 jobs is a highly-evolved model and constantly pushes out.  If members have not already done so I encourage them to visit any of the Enterprise Ireland partially-funded centres throughout the State which are involved in frontier research with industry.  They are supported by the State agencies in a very highly-evolved model.  It puts us in the top 20 in some of the metrics in specific areas of research.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">The point can be fleshed out when Enterprise Ireland comes before the committee.  My experience as a Minister of State with regard to working with Enterprise Ireland on science, technology and innovation is that there is no complacency.  It constantly listens to industry on its needs.  If one visits institutes such as the Tyndall Institute in Cork; the Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices, CRANN; Athlone Institute of Technology; or Institute of Technology, Sligo one will see a highly-evolved model of engagement on the needs of industry by the State agencies.  We should not underestimate this.  Perhaps an opportunity will be provided to flesh it out in greater detail.</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">I am not aware of international comparators in this area.  The measurement is the number of jobs supported and the top tens and top 20s we hit in specific fields of research.  Eight of the top ten pharmaceutical companies are based in Ireland.</p>]
[<p eid="para_112">I do not have an answer but I will come back to the Deputy.</p>]
[<p eid="para_120">To reply to Deputy Conaghan's question, the city of science programme will be a vital showcase for Ireland.  It will happen in July 2012 and we are expecting between 5,000 and 7,000 delegates.  The Government will provide €2.9 million towards the cost of the programme which will cost approximately €6 million.  They key focus will be on showcasing Ireland's talents in this field to boost our standing internationally.  The multiplier effect of up to 7,000 delegates returning to their respective countries will be great.  Our key goal is to promote the country in this global setting.  The programme will have the knock-on effect of promoting careers in science and greater engagement by students and parents because of the publicity that will be generated.  We are, therefore, taking the event seriously.  In the recent past people have made a joke about Ireland trying to restore its international reputation, but the Government takes this agenda seriously, of which this programme is part.  If we take the opportunity to showcase the best and the brightest, we will get a return on our investment in terms of reputational enhancement.  That is one part of the process.</p>, <p eid="para_121">With regard to schools, Project Maths is a vital component at second level.  The ship has sailed and the programme will be rolled out in every school.  We believe strongly that because of how it is taught, it will have a positive effect downstream on examination results.  The provision of bonus points next year should result in a marked change in the results obtained.  The aim is to ensure students think more laterally about the everyday use of maths.  We want to deconstruct a language where parents say they were never any good at maths and this is reinforced in their children.  If we can do this, there will be a positive effect downstream, but we have to be mindful of the need to ensure that while education is a priority, there is a balance between this and the graduates we produce.  The intention should not only be to churn out engineers in order that they can interface with companies but also to get students to think laterally in solving problems, which is the key component.</p>, <p eid="para_122">Within the innovation and maths space we have young social innovators.  I attended an event in my home town of Mallow which was attended by more than 2,000 parents and primary schoolchildren who interacted with providers in the science and maths space.  A great deal of work is being done by the national centre of excellence in the University of Limerick, Calmast and the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork.  The aim of these initiatives is to make STEM subjects more attractive to students at a younger age.  We are having success in this regard, but the challenge will be to roll out these projects in primary schools.</p>, <p eid="para_123">The fundamental question is whether it is possible to teach entrepreneurship.  Is it something that is innate or can it be learned?  That is a matter on which I would defer to Senator Quinn.  There are now more flexible models in schools, particularly in transition year.  The YSI model is very good and we have seen a major proliferation of companies being set up at schools level.  It seems to be more embedded, but if we need to do more I would like to hear the Senator's views on that.  Where do we go and are we on the right track?  I believe we are with Project Maths.  We need to do more in the junior cycle, but the Department is doing considerable work in that and the primary sector is the key.  We will have continuing professional development of teachers, especially for teachers who are out of field.  I may have used the term unqualified teachers before - I openly admit that was the wrong choice of phrasing.  We need to look at out-of-field teachers who are teaching maths and invest money - which will happen - in upskilling those teachers and providing CPD.  It all depends on the engagement of the teachers and schools, and I hope they will engage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">We also have the excellent discover science and engineering programme run by Forfás, which does much outreach with individual schools.  Peter Brabazon there does great work in interacting with schools.</p>, <p eid="para_126">I have only just begun to engage with the issue of fear of failure.  It is worn like a badge of honour by Americans engaging with VCs.  It is almost as if one must fail in order to ultimately succeed.  We should inculcate that culture that one is allowed to fail once and the State agencies will support such a person who wants to come back into the system again.</p>]
[<p eid="para_132">The Department set up an ICT steering group in 2010.  That was a stakeholder forum to address the issues Deputy Lyons and Senator Clune raised.  We need to start with the dotcom bubble that burst, which led to a decrease in the points requirements for science and ICT-related courses.  As demand for those courses has now increased, some of that demand will be fulfilled, albeit within the next three to four years.  The question is what we should do in the intervening period to fill the 2,500 vacancies Deputy Lyons mentioned.  The Department will shortly roll out a facility to facilitate bridging of the skills gap for industry.  That will facilitate engineers or others who want to upskill and transfer into the industry.</p>, <p eid="para_133">These issues are being tackled, but the fundamental issue is one of getting kids to engage in programming languages.  They know how to play games and are early adopters of technology.  I have witnessed this with children as young as two years of age.  How do we get them into a space in which they begin to engage in creating games and the knowledge base to see what occurs behind the screen?  This is where we want to go.  Work is being done in this regard, but industry, including Internet service providers, has a greater role to play.  A further engagement with the Irish Internet Association may be the way to go.</p>, <p eid="para_134">An ICT action plan is in place.  Its purpose is to engage with the questions being posed by Deputy Lyons and Senator Clune.</p>]
[<p eid="para_136">We can make it available.  DSE and others are trying to engage kids in these platforms, but the work is disparate.  We have heard from individuals working with VECs on rolling out specific programmes in, for example, east County Galway, where someone visited schools to teach languages.  How can this be rolled out across the State, given the fact that not every kid will be able to engage?</p>, <p eid="para_137">The key point is we are grappling with the issue.  One must strike a balance between the core educational subjects and other subjects.  I do not want to say "market-focused", but if we want to create the best graduates in the world, that is the space we must enter.  It must start when kids are young.  The action plan's bridging courses will tackle personnel shortages in those sectors in the short term.</p>, <p eid="para_138">I have just been informed by my officials.  They are excellent and we sometimes underestimate them.  By all accounts, the shortage within the ICT sector is a global phenomenon.  We are conscious of this fact and are trying to bridge the gap.</p>, <p eid="para_139">We need to maintain the engagement with technology transfer offices, TTOs.  The structure that is in place is vital.  Their current round of funding is up for renewal and a conversation is under way within the Department as to how the funding process will evolve.  I have met TTOs from individual institutions and one cannot but be impressed by their work.  We need to discuss with them the question of extracting more, but their work is inherently good and they have a strong link with industry.</p>, <p eid="para_140">Discussions are under way on how to extract further IPs and obtain further licensing arrangements, whether we need to be more pragmatic in our approach and whether a conversation on getting more of a return on this publicly funded research is necessary.  The TTOs have a forward-looking viewpoint and I will meet them shortly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_142">Yes.  One must be conscious of the need for TTOs.  If this component is axed, there will be a major gap.</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">It is under review.</p>]
[<p eid="para_146">Pre-service training will be extended.  There will be a two-year higher diploma and a B.Ed of four years.  This is one way of tackling the issue.  I had a good meeting with the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, ASTI, last week.  There seems to be a strong willingness to engage on each of the platforms in question.</p>, <p eid="para_147">According to the National Centre for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching and Learning, NCE-MTSL, which rolls out many continuous professional development, CPD, programmes, there is a strong demand among teachers for CPD in out-of-field subjects.  This is encouraging.  My sense of the situation is that the teaching community wants to upskill and train.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">Deputy McFadden referred to incubator units.  Last Friday, I visited Athlone Institute of Technology, a shining light regionally in how these units should be run.  The Midlands Innovation and Research Centre, MIRC, in the institute is doing fabulous work.</p>, <p eid="para_154">I do not know the statistics on age, but the number of mature students in higher level institutions is increasing year on year.  This is one way of tackling the skills shortage and providing opportunities for people within the age bracket in question.  Through the VEC structures, colleges of further education are doing a great deal of work.  Their age coterie is higher than average.  This is one platform.  The labour market activation programmes deal specifically with people aged over 50 years.  JobBridge provides opportunities for people to obtain skills relevant to sectors other than those in which they worked heretofore.  In fairness to the Department of Social Protection, there is a great deal being done to ensure we get people within that age bracket back into the workforce.</p>, <p eid="para_155">Deputy McFadden is correct that there are people with huge life and work experience who do not necessarily have a qualification.  The Government is actively trying to bring that breadth of experience back into structure.</p>]
[<p eid="para_157">I take on board the Deputy's point.  Springboard is a targeted programme.  On mentoring, I have spoken at length on this issue with Deputy Collins and have taken on board her point about soft skills.  People will say that it is not always money they are looking for when interacting with the State agencies.  Very often, what they need is mentoring.  Enterprise Ireland operates a mentoring programme.  If members have views on that programme-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">It is often perceived that those who provide mentoring are ex-consultants or ex-bank managers.  That is not a criticism of bank managers.  However, we may perhaps need a wider array of advisers in terms of mentoring.</p>, <p eid="para_161">I am happy to take part in deeper engagement with the committee in respect of issues which individual members believe the Government needs to do more.</p>]
[<p eid="para_163">We will also work to that end.  On work permits, I have been told turnaround through the IDA is usually 15-days for people with key skills.  I understand that the Minister for Justice and Equality is also working on ensuring a quick turnaround in respect of visa applications.</p>]
[<p eid="para_165">If there are specific examples, I would like to hear them.</p>]
[<p eid="para_168">Perhaps we should take a closer look at that issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_176">I thank Deputy Fleming for his comments and questions.  I agree with him in respect of the priorities he has outlined.  I hope I have addressed those in the course of the debate.
