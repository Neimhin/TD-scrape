[<p eid="para_41">Has the Data Protection Commission reached the end of the line in its involvement with this legislation? I ask this because if there is to be a data protection impact analysis, presumably the DPC is still in, what I would call, an iterative process in respect of the legislation. I ask Mr. Sunderland for clarity on that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_43">I am trying to think forward to where there might be - I will use the word "dispute", though lightly - a dispute between two parties, the parent and the child. If it reaches the point where there is a dispute, where does the DPC see itself in terms of the existing legislation in respect of dispute resolution and in the context of this legislation when it is passed? In other words, when there are competing parties, as I understand it, the DPC seeks to mediate between them. If a situation arises, however, that is beyond mediation or agreement, where stands the DPC in all of that? I hope that question makes sense. If it does not, tell me straight out.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">This was an issue that was on my mind and I wanted to seek clarity on it. Mr. Sunderland has confirmed what I thought. This is an iterative process and the DPC has yet to fully analyse or process the data protection impact assessment. In light of that, and once that analysis is done, I ask the Chair if there is a possibility of hearing further from the DPC on how this legislation works in the context of its responsibilities? I would welcome a further submission on that. I will leave it at that.</p>]
