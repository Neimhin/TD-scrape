[<p eid="para_39">This series of amendments inserts the words "managed and controlled" into sections of the Bill. The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance.</p>, <p eid="para_40"> The proposed amendments are illegal under EU law and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law of freedom of establishment, a core aspect of EU law. The European Commission closely monitors compliance with this law. The Commission has recently required Ireland to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland. This proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting these amendments.</p>]

There is still some work to be done on that. I ask members for some latitude in terms of the sheer volume of the legislation. I am proceeding in accordance with the protocol that we notify the committee of our intent to introduce amendments on Report Stage.

[<p eid="para_104">To clarify, there is no intention to make substantive changes to the law itself in terms of its qualitative aspect.

[<p eid="para_274">I understand the Deputy's proposal. I am advised that his suggestion is part of the law as it stands and that, therefore, no amendment is required. Under section 18 of the Interpretation Act, a person includes a body corporate. This is why the definition is not explained specifically in this section. It has been upheld in the High Court in Fyffes plc <i>v</i> DCC plc &amp; ors, IEHC 477, and in the Supreme Court in respect of the liquidation of Worldport Ireland Limited in 2008. Therefore, the law is sufficient as it stands and I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_277">The courts effectively agree with the view proffered by the Deputy. The law is sufficient as it stands.</p>]
[<p eid="para_286">Under existing law, directors are required to have regard to the interests of employees. This amendment would change it to a duty to employees. This may mean that members and employees would have a directly enforceable right against directors where they act contrary to their respective interests. This would compromise the fundamental structure of the directors' relationship with the company, which is described to be fiduciary, that is to say it requires directors to prefer the interests of the company over their interests or those of others, even where those others include some members of the company.</p>, <p eid="para_287"> The amendment puts into question the status of the law of oppression, which is the principal protection of minority shareholders under the current law and much of the employment law. Such a vague and general declaration of a duty without any explanation as to how it interacts with existing law would serve to create great uncertainty in company law. This is directly contrary to one of the key objectives of the Bill, which is to clarify directors' duties. The amendment may also breach constitutional property rights.</p>, <p eid="para_288"> Ultimately, bolstering protections for employees should be done using employment law. These provisions only serve to complicate company law and do nothing to protect employees of partnerships and sole traders and public employees. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_294">No.</p>]
[<p eid="para_320">Notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy has been brushing up on his neo-Marxist economic theory - it sounds vaguely familiar from my college days - this question was dealt with comprehensively by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in its 2005 report on directors' compliance statements. If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business. The set-up cost for a business was an estimated €90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at €40,000. A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas. Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties.</p>, <p eid="para_321"> More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement. There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries. The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_324">I beg the Chairman's indulgence. To a certain extent, I understand the motive behind the amendment, but one must factor into the equation a corpus of environmental, health and safety and employment law. The issue of negative or positive externalities does not arise. We must ensure that there is robust legislation. Every citizen is subject to the existing corpus of law and companies are legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.</p>, <p eid="para_325">That is already inherent, thereby rendering the amendment unsupportable in that sense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_335">I am considering introducing an amendment to section 227 on Report Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to provide an exemption for USIT's companies as regulated by 2011 EU regulations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_336">I move amendment No. 60:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_337">In page 243, to delete lines 25 and 26 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_338">"(h) in addition to the duty under <i>section 225</i> (duty to have regard to the interests of its employees in general), have regard to the interests of its members.".</p>]
[<p eid="para_345">The purpose of this amendment is clarificatory in nature. The current text refers to the directors having a duty to have regard to the interests of members in addition to the general duty owed to employees under section 225. However, section 225 does not impose such a duty on directors to their employees. Section 225 provides that the matters to which the directors are to have regard in the performance of their functions shall include the interests of the company's employees in general. I hope that clarifies the matter further for the Deputy.</p>]
[<p eid="para_347">I beg the Chair's indulgence, but can the Deputy please explain that again?</p>]
[<p eid="para_349">We can look at that again on Report Stage for Deputy Calleary.</p>]
[<p eid="para_356">Such documents are already in circulation and are available free from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement's website. The Companies Registration Office already sends these documents to directors of newly formed companies. However, because most companies are formed by company formation's businesses, the documents generally do not get to the directors at all.</p>, <p eid="para_357"> More important in this respect is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10, that is to say, before they receive the paper copy. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment. However, even though this is not a matter for primary legislation, I acknowledge that the idea is a good one. For this reason, I will consider introducing a live link to the relevant ODCE documents so that directors can read and understand their duties online before completing the electronic form when it becomes available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_359">When people sign up as directors they have obligations. As I said earlier, more important in this respect, is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10. Therefore, that obligation is already there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_368">I do not think anybody would disagree with the sentiments expressed. This is not a matter for primary legislation. It could be dealt with through the ODCE and CRO simplifying the language or ensuring that people are made aware in the starkest terms of their obligations in relation to any legal entity of which they become part. That is perhaps all one can do. If somebody decides to become part of a community-voluntary body or legal entity, there is only so much that the State or Government can do to legislate in respect of that decision. One would expect that people when signing up to such bodies are fully aware of their obligations. People have a personal responsibility to find out their obligations. If it is possible to simplify the language around those obligations the matter should be taken up by the ODCE and CRO.</p>]
[<p eid="para_370">Yes.</p>]

[<p eid="para_380">I move amendment No. 63:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_381">In page 276, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_382">

[<p eid="para_389">This is not a logical inclusion in a company's financial statements. Financial statements relate to the company's financial performance and not its tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government were to require businesses to obtain and publish a certificate of tax compliance it would do so in tax law to catch both company and all non-company businesses that also pay taxes. The introduction of this requirement would be entirely without precedent in Europe. I am not, therefore, in favour of accepting the amendment.</p>]

[<p eid="para_402">Since group financial statements relate to a corporate group, the group financial statements of a subsidiary, which is also a parent company, would not give any more information than the group accounts of the company at the top of the corporate group. Therefore deletion of this exemption would benefit no one other than the lawyers and accountants who would have to prepare and file thousands more group financial statements than they do at present.</p>, <p eid="para_403"> Many foreign direct investment companies rely on this exemption to avoid having to prepare intermediate level group accounts that simply replicate a part of their general top level group accounts. The economic benefit of investing in Ireland would be substantially eroded by requiring these companies to prepare many different sets of group accounts. This would also be a departure from established international practice. Most notably this exemption exists in the United Kingdom. This deletion might constitute a breach of articles 7, 8 and 11 of the seventh accounting directive. For those reasons I am not in favour of changing the section.</p>]
[<p eid="para_405">I am not sure I understand the question. This is effectively avoiding a duplication or proliferation of reporting mechanisms. The Deputy seems to seek greater clarity on those companies that are Irish-registered but non-resident companies. Section 301 reads: "Subject to its not having elected to prepare IFRS group financial statements and to <i>subsection (4)</i>, a holding company is exempt from the requirement to prepare group financial statements if the holding company (the “lower holding company”) is itself a subsidiary undertaking and its holding undertaking is not established under the laws of an EEA state and one or other of the following cases applies." It continues to list exemptions and so on. I am trying to get to the nub of the question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_410">I can get the Deputy a more comprehensive answer on the issue. It follows on, in effect, the theme of the other amendments on management and control.

[<p eid="para_473">While this matter has been referred to the company law review group, I will give the Deputy some thoughts on it here. The question effectively pertains to the requirement that an audit give a true and fair view sufficiently robust to ensure accurate accounting. That is the aspect.</p>]
[<p eid="para_475">Fair enough. As EU law requires that statutory audits give a true and fair view, this already is inherent within EU law. While I will not go into the particulars of the directive, Article 35 states "an audit opinion, which shall be either unqualified, qualified or an adverse opinion and shall state clearly the opinion of the statutory auditor ... as to whether the annual financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework". Thus, any change to the current phrasing in section 337 could contravene EU law. On the question of the revised audit and begging the committee's indulgence, I propose to revert to it on Report Stage with a fuller response.</p>]

[<p eid="para_604">I move amendment No. 92:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_605">In page 546, to delete lines 13 to 28 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_606">“(ii) each tax assessable on, in relation to, or by the company under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the period, ending on or before the relevant date, for which the tax concerned is due and payable, but limited to—</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_607">(I) if there is one such tax, the amount in respect of the period of 12 months next ended on or before that date, or</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_608">(II) if there is more than one such tax, the aggregate of the amounts in respect of the respective periods of 12 months next ended on or before that date, </p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_609">for which the foregoing tax or taxes is or are due and payable;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_610">(iii) any amount due at the relevant date in respect of sums for which an employer is liable under Part 18D or Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and regulations thereunder to deduct from emoluments to which that Part or Chapter applies paid by that employer during the period of 12 months next ended on or before the relevant date reduced by any amount which that employer was under that Part or Chapter and regulations thereunder liable to repay during that period, with the addition of interest payable under section 991 of that Act;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_611">(iv) any tax and interest for which the company is liable under the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 in relation to taxable periods which shall have ended within the period of 12 months next ended before the relevant date;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_612">(v) any local property tax that the company is liable to remit to the Revenue Commissioners under section 74 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 during the period of 12 months next ended before the relevant date and any interest payable in relation to that tax under section 149 of that Act;</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_613">(vi) an amount of local property tax payable, under section 16 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, by the company at the relevant date to the extent that such tax is payable in respect of any one liability date (within the meaning of section 2 of that Act) falling before the relevant date and any interest payable in relation to that tax under section 149 of that Act;”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_615">The purpose of the amendment is to include in preferential payments a number of new taxes. It also accommodates the increasing reliance on self-assessment and tax law by changing "assessed taxes" to "assessable taxes". While this amendment makes small changes to the substance of the law it does not represent a change in policy. It simply updates the Bill where it no longer represents current practice in tax law.</p>]
[<p eid="para_617">"Assessed" is past tense; "assessable" is future tense.</p>]

[<p eid="para_655">It is 18 months.</p>]

[<p eid="para_669">The maximum period is 18 months but it can be done straight away. Let us remember that the provision addresses the "restoration of companies that are struck off and dissolved prior to the enactment of the Bill or during the transition period and to deal with the restoration of companies after the end of the transition period." That lasts for up to 18 months or so but a company could move more quickly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_673">I understand that the committee hearings may have dealt with the matter but perhaps they have not. I ask the Chairman to clarify the matter. The business community sought a certain transition period.</p>]

[<p eid="para_685">The current time limit is six months.</p>]

[<p eid="para_691">It has increased from six to three months.</p>]
[<p eid="para_693">The Bill stated 30 days so one could argue that it will split the difference with Revenue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_695">I know that the Deputy is not being pedantic by posing his question. As he will know, in the case of any Bill consultations take place with a number of stakeholders. There may be a departmental view, there will be a CRO view and there may even be a Revenue view on the matter. The original figure is six months but, following consultation with various stakeholders, it was felt that a figure of three months would be the most expeditious period, rather than 30 days.</p>]
[<p eid="para_697">At the moment it is six months.</p>]
[<p eid="para_699">The Bill suggested 30 days.</p>]
[<p eid="para_707">It is deemed that the District Court is unsuitable for this type of legislation. May I beg the committee's indulgence to give a further explanation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_710">We propose to introduce an amendment to section 762 on Report Stage to insert after paragraph (b) "or by virtue of the Director's functions under the law" in order to acknowledge that the Director of Corporate Enforcement may obtain information or documents in the exercise of his or her functions under the law.</p>]
[<p eid="para_713">To which section is the Deputy referring?</p>]
[<p eid="para_715">Effectively, Part 13 substantially re-enacts without any significant amendment the law regarding the appointment of inspectors to companies and seeks to codify all of the law relating to the investigation of companies. Therefore, the principal changes are the updating of definitions and terminology, facilitating access to the investigation procedure for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, facilitating the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, by empowering the court to make orders in respect of a variety of matters under the Part and, importantly, removing administrative burdens. In that sense, the answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".</p>]
[<p eid="para_716">I move amendment No. 99:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_717">In page 635, line 24, to delete "the CRO Gazette" and substitute "<i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>".</p>]
[<p eid="para_718">I am considering introducing an amendment to section 780 on Report Stage to correct an error and reflect the existing law by deleting the text "have been or are likely to be unlawful" in paragraph (i) and inserting the text "have been, are or are likely to be unlawful".</p>]
[<p eid="para_721">For Deputy Lawlor's purposes, we are being a little bit pedantic.</p>]
[<p eid="para_722">I move amendment No. 100:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_723">In page 645, line 42, to delete "1 month" and substitute "30 days".</p>]
[<p eid="para_724">I am considering introducing an amendment to section 788 on Report Stage to ensure continuity upon the death, retirement or transfer of a person fulfilling the role of designated officer in an investigation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_725">I am considering introducing an amendment to section 793 on Report Stage to include the Revenue Commissioners in the list of competent authorities.</p>]
[<p eid="para_727">Has the Deputy reverted to Part 13?</p>]
[<p eid="para_729">It brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions found in existing legislation, a change that will provide greater transparency. The giving and acceptance of restriction and disqualification undertakings from directors are facilitated, thereby saving costs and court time. One of the Bill's most far-reaching reforms involves the introduction of a new four-tier categorisation of offences. This follows on from a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. It is proposed that, except for the most serious offences, namely, fraudulent trading and market abuse, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme.</p>, <p eid="para_730"> At the higher end of the scale, category 1 offences carry, following conviction on indictment, a term of imprisonment of up to ten years and-or a €500,000 fine.</p>, <p eid="para_731">A further new provision allows a trial court to order a person convicted under the Bill to remedy any breach thereof in respect of which he or she is convicted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_734">One of the questions that has arisen in relation to this section is around prosecutions of breaches of company law and whether the Bill will rectify this issue. The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate. The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed. Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers. Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender. As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted. This must be taken into account in terms of the context of this section.</p>, <p eid="para_735"> Section 798 as drafted under existing law is unchanged.</p>]
[<p eid="para_736">This section is also substantially unchanged from that provided in existing law. However, the court may make an order restraining a company or an officer of the company from removing his or her assets from the State or reducing those assets below a specified amount. This extends to the current law in that it also applies to the company and not, as provided under existing law, only to officers of a company. The circumstances in which an injunction can be granted are now limited to cases where the primary cause of action also arises under this Bill. Alternatively, the cause of action must arise under the provisions of the constitution of the company or relate to the holding of an office of the company.</p>, <p eid="para_737"> Question proposed: "That section 800 stand part of the Bill."</p>]
[<p eid="para_738">This is a new section, the purpose of which is to give guidance on the meaning of the terms "disclosure order" and "share acquisition agreement" under this Part.</p>]
[<p eid="para_739">Again, this is a new section, the purpose of which is to give the court a supplemental power in relation to share acquisition agreements where it has grounds to believe that all the information sought to be obtained by the disclosure order will not be so obtained by a person against whom the order is made and who is a party or former party to a share acquisition agreement. In such circumstances, the court may make an order requiring any other party or former party to the share acquisition agreement to give information to the court in relation to matters affecting the application of section 807 as it applies to the share acquisition agreement. The court may exercise this power on the making of an application for a disclosure order or at any time subsequent to this an application to the court by a person having a financial interest in the company or by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>]

[<p eid="para_744">I will seek an answer from my officials to the Deputy's question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_748">I move amendment No. 102:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_749">In page 670, line 19, to delete "€350,000" and substitute "€500,000".</p>]
[<p eid="para_751">Does the Deputy's question pertain to these amendments?</p>]
[<p eid="para_758">Are we that far in the amendments?</p>]
[<p eid="para_762">The purpose of the amendment No. 102 is to increase the monetary limits in existing legislation to allow for inflation and the new limits are in accordance with the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group.</p>, <p eid="para_763"> With the Chairman's permission, I will explain the section now. </p>]
[<p eid="para_765">The section has some changes when compared with the existing legislation. It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director. The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company. The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels.</p>, <p eid="para_766"> It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted. The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group. The additional requirement is that the person concerned "...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company". The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator. Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company.</p>, <p eid="para_767"> Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital. The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than €100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. In the case of an investment company, subsection (3) will be read as if the requirements are that the value of the issued share capital of the company is not less than €100,000 and that an amount of not less than €100,000 in cash has been paid in consideration for the allotment of shares in the company, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. A person restricted arising from his or her conduct in relation to a company limited by shares is restricted as regards all other company types as well.</p>]
[<p eid="para_769">No.</p>]
[<p eid="para_772">I move amendment No. 103:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_773">In page 670, line 22, to delete “€70,000” and substitute “€100,000”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_774">I move amendment No. 104:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_775">In page 670, line 37, to delete “€70,000” and substitute “€100,000”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_776">I move amendment No. 105:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_777">In page 670, line 46, to delete “€70,000” and substitute “€100,000”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_778">I move amendment No. 106:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_779">In page 671, line 1, to delete “€70,000” and substitute “€100,000”. </p>]
[<p eid="para_780">This is a new section which provides that a "company that has a restricted person" is one "(a) in relation to which a restricted person is appointed or acts in any way, whether directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary;" or a company "in the promotion or formation of which a restricted person is concerned or takes part".</p>]
[<p eid="para_781">This section is new and provides that "the Summary Approval Procedure" may not be utilised by "a company that has a restricted person" except in circumstances where that procedure is being used to affect a member's voluntary winding up. Furthermore, sections 241, relating to arrangements of certain value, and 246, relating to business transactions, of the Bill do not apply to a company that has a restricted person.</p>]
[<p eid="para_782">We are considering introducing an amendment to section 829(2) on Report Stage. The purpose of this amendment will be to make reference to "member" rather than a "subscriber of the constitution". The rationale for this is to ensure that the provision applies to a person who becomes a member some time after its incorporation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_783">I am considering introducing an amendment to section 841 on Report Stage to provide that foreign disqualification orders made before the commencement of the Bill be declared. This is a new section to deal with a situation in which a director becomes disqualified under the law of another state. In such a case, where the company fails to notify the registrar of such a situation, as required by section 150(8) of this Bill, the relevant director will be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order for a period not exceeding the remaining period of the foreign disqualification. This section is new and tightens up the position under the current law whereby a person is only required to notify the registrar of their disqualification under the law of another state upon becoming a director of a company and not where the foreign disqualification occurs subsequent to their becoming a director of an Irish company.</p>, <p eid="para_784"> Question put and agreed to.</p>]
[<p eid="para_785">This is a new section. It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions, such as fraudulent trading and market abuse, the majority of offences under the Companies Acts should be classified according to a four-tier system. As I outlined earlier, category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine, currently set at €6,394 by the Fines Act 2010, previously £5,000. That is an amount no greater than the District Court can impose for any other criminal offence. Category 3 offences will likewise be prosecutable only summarily but on conviction may give rise to a prison sentence of up to six months or a class A fine or both. </p>, <p eid="para_786"> Both category 2 and category 1 offences attract the same consequences when prosecuted summarily, namely, a class A fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Both these categories may also be prosecuted on indictment. In such a case, a category 2 offence will attract a fine of not more than €50,000 or a prison term not exceeding five years or both. A category 1 offence will have a penalty of a fine of not more than €500,000 or up to ten years in prison or both.</p>]
[<p eid="para_789">"No" is the answer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_793">I do not know if I am answering the question correctly, but we cannot go beyond the level that is set for District Court fines.</p>]
[<p eid="para_799">There were quite a lot of numbers in that section. Category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine.</p>]
[<p eid="para_801">Exactly, but we are not in a position to determine what a class A fine is as per this legislation. It is already set out under the terms of the Fines Act 2010.</p>]
[<p eid="para_803">I have not seen an amendment to that effect.</p>]
[<p eid="para_805">It will reflect that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_807">Exactly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_811">I am clear in my own mind and the Deputies have articulated their view.</p>]
[<p eid="para_816">For purposes of clarification, it is important to state that there are fines up to what is the equivalent of £5,000. We are prescribing a maximum but it involves fines up to that amount.</p>]
[<p eid="para_818">Therefore there is a discretion on the part of the court.</p>]
[<p eid="para_820">I move amendment No. 107:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_821">In page 705, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_822">“Civil enforcement of prohibition on trading under misleading name</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_823">876.

[<p eid="para_830">I wish to clarify this in my own mind because we are all getting a bit confused after 107 amendments.</p>]

[<p eid="para_850">I propose on Report Stage to table an amendment dealing with the archiving of documents. The purpose of the amendment is to assist the Companies Registration Office and the National Archives of Ireland, and to align the Bill with current practice.</p>]
[<p eid="para_851">I will give a brief explanation of section 902, which is a new section. It contains transitional provisions relating to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority or IAASA, provides for the continuance of the IAASA and the preservation of its membership except in so far as it is changed by section 903 and other provisions allowing for termination, change and an increase of its membership.</p>]
