SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:30:00+01:00	I thank the individual speakers for their contributions. I wish to question Mr. Sunderland on his submission. If I am reading between the lines correctly, there is a sense that there is a great deal more work to be done on the Bill before the Office of the Data Commissioner is satisfied that it passes muster. Is Mr. Sunderland confident that the issues he flagged are being dealt with at present? If so, how and what is the level of engagement around the issues he is talking about? In the course of his address Mr. Sunderland stated, "It is our understanding that the Bill is not intended to provide a legal basis for large structural government projects which would still need specific primary legislation provision for any data-sharing that would be required". Will he elaborate on this? He also states, "We would also expect to see significantly more detail to provide clarity in terms of how the governance ... and security arrangements ... are to be dealt with". Will he also elaborate on this and give us a sense of where or how his concerns or flagged issues are being dealt with?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:30:00+01:00	Is Mr. Sunderland getting traction for that argument?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:30:00+01:00	It is interesting that Mr. Sunderland has articulated this point. I speak from the research perspective and specifically in the health space to which Mr. Sunderland referred. I am going a little bit off kilter and am not speaking directly to the legislation here, but I am a great believer in the idea that if we are talking about longitudinal studies and anonymising data and so on, there is a mine of information that could be used effectively for positive societal outcomes, particularly in the area of health. I am trying to understand at present if there is a move or an initiative that would allow for that. We have the unique patient identifiers but is there a mechanism that we can drive in a country that is open and has a very strong research infrastructure, where we can begin to look at data and analyse it and drive positive outcomes?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:30:00+01:00	I appreciate that. The Bill provides for what Mr. Sunderland describes as an unambiguous legal basis for data sharing between public bodies. Can any of the three witnesses articulate exactly what is meant by that? What are the underpinning conditions for an unambiguous legal basis? I have not yet read the legislation as we have not had sight of it. I am taking that on trust. I presume that in order to derive an unambiguous legal basis, one will have to be very prescriptive as to how that is done.In other words, he will be kicking the tyres to ensure the consumer, whose data are being used, will have the requisite protections built in.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	Therefore, the underpinning will be in the statutory instrument, if I understood Mr. Sunderland correctly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	Not necessarily.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	Mr. Sunderland should correct me if I am wrong.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	When Mr. Sunderland speaks about the statutory instrument, will he articulate in simple language what it means for each public body? To be honest, I am unclear in my mind.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	Where do the Department of Justice and Equality and Mr. Lowry stand on that issue?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	If I am reading Mr. Carroll's intervention in a particular way, there is perhaps a suggestion that there are already robust legal mechanisms in place.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-18T10:40:00+01:00	From our perspective as the tribune of the people, we want to ensure - as does Mr. Carroll, I am sure - that the individual consumer, citizen or client will have the protections that are vital and that there will be a strong legal basis underpinning them. It seems, therefore, that there is still a little bit of work to be done in underpinning the robustness of the legislation to protect the consumer, which is fair enough. This meeting has been useful for me personally in understanding the dynamics. I want to ask one last question about complaints that might be made a consumer, client or citizen. What protections are built in? Mr. Lowry might wish to answer that question.
