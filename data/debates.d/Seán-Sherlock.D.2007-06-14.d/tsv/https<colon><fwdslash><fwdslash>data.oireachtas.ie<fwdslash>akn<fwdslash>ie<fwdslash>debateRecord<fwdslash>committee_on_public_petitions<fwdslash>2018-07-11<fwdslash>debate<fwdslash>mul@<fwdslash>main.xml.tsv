SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-07-11T13:30:00+01:00	I propose that we go into private session to deal with some matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-07-11T13:40:00+01:00	The first petition for consideration is No. P000034/17. It is proposed to forward a copy of the reply received from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-07-11T13:40:00+01:00	It is duly noted. I thank the Deputy. We are agreed on the course of action to taken on the petition. The next petition is No. P00002/18. It is proposed that the committee decide that the petition is inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(h) and forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition is worthy of further discussion. It is No. P00016/18 and was received from Ms Sarah Joyce. It concerns orchestral provision in Ireland. The petitioner believes orchestras are an intrinsic part of our culture and is seeking to call a halt to the report by RTÉ on the review of its orchestral provision and the establishment of a national strategy on the matter by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. She believes it is not a matter for RTÉ alone. We had a discussion on it in the previous session. The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, will establish an oversight group, to be chaired by her Department, to begin the discussion on the implementation of RTÉ's independent report and ensure the successful transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, NCH. In addition, a working group from RTÉ and the NCH will undertake consultation with the staff concerned. The issue is worthy of further discussion.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-07-11T13:40:00+01:00	For the purposes of clarification, in some respects the petition has been superseded by the fact that RTÉ has replied to the joint committee with a copy of the independent report published on 23 April. It is worth going into its content. It is entitled, RTÉ Orchestras: Ensuring a Sustainable Future, and was produced by the former director of BBC Radio and BBC News, Ms Helen Boaden, with the support of the strategy consulting firm Mediatique. The review looked at the best way to provide high quality and sustainable orchestral services for the Irish public and covered the National Symphony Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. It is important to distinguish between the two. The report's core conclusion is that it is not in the national interest for either of the two orchestras to be closed and that they should be brought up to full strength. However, the report also concludes that it is hard to see how RTÉ can fund even the current level of provision, let alone cover the increase in budgets that would be required to enable the orchestras to return to full strength and undertake touring and educational programmes. It recommends that the National Symphony Orchestra be established as a national cultural institution in its own right, or as part of the National Concert Hall, and be funded by the Government. I believe committee members are agreeing to a further discussion on the matter. Many people are confused about what is going on. Many of us absolutely agree that the output of both orchestras is absolutely vital to Ireland's cultural life, but it is also pertinent for the committee to agree to the suggestion that we invite the director general of RTÉ to come to give us its perspective on the issue. I propose that we do not close the petition at this point in order that we can have that further discussion. We can then see what action the committee might take arising from that discussion.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-07-11T13:40:00+01:00	If members are of a mind not to intervene further, I propose that the joint committee keep the petition open. We will correspond with the director general of RTÉ and invite her to come at the first available opportunity in the autumn for a further discussion on the issue.Is that agreed? Agreed. I should have said we propose to forward copies of the replies received from RTÉ, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment and the office of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to the petitioner. Is that agreed? Agreed.  As we have concluded our business, I propose that we adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 September. Is that agreed? Agreed.  I thank our invaluable secretariat for the work it has done in this session. I also thank members for their co-operation and hope they will enjoy the break.
