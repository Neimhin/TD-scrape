</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_470">In page 4, line 17, after "enactment" to insert "amended by or".</p>, <p eid="para_471">The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarity and avoid any constitutional difficulty in respect of the offences to which the section applies.  Clearly, it would be legally improper to impose the new penalties on persons convicted after the commencement date for an offence committed before the commencement date.  The European Convention on Human Rights expressly states that a higher penalty than the penalty enforced at the material time of the offence cannot be imposed on a person.  This amendment will avoid any challenge based on this point by making clear that the new penalties will only apply to offences committed on, or after, the commencement date.</p>]
[<p eid="para_473">It could be argued that the existing Bill is ambiguous, in that it does not state clearly whether it refers to the conviction or the offence that occurred before the commencement date.  It is a matter of trying to tighten up the wording.  That is our approach.</p>]
[<p eid="para_475">I appreciate the Minister's response and will withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p>]

This has disappeared from the Bill, although it seems an appropriate provision to maintain the hierarchy of penalties between summary conviction and conviction on indictment.  We suggest that this be re-inserted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_588">I will not delay proceedings except to say that I agree with the tenor and tone of the amendments tabled by the Minister.  The primary purpose of the legislation is to ensure that people who are not criminals but who transgress or make mistakes will not be imprisoned as a result of not paying fines.  The legislation is also designed to put in place a process to ensure that people will have every avenue open to them in order that they might pay fines.</p>, <p eid="para_589">Will the Minister clarify the position with regard to people's financial circumstances?  Do I understand that there is some degree of sympathy for persons who may have transgressed and who might find themselves subject to fines?  Will the new process take into account an individual's inability to pay in the context of both their outgoings and their overall earnings?  The Minister referred, in some sympathy, to persons who may have unintentionally transgressed and indicated that, for obvious reasons, he wants to keep them out of prison.  Is it the case that an appointed receiver will be in a position to recover property from someone who does not pay a fine?</p>, <p eid="para_590">The amendments before the House improve the legislation.  The bottom line is that citizens must be given every means and opportunity possible to pay fines and avoid prison.  In addition, the legislation must contain a mechanism which ensures that no one will take advantage of any perceived softening in the approach of putting in place a system of fines in the first instance.  I welcome the amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_800">I presume the clock starts now.  On the recovery order in section 16, subsection 2 states: "Before making a recovery order, the court shall conduct an inquiry into the financial circumstances of the person who has failed to pay the fine concerned and may require the person to provide the court with such information as it may specify relating to those circumstances."  Although I am not speaking specifically to the amendments we are dealing with now — I wish to give notice that I will not be moving amendments Nos. 49, 50 and 51 — they do deal with this area.  We are seeking to ensure that all possibilities are exhausted concerning a person's particular set of financial circumstances.  That person's outgoings should potentially be taken into account also in adjudicating on the issue before going to a recovery order.  We want to ensure that a person who is not a serial offender or a hardy perennial before the courts, and who may have transgressed but who ordinarily is a very good citizen, would have every opportunity to pay the fine if they do not have the means immediately at their disposal.  I would like to get further clarity on that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_808">I move amendment No. 52:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2009.18.dail.4.amd_52"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_809">In page 11, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_810">"(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)</i>, where a person is convicted of an offence for which a fine or a sentence of imprisonment, or both, may be imposed, the court—</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_811">(<i>a</i>) shall consider whether a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_812">(<i>b</i>) shall, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, take into account the person’s financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine to impose in respect of the offence;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_813">(<i>c</i>) shall not, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case but that, having regard to the person’s financial circumstances, undue hardship would be caused by the imposition of a fine of any amount greater than a nominal amount, impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of such a fine if a sentence of imprisonment would not be appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, but may in that event direct the payment of the fine by instalments for such period as the court shall fix, but without prejudice to the power of the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of payment of a fine in such amount as the court considers is within the capacity of the defendant to pay.”.</p>, <p eid="para_814">I take on board what the Minister has said.  These amendments seek to ensure a sense of appropriateness in each individual case.  I am satisfied that the Minister's position on these amendments has already been dealt with by the earlier amendments.  Therefore I intend to withdraw the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_950">I am not against the amendment <i>per se, </i>but it states that the Courts Service “may” from time to time, publish in such a manner as it considers appropriate, including on the Internet, a list of the names and addresses of persons who have failed to pay fines imposed on them by the due date of payment.  I assume, since the word “may” is used that there is no obligation on the Courts Service to publish the names.  Without being sarcastic, when somebody presents himself or herself before the court, there is a good chance the court reporter from <i>The Corkman </i>or <i>The Leitrim Observer </i>or any other local newspaper will publish the person’s name in the following edition.  I suggest the persons concerned will have been subjected to enough embarrassment through that.  There may be circumstances where this imposes another administrative cost on the Courts Service.  I do not think the Minister has set out how much this will cost to administer.  By virtue of use of the word “may”, I wonder if it will ever be used at all.  That is a question, by the way.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1093">I support this Bill which should have the effect of fundamentally changing our culture by ensuring that everyone who gets behind the wheel of a car does so in the full knowledge that new penalties will be imposed for certain driving behaviours.  As a result of this legislation, those who drink will have to significantly change their behaviour.  We need to modify how we, as a society, deal with the issue of alcohol and the only way to achieve this objective is to ensure there is no ambiguity about the blood alcohol limits that apply while driving.</p>, <p eid="para_1094">Having served on Cork County Council with him, I have the greatest respect for the previous speaker, Deputy Christy O'Sullivan.  I, too, am only too well aware of the conditions experienced by rural dwellers who are frequently disadvantaged by virtue of their rural isolation and experience a lack of access to services.  I find it difficult to listen to Government Deputies deplore the state of rural roads and the problem of rural isolation.</p>, <p eid="para_1095">If people are to have access to the services they will require as a result of the measures provided for in the Bill, we must ensure ancillary services are in place to meet their demands and needs.  For instance, in my area Bus Éireann has decided to withdraw the No. 66 route which serves a rural area and individuals living in rural isolation.  They include older people who travel to towns such as Fermoy, Ballyhooly and Castletownroche to enjoy a drop before taking a bus home later in the evening.  Many of these people do not drive and will no longer have access to the service as a result of the decision to close the route.  This problem is a function of Government policy because an ancillary rural transport programme is not in place to pick up the slack arising from the loss of the service.  In particular, a night time bus service is not in place to facilitate those who want to act responsibility but are unable to avail of a bus service.  Government policy militates against the very people who experience rural isolation.</p>, <p eid="para_1096">We need to be clear about the implications of the legislation.  If we support the Bill on the basis that driver behaviour must change significantly, we must also take into account that some people, by virtue of residing in rural areas and deciding to behave responsibly as required under the legislation, will no longer have access to the local pub.  Current policy does not meet their needs.  If Bus Éireann drops routes at a rate of knots and the rural transport programme is not rolled out quickly enough to pick up the slack, particularly with regard to night time services, those who live in the rural areas  obviously will be affected.  This issue needs to be teased out in greater detail.</p>, <p eid="para_1097">On the commencement of the sections which will become operational before mid-2011, I refer to the Bills digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Unit.  It states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1098">. . . different sections may become operational before others.  Some of the provisions of the Bill will not come into force until mid 2011.  This is because evidential breath-testing (EBT) machines used in Garda stations to measure the alcohol in a driver's breath cannot be recalibrated to the 20mg/100mL limit as yet.</p>, <p eid="para_1099">What is the current state of play with regard to the Garda's capacity to recalibrate the EBT machines as required?</p>, <p eid="para_1100">I understand the legislation reduces blood alcohol limits and introduces mandatory alcohol testing for drivers who are involved in traffic collisions as well as roadside preliminary impairment testing to detect drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  One would expect the Government to have ensured all necessary technology was available prior to or in parallel with the implementation of the legislation.  Will the Minister provide an update on the Garda's capacity to use the required technology?</p>, <p eid="para_1101">On road collision statistics, while I do not doubt the bona fides of the Road Safety Authority, I have a healthy scepticism about some of the statistics produced on road traffic accidents.  The Government has stated its commitment to improving road safety and the number of deaths on Irish roads declined to 240 in 2009.  It is estimated that 25% of road accidents and 33% of fatal road accidents are attributable to alcohol.  I often wonder how such statistics are measured and what process is used by the Road Safety Authority or Garda Síochána to produce their statistics, particularly those relating to road fatalities.  I am not sceptical about the figures but I question the qualitative methods used to compile the statistics used for making an argument for a particular proposal.  I ask for a response in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_1102">I welcome the provisions on new drivers.  We cannot disregard the link between driver impairment and alcohol consumption.  It has been proven scientifically and is supported by anecdotal evidence.  Common sense says that if a person imbibes, their ability to operate a machine or vehicle will be impaired.</p>, <p eid="para_1103">The Vintners' Federation of Ireland opposed the reduction in the limit and I can see its point.  Anecdotal evidence suggests that their regular rural customers might drink a pint and a drop before ambling home.  They never go beyond their usual level of imbibing, which is a social outlet for them.  We must be able to provide for those who use the pub as a social outlet.  If they are not able to drive, how will we facilitate them?  Some of them will be able to get taxis while others will travel with neighbours.  However, do we now have to tell them that there is no other alternative?  In implementing the legislation, we need to strike a balance and speak for those people as well.</p>, <p eid="para_1104">The section creates a distinction between newly qualified and other full licence holders.  Novice drivers are subject to a lower BAC and will be automatically disqualified for three months if an administrative fixed penalty is accepted, or disqualified for six months if found guilty after a court hearing.  Other licence holders do not face automatic disqualification following a first conviction.  Can the Minister of State clarify if this is an age-related distinction, or does it merely distinguish between novices and experienced drivers?  Is any qualification brought into play concerning an older person who may have transgressed?  It is not that I am advocating a particular position on that, but I am seeking clarification in the Minister of State's response.</p>, <p eid="para_1105">On balance we are experiencing a serious erosion of services in rural areas.  Some argue that the decline of the rural pub reflects a decline in overall infrastructure, particularly roads.  As someone who meets members of the public every day, I hold that view myself, because they are finding it increasingly difficult to access services.  That is particularly the case for older people.  I would distinguish between older and elderly people, because the use of the word "elderly" sometimes implies a certain infirmity.  Many older people are mobile, although they may not drive.  We always had a sense of inter-generational solidarity in this country, but it is being undermined by stealth.  When drafting legislation we must, therefore, ensure that if it impacts on one service we should try to replace it with another service if possible.</p>, <p eid="para_1106">The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that lives are saved and one cannot qualify that.  While it is a black and white issue, there are grey areas where some public services will be diminished.  Government policy on rural transport should be structured in such a way that people can access community centres or pubs outside normal office hours if they wish to do so.  We must facilitate them in this respect.</p>]
