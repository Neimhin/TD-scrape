[<p eid="para_48">I have listened to what the Financial Regulator had to say.  When he addressed this committee on 29 April I asked the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_49">If a downturn occurs in the construction sector and there is potential for defaulting on loans, does that leave the banking sector vulnerable?  Is there a role for the regulator in that regard in seeking to modify the behaviour of banks in terms of the way they loan to their customers in the future?</p>, <p eid="para_50">Aside from other questions I asked on the day, the response I got to that particular question from Mr. Neary was as follows:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_51">There is no evidence that lending for speculative property development starved other sectors of resources.  I have no sense of that happening but will reflect on the question and, if there is any evidence that it has taken place, I will revert to the Deputy with a reply.</p>, <p eid="para_52">The Financial Regulator's submission to the joint committee on 29 April when we dealt with the exposure of Northern Rock is remarkably different from its submission today.  I put it to Mr. Neary that he has failed in his task, that at best the regulatory regime was very weak and that ultimately the cost for those seriously exposed will fall to the taxpayer.  At what point did he telephone the Minister for Finance to set alarm bells ringing about the banking crisis bound to unfold, in the light of the information now available, in terms of the exposure of Irish banks?  He must have known about this, as he must have had his ear to the ground and, if not, why not?</p>, <p eid="para_53">Following on from Deputy Ardagh's question, I would be more blunt.  Is Mr. Neary's position untenable?  If not, does he think the measures he is proposing will give solace to those with 35 year 100% mortgages who are seriously exposed in the current climate?  Does he believe the European regulatory framework is a proper regulatory framework?  Does he believe one regulator per country acting unilaterally is not the way to go?  The only way to deal with the crisis — we do not know what will happen tomorrow — is through a cross-compliance structure, an inter-European regulatory framework, whereby all member states would subscribe to the same set of rules.  In the absence of such a structure, the euro is under threat.  On 30 September the Government acted in what it termed as the country's best interest but it could be argued that it acted unilaterally.  Others followed suit but now the game has changed in the light of the United Kingdom's intervention.</p>, <p eid="para_54">I do not understand how such a level of borrowing was allowed to continue.  Mr. Neary will have to explain to the joint committee why the banks were able to lend money hand over fist without anybody putting a halt to it or without political responsibility.  Perhaps it is a fact that he did not communicate with the Minister for Finance.  If he did to set alarm bells ringing, we would like to hear how and when it was done.</p>]
[<p eid="para_80">On a point of order, Mr. Neary said in his statement to the committee that speculative lending to the construction and property sectors amounted to €39.1 billion, of which €24 billion was supported by additional collateral or alternative sources of cashflow.  This leaves a balance of €15 billion secured directly on the underlying property.  Correct me if I am wrong, but this potentially leaves the taxpayer exposed to a guarantee of €15 billion if the loans are defaulted on.  At what point was this information known to Mr. Neary?  Has it only come to light in the past week or so or was it known some months ago?</p>, <p eid="para_81">My main question for the Financial Regulator is what relationship does it share with the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance?  It must have known much earlier that things were not going according to plan and that they were not right in the banking sector.  What mechanisms have been used by the regulator?  Mr. Neary is using certain language and it is hard to argue vociferously against him.  He seems to be genuine regarding what he was trying to achieve.  I am worried that the Financial Regulator did not bang the table enough, if I may put it that way, in its interactions with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance and that this is part of the crisis.</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">That is what we are here to do.  If the taxpayer is to underwrite a guarantee for the banking sector, it is fair that we should ask pertinent questions and have an open dialogue on the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_246">If €69.3 billion has been loaned, a question arises in respect of the insurance covering that debt.  In addition, the issue of speculation on credit default swaps has emerged of late.  To what extent, ultimately, are the Irish taxpayer, Government and banks exposed in this regard?  Does the regulator take a view on the issue of credit default swaps?</p>, <p eid="para_247">Moreover, the point that was made about securitisation and its relevance to the position in which we find ourselves at present should be repeated because I did not quite follow it.</p>]
