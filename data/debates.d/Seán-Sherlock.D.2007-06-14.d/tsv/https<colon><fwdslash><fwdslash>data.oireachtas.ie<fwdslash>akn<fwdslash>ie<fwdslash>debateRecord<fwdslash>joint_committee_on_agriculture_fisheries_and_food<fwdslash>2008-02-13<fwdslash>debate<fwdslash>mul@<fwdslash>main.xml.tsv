SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will not expound my theories on the vast potential of fisheries that this maritime nation squandered over the years because of political expediency.  That is for another day.  However, as I understand the submission it relates to the 400, plus 850, plus 8,000 boats that are operating in third country waters or outside EU waters.  Do the legislative proposals place a greater regulatory burden on those vessels, on top of the existing regulatory framework, vis-à-vis reporting and other bureaucratic mechanisms?  Will the proposal in any way limit the scope of Irish vessels to be able to fish in third country waters?  Will the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations’ agreements be limited by the European Union?  If we are talking about third country or non-EU waters, if we can expand the scope for Irish fishermen to maximise their potential in those waters, that is what we should try to do.  If legislation is proposed which seeks to limit that, perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should look at that issue.  If I am missing the point of the legislative proposal in that regard then I stand corrected.
