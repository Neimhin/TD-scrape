[<p eid="para_47">I apologise for being late, but I was delayed.  I welcome the Minister to the meeting.  I have monitored her progress from afar with some admiration because her rise within politics has been phenomenal.  I admire her work on North-South relations and in addressing agriculture from an island of Ireland perspective.  She has been strong in that respect and it is a perspective with which I agree.  Speaking as a member of the same generation, she has been an inspiration.  I do not mean to be ageist——</p>]
[<p eid="para_49">I empathise with the Minister in that sense and congratulate her on her success to date.</p>, <p eid="para_50">Since Deputy Creed outlined many of the issues in which I have an interest, I will not repeat those points.  Agricultural policy must be undertaken from an island of Ireland perspective.  If I have missed a presentation and this point has been taken up, I apologise.  The co-operation between the two Departments with responsibility for agriculture is necessary and vital.  To what extent is the relationship working and will there be a deepening of the relationship, particularly given what the CAP health check will mean for Irish agriculture?  That is an issue that will have major significance for Irish farmers, North and South.</p>]
