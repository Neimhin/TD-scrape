SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-06-11T13:50:00+01:00	The big ticket item at present is negotiating Horizon 2020, which is the next framework for research expenditure in the European Union. The Irish Presidency is chairing those negotiations, which will be subject to co-decision procedure with the Commission and the European Parliament. Horizon 2020 will offer a package of measures worth €70 billion or more, with a specific target of 20% for SME engagement compared to 15% in the current framework programme. We believe this will have a major stimulus effect in terms of SME engagement and job creation throughout the European Union and in Ireland in particular. Our overarching philosophy is to accelerate the economic and societal return from the public investment in research in order to deliver high quality jobs. In addition to Horizon 2020, we are also implementing our own research prioritisation exercise which brings together the State funders of research. We have prioritised 14 key areas to maximise the economic and societal impact of our investment in research. A process is under way of developing the 14 action plans, involving all the State funders of research and the HEA to ensure maximum impact. We are also pursuing smart investment in research centres at scale and with critical mass. In 2013, we announced seven new large scale SFI research centres supporting more than 800 scientists. These centres will enhance IDA's capacity to attract foreign direct investment. The recent €300 million announcement included €200 million from the State's funders of research and €100 million from industry. Many of the industrial players are in the FDI sector. Activities funded through the research centres include big data, advanced food research and marine energy research. Later this afternoon we will be discussing the extension of SFI's mandate to include applied research and to allow it to fund research proposals closer to the applied research arena in order to accelerate the exploitation of research for economic benefit. We are setting targets in a number of other areas, including high-potential start-up units, technology centres through the institutes of technology and the SFI funded strategic research clusters. I would be happy to speak further on these activities if members so wish.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:30:00+01:00	A wide range of questions have been asked. Horizon 2020 involves a co-decision procedure and will require the agreement of the European Parliament, the Commission and the member states.I am presiding over the negotiations with our team in Brussels, through the permanent representation. Ours is a partial general approach, whereby the Council of Ministers has agreed a negotiating position relative to the European Parliament. There are certain areas of inflection, or certain challenges regarding the full cost model. We are trying to move towards a simplified procedure under which calls can be issued. The simpler the mechanism, the greater the access for individual researchers and research entities. There are other differences between the Council and the Parliament, for example, on the rules of participation. We have gone through six trilogues, under which the three entities have tried to move on to the next stage. We are on trilogue No. 7 and will move towards trilogue No. 8 in the latter half of this week, if I am not mistaken. We hope to reach a final conclusion by the end of the Irish Presidency because we want to ensure a smooth transition between the seventh framework programme, FP7, and Horizon 2020 so that there can be clarity regarding the latter throughout the EU's research infrastructure, particularly in Ireland, and it can start seamlessly on 1 January 2014. We are still in the midst of the political negotiations with the other two institutions. An additional €5 million was provided to the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, to allow for payments that would otherwise have been made in 2013. This allowed for a lower allocation in the overall budget cut. Some 18 capital projects are still progressing, as are 15 current projects. Eighteen current projects were originally targeted, but the 15 are delivering approximately the same outputs, namely, 339 PhDs as opposed to the original target of 342 PhDs. Seven new Science Foundation Ireland centres have been announced. Is Deputy Tóibín seeking clarity on these?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	We have surpassed the target.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	On big data, marine energy, drug delivery, food for health and perinatal research, which is based out of UCC and the Cork University Maternity Hospital. The overarching philosophy is to ramp up into world class research centres and to increase industry engagement but this does not preclude us from continuing our funding of regional technology centres, which are not necessarily mapped onto the 14 research prioritisation areas. Industry engages with the technology centres through the institutes of technology after identifying industry challenges. We should have distributed a note on the distribution of the centres as well as the activities ongoing in same. I can discuss this matter now, if the Deputy wishes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	On technology gateways, we have-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	Technology gateways are housed within institutes of technology in Letterkenny, Athlone, Limerick, Cork, etc. They have various themes. For example, Waterford's theme is software solutions and mobile devices and the theme of CIT's Technologies for Embedding Computing, TEC, centre is embedded electronics for energy, water and location-based applications. Where specific thematic areas exist, industry has go-to points to optimise its opportunities. I am trying to get through all of the committee's questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	The €100 million from industry to the SFI research centres is cash or in kind. The intellectual property protocol allows for arrangements to be agreed between industry and publicly funded research organisations as regards individual entities. The 2013 target for tech centres-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	There is a set of guidelines as well as an agreed IP protocol, a document on which is published. Regarding the research centres, one must allow for a certain degree of flexibility if one wants a greater degree of industrial engagement in the funding of research. A designated technology transfer officer within each institution manages the relationship between principal investigators and industry. If one is too restrictive, one might curtail the level of economic activity or the opportunities arising from the engagement between publicly funded research and industry.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:40:00+01:00	I will revert to the Deputy on this matter, as I must on the other figures to which he referred, namely, the value of the equity holding in Enterprise Ireland. We will establish tech centres for medical devices, connected health and pharma-manufacturing. These will map onto the 14 priority research areas. Dairy technology and analytics are two of those areas. I will revert if further questions must be answered. Turning to Deputy Conaghan, the fundamental question is not of whether it is basic versus applied research. They are on the same continuum. However, we borrow approximately €300 million per week. In this light, it is pertinent that the State and its funders of research would outline a set of priorities to maximise the impact of that research in terms of creating new economic opportunities, namely, creating jobs and high-potential start-ups as well as resourcing the small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, that will sustain the economy.We look at it from the perspective that perhaps 250,000 jobs were lost between 2008 and 2011. Through this prioritisation programme, and the technology sector centres and prioritisation areas I mentioned, we can begin to leverage more from industry to create those new opportunities. We have State funding and taxpayers' money coming together with industry cash or in-kind contributions to try to ensure we can retain the number of jobs we have within the foreign direct investment sector and also that we can grow new opportunities within the domestic or indigenous sector. There is a strong belief that by leveraging that intellectual property and creating more opportunities for scientists to move into the entrepreneurial sphere, the economy can be sustained over a longer period. One does not come at the expense of the other, however. The research prioritisation exercise is part of the funding puzzle, if one wishes. As well as the HEA bloc grant there are other areas such as the Irish Research Council and other funding agencies that can still fund areas of blue-sky or basic research. There are reasonable amounts of money to sustain the relatively small pockets within the humanities and social sciences, areas, for example, that may feel they are outliers in any new process of prioritisation. The two are not mutually exclusive. Even within the humanities and social sciences, specifically the latter, there are potential opportunities within the prioritisation areas which can be mapped onto health or data analytics to provide new opportunities. It is about taking a more lateral view about how we fund into the research space.  I hope that answers the question adequately.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	We are doing a metrics paper at present and will bring it to Cabinet. This will give the Deputy the context of metrics and how patents map onto it - or not, as the case may be. The question one must ask oneself is whether patents are an accurate measure of economic activity. What long-term effect do they have in terms of creating jobs, etc.? Of themselves, as intellectual property, patents are important in terms of protecting the good ideas and the new innovations people develop. What we have sought to do from the research perspective, and are doing, is to bring a paper to Cabinet. The Minister has a strong input in this regard. Its purpose is to ensure that wherever the State invests, through all the funders of research, for example, the HEA, Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board and all the other State funders, it will map out or measure the impact of that research funding. That is measured in terms of publications and in the numbers of jobs created. One tries to measure the societal impact by looking at indicators such as the European Union innovation index, and so on. There are metrics around publications of papers, etc. The key point is that we are ensuring that where we are investing we have a set of criteria laid down such that the metrics have to be measured in terms of the impact and the number of jobs created. As that is done it informs our approach. I refer to the SFI centres.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	This work cannot be measured geographically - the geographical spread is incidental. It is based on excellence, as it must be. If one were to skew it, based on geography----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	The criterion is excellent science. A criterion of excellence exists in terms of how one funds research; it is the fundamental pillar for any funding call or new opportunity. One cannot discriminate between various geographical areas. If, for example, one wanted to fund into south Kerry it has to be based on the pillar of excellence; it cannot be because the funding call is from south Kerry. If one examines the calls and looks at where the money has been disbursed, what has been forced is a major collaboration between institutions that might not, historically, have collaborated with each other. I refer to the CLARITY and INSIGHT centres, for example, where DCU, UCD and NUIG are coming together, which is a significant investment in the area of data analytics. One also maps the industry engagement, which involves industry from all across the country, geographically speaking. The geographical indicator takes second place to the pillar of excellence. One has to fund excellent research regardless of where it comes from, geographically. I hope that makes sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	There is a headline target under the Europe 2020 strategy to raise DARD to 2.5% of GNP.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	Yes, but in Ireland's case there was an amount relating to persons abroad. As a result, it is argued that GNP is a better measure of the value than GDP. The difference between GNP and GDP is that in the latter one factors out earnings that go back to the mothership. The GNP target is probably a better-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T14:50:00+01:00	There is no massaging of figures. What we are talking about here is a true indicator, which is better.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:20:00+01:00	On a practical note, we will distribute the information on the technology centres' status so that members can trace their lineage from the establishment of two in March 2010 to the proposed three centres in 2013. We can provide a further briefing note on Enterprise Ireland's research and development programmes. The committee has received a good note detailing the practical overview of the innovation vouchers, the research and development fund, technology centres and high-potential start-ups, HPSUs. Were the committee to facilitate me, I would welcome an opportunity to return and delve deeper into the issue of research and innovation. Since the Estimates process is condensed, leading to a concertina effect, one would appreciate an opportunity to return, interrogate the landscape further and encourage members to visit some of the research centres in a co-ordinated fashion. Before I became a Minister of State, these matters could be nebulous and theoretical. If one gets one's fingers dirty by seeing what the researchers are doing in the centres and how they engage with industry, one has a chance to understand the situation fully. I am not saying that members do not understand it, but my experience of visiting the centres and seeing their work for myself helped me to capture what they were doing. I wish to address the issue of silos. The Minister hit on it in terms of the health innovation hub. As the Minister of State with responsibility for innovation, my role is to try to break down those silos. The recent announcement represents the largest investment ever, with €300 million from the industry as well as State funding for research organisations, institutes of technology and universities. This will break down the traditional silos, elements of the industry will collaborate with one another along thematic lines, and the silos within academic circles will also be broken down. We are in a new disposition, in that people must collaborate if they are to flourish and survive. This is the underlying principle. I thank the Chairman and will leave matters there.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	I acknowledge the sentiments expressed by Deputy Calleary on the role of Science Foundation Ireland. I thank Deputies Calleary and Tóibín for submitting the various amendments and the first proposed amendment is essentially already captured when one considers section 7(1) in conjunction with section 7(6), specifically lines 13 to 18, inclusive. The wording of the Bill as presented has been undertaken in consultation with the advisory council on science, technology and innovation, and I am satisfied that the wording of the Bill as it stands is appropriate. It will enable us to leverage more from the ever-increasing SFI investments and it also grants SFI some flexibility with regard to future funding calls for the development of Ireland's enterprise development and without diminution in standards of research excellence. Therefore, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	With regard to amendment No. 5, it is the Government's intention to inform the Houses of the Oireachtas of the strategic areas of opportunities for Ireland. This will largely be centred on priority areas as set out in the recommendations arising from the national research prioritisation exercise and through the prioritisation action group, whose work continues. I am currently chairing that process. I am satisfied that we could consider this for further discussion on Report Stage, taking into account the submission made by the Deputy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I appreciate the concerns and subtleties of the point made by Deputy Calleary. I was concerned that by including "by another review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" we might somehow lessen the rigour of SFI's renowned review process of excellence. There is a danger inherent in that if it is dissipated in any way, the core of SFI would be diminish. I assure the Deputy that nobody is seeking to diminish that in any way and the inclusion of the words "review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" is absolutely necessary. Such a requirement is primarily due to the smaller grant-funded programmes that SFI is now supporting in the promotion of the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects, where SFI's rigorous international scientific peer review process is not an appropriate mechanism to use. Deputies should be aware that in March 2012, as part of our reform programme, we transferred responsibility for the Discover Science & Engineering, DSE, programme from Forfás to SFI, given the synergies that exist between the DSE-supported actions and certain SFI science awareness supports. In addition, some of the smaller grants that SFI administers, such as the conferences and workshops programme that works to attract top-class conferences and leading scientists to Ireland, are not internationally peer reviewed and nor should they be. As is increasingly the case, where opportunities arise for SFI to co-fund with another agency, Department or research entity - in Ireland or in collaboration across international borders - it may not always be appropriate or possible to utilise an international scientific peer review process. It is critical that we ensure in such instances that whatever review mechanism is used by SFI or it is party to, such a process should be of an appropriately high standard and of international best practice. For these reasons, the inclusion of the words "or by any other review process equivalent to relevant international best practice" is absolutely necessary in the section.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	I assure Deputies that SFI will continue to operate its rigorous multi-stage scientific peer review for the main cohort of funding instruments, such as research centres, the investigators' programme, professorships and other principal investigator programmes. The peer review process has been the bedrock of Science Foundation Ireland since its establishment in order to ensure continued scientific excellence and relevance to the enterprise base. We do not want to dilute that in any way, shape or form and we want to continue that strong pillar while allowing flexibility in other areas of opportunity, as I referred to earlier.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	We can accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4 without any problem.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T15:50:00+01:00	Just to be sure there is no ambiguity about it, we will come back to this on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:00:00+01:00	SFI provides research grant funding to higher education institutions and research-performing entities and as such an entity must satisfy a number of criteria to be deemed an eligible body to compete for SFI funding calls. On page 5, lines 20 onwards, particularly lines 32 to 39, inclusive, the Bill clearly sets out how the extension of the remit of SFI will be provided for on an all-Ireland basis. This section therefore already provides for the inclusion of any relevant institution in Northern Ireland, including those established under the Good Friday Agreement, and the important operational matter will be whether any such institution, be it based in the North or the South, meets with SFI criteria to be deemed an eligible body to compete for SFI funding calls. It is not necessary to accept the proposed amendment. We all adhere to the belief that the underlying principle of creating those opportunities subject to the right criteria is the overarching principle in the legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:00:00+01:00	It is on page 5, lines 20 onwards, particularly lines 32 to 39, inclusive. The Bill clearly sets out how the extension of SFI's remit will be provided for on an all-Ireland basis.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:00:00+01:00	I can see where Deputy Calleary is coming from in terms of the spirit of this amendment. Appointments to the board of SFI are made by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in consultation with the Minister for Education and Skills and with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In reality, this proposed amendment captures what is already established practice when, annually, the two longest serving SFI board members must retire from the board each July. As part of the board appointments process, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation actively considers the existing competencies of the SFI board membership and examines the gaps arising from board retirements or other vacancies that might arise separately to the annual retirement process. The Minister also examines the emerging scientific or industrial expertise needs and trends from which the board would benefit, the gender representation on the board at all times, the ongoing evolution of Ireland's research system and in particular the maturing and increasing relevance of SFI investments, foreign direct investment, linkages and our indigenous base. The Government has also established a practice whereby appointments to State boards are advertised publicly via the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and applications invited. Such an advertisement regarding the forthcoming July 2013 SFI board vacancies is live on the PAS website, publicjobs.ie. As part of this process there is a detailed list of competencies which potential SFI board members would need to meet and if we were to accept the Deputy's proposed amendment in this regard, we would also need to significantly broaden the proposed wording of the Bill further. In this case on page 6 between lines 6 and 7 we would include text along the following lines: "In appointing members of the board the Minister shall seek to ensure it contains a balance of expertise in such areas as academic research, commercial research and development, corporate governance, entrepreneurship, research funding, development and venture funding, public engagement-outreach education, research and development, industrial policy development implementation and assessment both internationally and nationally, awareness and detailed knowledge of Ireland's research landscape, public sector experience and higher education systems," among many other things. However, given the established practice undertaken by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regarding board appointments and the openness of the PAS process which the Government has established regarding appointments to State boards, and the lengthy list of competencies I have just mentioned, I am of the view that the Deputy's proposed amendment is unnecessary, therefore I am not in a position to accept it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:00:00+01:00	The question here is whether one adheres to that by way of primary legislation or does it require a cultural or systemic change in our thinking. The view regarding the specific amendment is that while one would absolutely and utterly accept the sentiment expressed and the spirit of the amendment, putting forward a specific quota target for this piece of legislation would not be appropriate. Culturally, within SFI three of the past five appointments have been female. I take the point about driving a cultural and behavioural change across the State board and agency infrastructure but in SFI there has been a significant redistribution in gender balance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:10:00+01:00	While I am not accepting the amendment, I agree with the sentiment and spirit of the amendment. If one was to look at the scientific or the research landscape, there is clear evidence that female researchers can reach a certain stage but very few break through that glass ceiling. That applies to other sectors of the economy. I am not in a position to accept an amendment to enforce a gender quota at this stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:10:00+01:00	I am willing to look again at the issue on Report Stage but we must distinguish between the role of the chief scientific adviser and the director general of Science Foundation Ireland. The question is whether the chief scientific adviser has a role in interrogating or advising on Government policy because Government policy is determined by those who are given the mandate by the people to direct how policy is implemented, subject to advice, but not necessarily through the chief scientific adviser role. We are lucky that we have a chief scientific adviser and we have continued to keep that position in Ireland. As there are only about seven countries worldwide that have a chief scientific adviser, we are in a unique position given that we have been able to keep that role in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. I understand the amendment and perhaps we need to examine it further. The appointment of the chief scientific adviser is co-terminous with his appointment as director general. The current arrangement will not always necessarily be the case. We can have a further discussion on the issue on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:10:00+01:00	There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that we are taking the foot off the pedal in terms of basic research and moving into applied research. We are extending the remit but, as I said at the earlier committee meeting, one is the logical extension of the other. It is an almost impossible task and would require significant additional resources to be deployed within Science Foundation Ireland and also across the higher education sector and would be burdensome for the scientific community. In reality, such a proposal would add little value over and above the systems that Science Foundation Ireland has in place. Perhaps I can explain it briefly. One needs to appreciate fully the nature and increasing complexity of the research continuum which is not just at the national level but is global. One needs to realise how it spans from the blue skies fundamental research through oriented basic research and on towards the applied research arena. Internationally, there is the ever-increasing convergence across different scientific disciplines as well as significantly different timelines in certain sectors. For example, ICT related research evolves far more rapidly than the life sciences and biosciences research areas, and the lines between pure fundamental research and truly applied research can be very difficult to distinguish. Research can often span different areas and across different types. For instance, ICT related research will cross over into the life sciences, energy and many other research areas and will typically encompass basic clinical translational and applied research. Science Foundation Ireland administers more than 450 live research grants with an awards commitment value of €400 million spanning out to 2019. On top of these SFI commitment levels there are also industry contributions in excess of €100 million from a significant cohort of the 700 plus industry partners directly connected to SFI funded researchers. The SFI grants awards will have differing durations and review processes which means that the SFI funding model and grants commitments and expenditure process is constantly evolving. Invariably, there will also be a range of other funding streams in research teams that involve certain SFI supported scientists whereby the SFI element may be only one aspect, along with private industry funding, EU funding, contributions from other private sources or other national funders. Committee members will appreciate that in recent years, Science Foundation Ireland-funded teams leveraged in excess of €150 million per annum from sources other than its SFI grants, and usually close to 60% comes from non-Exchequer sources. In 2012, the amount leveraged from other sources was approximately €171 million. There is a complexity involved when trying to analyse and breakdown the funding between the various points on the research continuum. There is the SFI provided element and we must also distinguish between the other funding sources within a year and in each year. Funding is a constantly evolving and highly complex process. SFI already manages the process very tightly and effectively with its small staffing cohort of about 45 persons. Furthermore, one must remember that SFI is one of our research funding agencies. Even if one was keen to undertake the very resource intensive ask arising from the amendment, one would still not have a full picture of Ireland's overall research landscape. Typically, SFI research investments account for just over 25% of Ireland's overall public research investments.  The proposal would also place an added burden on those in the scientific community if we were to constantly press them to categorise their various projects and associated funding between oriented, basic and applied research. Such an exercise would, most likely, also eat further into the Exchequer's research provision to the higher education institutions. It would mean that colleges would have to deploy additional administrative supports. We need to ease the administrative burden on the scientific community in order for them to do what they do best which is to undertake excellent research with impact and relevance. On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:20:00+01:00	The first thing to remember is that research prioritisation does not account for the entire SFI budget. We seek to move or evolve the research landscape in a way that will ensure that all of the State funders of research are, pretty much, on the same trajectory. One then seeks to identify new areas of opportunity where co-funding arises. For instance, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Teagasc and the SFI recently. It identified new areas of opportunity in a food related space. Even though food for health is within the priority area, there are other areas of basic research opportunities that can be mined from that type of memorandum of understanding. Similarly, the Irish Research Council funds an industry-based PhD. One of the areas in which I am trying to drive a greater coherence in education is the area of stem science technology, engineering and maths. We have a National Centre of Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning. Perhaps we could drive new areas of funding opportunities into stem science through entities like the national centre of excellence, DCU, UCC and other areas. I do not just mean on the pedagogue side but also funding to ensure that teachers at primary and post-primary have the ability and the benefit of excellent research that would inform continual and professional development. That initiative would build up new knowledge areas that would provide for a throughput of students into tertiary education and help them to become the best engineers, technologists, mathematicians and scientists that the country has to offer.  The point that I am making is that the SFI has other areas of opportunity outside of the prioritisation exercise. We have just announced funding of €6.9 million for basic research with the potential for entrepreneurial activity to support basic scientific researchers in areas such as health. In that sector it will enable us to research whether there are economical or societal impacts. SFI core funding will be invested into that type of an endeavour.  SFI is not just concerned with prioritisation in the 14 areas. It is involved in a raft of other activities and one shall not be at the expense of the other. In other words, prioritisation is not applied at the expense of basic research and both aspects will continue together.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:20:00+01:00	I shall respond in general terms. I have always contended that science research and innovation is an apolitical space. With regard to the amendment, I ask that we debate the matter on Report Stage. I am openly disposed to accepting it as it would give the Houses of the Oireachtas a better opportunity to interrogate relevant issues, and I do not mean that in a loaded fashion. It would derogate how the role of SFI translates in terms of its operational structures and programmes and its impact from a societal and economic point of view. Even SFI, as an entity, would welcome that opportunity.Consequently, I am favourably disposed and ask the Deputy to allow me to return to the matter on Report Stage. I will try to deal with it then.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	For the same reasons I outlined in respect of amendments Nos. 10 and 11, there is a danger inherent within the amendment that too short a view might be taken. At the time of SFI's establishment, it was generally recognised that the research it began to fund in 2000 would not generate the desired outcomes or impact for a horizon spanning perhaps ten to 15 years and we have not yet even reached that stage. It is important to have perspective and I acknowledge the Deputy's point regarding the opportunity it presents to highlight the value of research and so on. However, if one is to account for every single cent or euro that is spent and if one seeks to put in place an appraisal mechanism around that, is one then in danger of creating huge bureaucracies or administrative functions that are unserviceable precisely for the reasons I outlined previously? For instance, under the new opportunities that will arise under Horizon 2020, the foreign direct investment landscape mentioned by the Deputy will, while working with the research landscape in Ireland, retain jobs. However, we can now use the investment made of €300 million as leverage to create further opportunities during the lifetime of the next framework programme, because we believe we can ramp up that activity and surpass the €600 million target under the current framework. If one were obliged to create an administrative function to drill down into that to the last cent, I do not know whether one would be able to achieve that goal. I do not know of any research landscape in the world, even the most highly evolved, that would be able to achieve it. For instance, if one takes the Fraunhofer model, that is, the funding cost model that exists at present under FP7, there is a certain resistance by some larger research institutions against the simplification model the member states are trying to establish. This is because it suits them as they can fund administrative models that allow them to get greater leverage from European Union funding calls. Consequently, while I understand the sentiment behind the amendment, I believe it is far too prescriptive. Its timelines are too short and were members able to develop a mechanism here whereby this matter was being debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas or was at least discussed in a formalised and structured way, they could drill down into such debates and arguments. In that sense, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. Title agreed to.
