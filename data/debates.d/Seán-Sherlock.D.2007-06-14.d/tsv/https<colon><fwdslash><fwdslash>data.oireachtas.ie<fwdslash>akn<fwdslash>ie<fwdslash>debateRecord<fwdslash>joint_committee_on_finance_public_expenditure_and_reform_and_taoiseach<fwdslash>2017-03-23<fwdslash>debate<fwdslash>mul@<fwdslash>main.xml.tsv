[<p eid="para_25">Mr. Carville described credit unions as diverse and stated their mode of operation presents challenges in that there are 283 different boards and entities. He also referred to the need for flexibility and proportionality in policy and regulation to support the credit union framework. Does this involve having a process of tiered regulation and, if so, when will such a process be in place?</p>]
[<p eid="para_27">I ask Mr. Carville to provide brief, concise answers because I have only a short time to question him.</p>]
[<p eid="para_29">I would prefer the view of the Department of Finance. The credit union representative organisations appeared before the joint committee on Tuesday last. Tiered regulation does not appear to feature in the model being pursued from a policy perspective, that is, by the Department, or by the Central Bank. According to one school of thought, a rural credit union cannot be assessed in the same way as an industrial credit union, to use Mr. Carville's term, or any other type of sectoral credit union. Members need to find out whether there will be movement towards tiered regulation. The question requires a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">When will it report?</p>]
[<p eid="para_33">I am failing to grasp something here. We all offer platitudes on the importance of the credit union sector. How long has the CUAC report been in existence?</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">Time is passing. We need a definitive answer as to when tiered regulation will take place. Mr. Carville says the implementation group is meeting. Can we have an expectation that it will be in the first, second, third or fourth quarter in 2017 or the first quarter in 2018? We need definitive timelines.</p>]
[<p eid="para_37">The Department will have oversight of that process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_42">This is what I do not understand. As parliamentarians, we are aware of the restructuring that has taken place because it has happened within our communities. However, there was a clear message on Tuesday that the regulation does not reflect the reality. The witness says that once the ReBo process is completed, the tiered regulation will follow, if I interpret her correctly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_44">What does business model development mean from the Department's perspective? I ask the witness to give me definitive answers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_48">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">What is the Department of Finance's position on that, given that there is a clear programme for Government commitment around social housing and there has been engagement with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on including the credit union movement? Why has that not moved on?</p>]
[<p eid="para_52">The credit union representatives told us on Tuesday that they have been going around in circles. I am sure the witnesses have read what they said.</p>]
[<p eid="para_54">The witness sits on the implementation committee and I am trying to understand the position of the Department of Finance. What is its position regarding the potential of the credit union movement, which is sitting on a myriad of assets? Many of the credit unions have restructured already, so please do not tell us that there is a further process to be undertaken. The bulk of the larger credit unions are sitting on massive reserves and have potential. They say they are going around in circles to Departments and the regulator but nothing is moving on this matter. Why is that the case? Is it the case that the Department and the Central Bank are taking a view that they do not want the credit union movement to move into these spaces? I hear words such as "innovation". I was formerly a Minister of State with responsibility for innovation. What does it mean? What does business model development mean? Many credit unions have moved into smart payments and so forth. They are trying to innovate in the products and services they are providing, but it appears that they are constrained in doing that. I cannot understand why and I am not getting answers here either.</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">The witness is telling me that I have to ask these questions of the Central Bank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_58">What is the current state of the €250 million restructuring fund and the €250 million resolution fund?</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">On Tuesday, the league of credit unions raised the over-collection of levies. How does the witness respond to its assertion that there is an over-collection of levies?</p>]
[<p eid="para_62">If any party refuses to implement any element of the commission report, will the Department report that refusal to this committee and to the Minister?</p>]
[<p eid="para_64">I mean any party that is a party to that, including the Central Bank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_66">Does the witness agree with the assertion that CUAC has identified elements of the commission report that are outstanding? If he agrees with that assertion and if those elements of the commission report that are outstanding have not been implemented, what happens?</p>]
[<p eid="para_68">Mr. Carville is part of the implementation team.</p>]
[<p eid="para_70">What will the Department do if parts of the CUAC report are not implemented?</p>]
[<p eid="para_72">That is not a hypothetical question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">This committee is in something of a vacuum. We want to hear what the stakeholders have to say and we want to ensure that there is a vibrant credit union movement into the future. I am not convinced that a sunset is being put on actions or key deliverables within definitive and clearly defined timelines. It seems from what Mr. Carville is saying that the Department is not a million miles away from understanding the needs of the credit union movement and realising the potential of the movement. However, there is still a logjam. This is why we are trying to go hard on the questioning here. I suggest that tiered regulation is the nut that needs to be cracked.</p>, <p eid="para_75"> The impression I get from the engagement of the Department and the Central Bank with the credit union movement is that one of them, or both, does not want to be dealing with 283 entities. I think there is a certain attitude that regards the credit unions as somehow amateurish because they are voluntary and non-paid. All credit unions have gone through the rigours in recent months. Some of them have spent hundreds of thousands of euro from members' money on consultancy fees to meet the needs and requirements of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. They are not seeing light at the end of the tunnel. They need to see that happening. That is why I am asking about clearly defined timelines for the full implementation of the CUAC recommendations. We are depending on the Department of Finance as a stakeholder in that process. If we do not see progress in this respect within clearly defined timelines, that will not bode well for our confidence in the Department of Finance or the Central Bank. I hope that makes sense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_77">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">Do the witnesses understand the frustration of the credit unions about the lack of progress?</p>]
[<p eid="para_85">I thank Mr. Carville.</p>]
[<p eid="para_168">I support what the Chairman says about Mr. Corr. In Mr. Carville's presentation he stated that the credit union policy within his division is well resourced and is headed by Brian Corr. If the head of the credit union policy team cannot be here today in this Parliament and feels that Brussels is of greater importance that is a bad day for our interactions with the Department</p>]
[<p eid="para_278">I wish to support that statement if I may. At the start of the crisis, we were informed there was a €1 billion hole in the credit unions. The Department now informs us the sum involved is €500 million, consisting of €250 million related to restructuring and a further €250 million related to resolution. Of the €250 million provided for one of these two purposes, only €20 million was used as bail-out money. I use that term for the sake of argument. This means the extent of the crisis in the credit union movement was grossly exaggerated. If only €20 million of a €250 million fund has been required, the amount needed has been minuscule when compared with what was needed for the banks. It is certainly minuscule relative to the €1 billion we were informed would be needed for restructuring.</p>, <p eid="para_279"> The credit unions are now being levied to generate funding for an unspecified purpose. It does not seem to be for any particular reason because two separate funds, each of €250 million, are already in place. This is akin to imposing a highway tax on the credit unions. Will the witnesses explain the reason for this in simple language, please?</p>]
[<p eid="para_281">Will the credit unions have their money returned to them?</p>]
[<p eid="para_283">Put another way, will the money be returned to us because we are all credit union customers?</p>]
[<p eid="para_285">This is taxpayers' money.</p>]
[<p eid="para_291">There is a restructuring fund and resolution fund in place.</p>]
[<p eid="para_314">Mr. Carville should not try to stretch his credibility on this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_322">They took the money.</p>]
[<p eid="para_325">May we have an update in the next quarter on the work of the implementation group? I suggest we send a message to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank that the committee will monitor the work of the bank very closely on behalf of the people we represent. We need clear, identifiable timelines and deadlines because progress has slipped. Contrary to what Mr. Carville said, tiered regulation was defined in the original commission's report. There were to be three processes for tiered regulation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_327">I do not understand why we have not moved from that point to having tiered regulation under way at this stage in the first quarter of 2017. Many credit unions have done the necessary hard graft and paid thousands of euro in consultancy fees to go through the process. The hub and spoke model was developed in which the bigger entities took on the smaller ones. We have a lot of work to do to ensure there will be a proper throughput in a clearly defined timeline.</p>]
[<p eid="para_421">How many staff does Ms McKiernan have in her office?</p>]
[<p eid="para_423">Some 70 staff. How many people interface with the individual credit unions on a daily basis?</p>]
[<p eid="para_425">That is 35 staff dealing with 281 credit unions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_427">I thank Ms McKiernan. That is fine.</p>]
[<p eid="para_429">How would Ms McKiernan describe the nature of the relationship between her staff and individual credit unions on a day-to-day basis? Would she describe it as professional and courteous?</p>]
[<p eid="para_431">Are there times when voices are raised between her staff and individual staff members of credit unions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_433">Have there been occasions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_435">Going back to the regulation-making powers, Ms McKiernan spoke about the broad class of investments and the upcoming consultation. She also referred to expectations in respect of developing new business models. During our engagements on Tuesday, we heard from credit unions that they are undertaking digital and social media based marketing on a shared basis and that they are generating new business successfully.</p>, <p eid="para_436">We have heard about a shared approach to the mortgage support framework, notwithstanding the views articulated today. My understanding is the bodies do this without necessarily engaging with the Central Bank. How prescriptive does Ms McKiernan see the bank's role in the development of new business models? She indicated that the bank had a vision of a particular business model started in 2014 but which did not progress in 2017. I am trying to gain an understanding of the culture within the bank's organisation; it is quite difficult to understand it. She should correct me if I am wrong, but it seems that if I was to come to the bank with something I deem to be progressive for a credit union, it would state it would fly or it would not. It is a case of "Yes" or "No". Am I right in discerning that the bank will not come up with a business model or ideas for how something should progress? What is the process involved? Is it iterative or interactive? Does the bank engage positively? It seems that if an idea does not fly, that is it and a credit union must go back to the drawing board. I want to understand the Central Bank's powers in developing new business models and how deep is the engagement. How prescriptive is the bank in developing new business models?</p>]
[<p eid="para_438">As I have a short amount of time, can we keep the answers short, if that is okay? </p>, <p eid="para_439"> If I were to come to the Central Bank with a proposal, it would kick the tyres, but it might not necessarily come back to me saying it could be tinkered with here or there. Its role, remit and power are very clear when it comes to new proposals.</p>]
[<p eid="para_441">I appreciate that. The delegates have indicated that standards of regulatory compliance are still well below those required to credibly safeguard members' funds and position credit unions to tackle business model development. They are still seeing an unacceptable number of credit unions failing to display a strategic understanding and good governance. In several cases we have encountered limited financial skill sets and weak management. There are 281 credit unions within the Central Bank's remit, but how many are still weak in terms of having limited financial skills and weak management. I would like a specific number.</p>]
[<p eid="para_443">That was said in an earlier intervention, but I need numbers. Are there "several" outliers? Do they amount to a very small minority, less than 10 or 20 of the 281 credit unions? One could easily create the impression that this refers to the majority rather than being the exception. I need to have an understanding of how many are still behind the door in getting their governance procedures correct. We all understand credit unions went through a very difficult restructuring process. The hub and spoke model was developed and it is probably an iterative and ongoing process. They spent thousands of euro on consultant fees. Would Ms McKiernan agree that many credit unions have come through that process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_445">Indeed, but I am trying to understand how many still have a way to go in ensuring risk management, compliance and internal audit functions are robust.</p>]
[<p eid="para_447">If the number is at the "higher end", Ms McKiernan should have a figure in her mind.</p>]
[<p eid="para_449">What is the number today, 23 March?</p>]
[<p eid="para_451">Ms McKiernan has already said that three times and does not need to repeat the point. I want to come to the issue of tiered regulation. We are being told that there is no tiered regulation, but if I understand the language used by Ms McKiernan today, she is telling us in couched terms - she can correct me if I am wrong - that there is tiered regulation in everything but name. Is that correct?</p>]
[<p eid="para_453">Let us not couch our language. As politicians, we are used to couched language. Is Ms McKiernan saying there is <i>de facto</i> tiering?</p>]
[<p eid="para_455">Ms McKiernan has indicated that the bank has seen "no investigations of short-term or medium-term lending proposals." When did it become necessary for a credit union to obtain the registrar's permission for such proposals?</p>]
[<p eid="para_457">Ms McKiernan has also stated the Central Bank has undertaken to publish enhanced guidance on what it expects to see in terms of long-term proposals. Are the guidelines inadequate or fit for purpose?</p>]
[<p eid="para_460">In respect of sectoral leadership, if I was reading that as a CUDA, CUMA or ILCU member and if Ms McKiernan was telling me that there is a need, in her own words, for greater sectoral leadership and a fuller understanding of risks involved to develop a roadmap of business model development, I might take issue with that. In respect of our interactions with the sector on Tuesday, there was consistency in its approach with no outliers. CUMA, CUDA and ILCU were represented. They would argue that they are showing leadership and that they are more than willing to engage. The Chairman has used the merry-go-round analogy. They have been on the merry-go-round with the Department of Finance and they contend with the Central Bank as well to show the type of leadership and develop the innovation and business models Ms McKiernan is speaking about here, but there still seems to be a resistance to that. It would be my contention that by any objective analysis, they have shown leadership because they have gone through the rigours of restructuring and, with some outliers, have adhered to the restructuring process as regulated by the Registrar of Credit Unions.</p>, <p eid="para_461"> To use Ms McKiernan's language, they now want to move into that multi-step of developing the sector again, growing the business model and encouraging new lending with a younger demographic of borrowers. It seems that neither they nor Ms McKiernan are a million miles apart but there is something within the chasm and vacuum that needs to be unblocked. I do not know if it is an issue of perception regarding how the Central Bank perceives the sector and how the sector perceives the Central Bank. Somebody needs to do a bit of mediation because if I listen to Ms McKiernan and the intervention of the representative bodies, I can see that they all want to go in the same direction but there is some blockage in the way that needs to be worked through because they have already gone through the rigours of the regulatory process.</p>, <p eid="para_462"> I know Ms McKiernan is not paying lip service to the idea of recognising the importance of the sector, but there is some responsibility on the part of the Central Bank to ensure the sector progresses back into productive lending sooner rather than later because this has been going on too long. The Credit Union Advisory Committee report has been in existence for a while and the implementation group only met in the first quarter of this year so we need to see progress by the second or third quarter because we have already told the Department of Finance that we want it to appear again before this committee. I hope the Central Bank would appear before the committee as soon as possible to see what progress is being made on these issues.</p>]
[<p eid="para_465">Not all 281 common bond credit unions will come to the Registrar of Credit Unions with a set of proposals. They will work their way up through their representative organisations. I presume the articulation of development of new business will be done primarily through the representative bodies, with which Ms McKiernan engages regularly. If I understand it correctly, in a nutshell, Ms McKiernan is telling me that more work needs to be done on the business model development piece.</p>]
