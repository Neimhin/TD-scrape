[<p eid="para_42">I also welcome the departmental officials.  I will pose some brief questions to begin with.</p>, <p eid="para_43">How does the Department see the market for milk evolving post-2015?  We are talking about an increase in quotas up to 2015, although there is a strong view emanating from producers within the sector that there should be no further increases.  I would like to hear the Department's response to this view.</p>, <p eid="para_44">As regards the post-2015 scenario, does the Department envisage that there will be far fewer milk producers?  Will there be a greater consolidation of farm holdings as a result?  Will we follow the UK model which, arguably, is not necessarily the best one?  There is a certain critique into which I will not delve.</p>, <p eid="para_45">On modulation, a movement of funding from pillar 1 to pillar 2 would be significant.  There is a lack of clarity on who would control the spend.  If it is envisaged that some of this spend would be encompassed by the rural development programme, does this mean that the Department would no longer have control of it?  Would it be under the control of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?  If that is the case, certain issues would arise.  Will our guests clarify the position on the Department's thinking in respect of that process?</p>, <p eid="para_46">I will await a response to the points I have raised and proceed from there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_59">What does Mr. O'Driscoll mean by the term "effective market management measures", which he has used three or four times?</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">What schemes?</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">May I ask a brief question, as we do not get this opportunity too often?  On the modulation issue with regard to the rural development schemes there is a perception that an income could be derived by a farmer <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new challenges that are spoken about — climate change, bio-energy, water management and biodiversity.  In terms of management of the countryside, if I may use that euphemism, will that be taken from them as a source of income effectively and be put into Leader groups, rural development committees and organisations, where it could find its way into a black hole?  I am seeking to get a guarantee about modulation and management of the countryside.  Some assurance must be given to those who are involved in the sector that they will not lose an income stream and that it will not go into that so-called black hole of rural development.</p>]
[<p eid="para_113">This is important.</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">Is there discretion in that regard?</p>]
[<p eid="para_174">The political wind is blowing against the ICMSA's position on milk quotas.  However, I am glad we have heard an alternative view.  How realistic is it to have adopted at the Council of Ministers a proposal that would result in the increasing of quotas or the maintenance of quotas after 2015?  Can the floor price for milk be sustained if the Council of Ministers and CAP health check proposals are accepted as envisaged?  In the context of opening the market, can a floor milk price be maintained both in the shorter term prior to final implementation of the proposals and in the longer term?</p>]
