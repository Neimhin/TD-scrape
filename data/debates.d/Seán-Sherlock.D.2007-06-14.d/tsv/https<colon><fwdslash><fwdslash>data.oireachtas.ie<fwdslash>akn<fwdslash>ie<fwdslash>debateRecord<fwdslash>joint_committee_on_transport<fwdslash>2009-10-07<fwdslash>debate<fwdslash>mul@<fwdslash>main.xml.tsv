[<p eid="para_142">I will be brief.  I apologise for missing the beginning of the presentation.  Along with Deputy Broughan, who sends his apologies, I have already met Mr. Roche and Mr. Bonham.  As a representative of a rural constituency that has seen the benefits of this programme, I would like to restate the Labour Party's support for it.  The intergenerational solidarity that existed when people lived in tighter and smaller communities has diminished over the years as people have dispersed.  Many older people who reside on their own are unable to drive or have stopped driving over recent years — their children may have flown the nest to live in Dublin and other far-flung places — and therefore depend on rural transport services.</p>, <p eid="para_143">If one considers this matter rationally, it is clear that the budgetary provision of €11 million that has been made is no more than a drop in the ocean in the grand scheme of things.  One of the benefits of the existence of the rural transport scheme is the social solidarity it engenders.  I had the good fortune to travel on the Blackwater-Avondhu service last Thursday morning, in the company of a bunch of the finest people one is ever likely to meet.  Such country people, who are the salt of the earth, could be described as our own people.  They benefit from their interaction with similar people as they access services which they would not have been able to access before now.  Common sense says that it is practical and worthwhile to defend such services.</p>, <p eid="para_144">As someone with a background in economics, I am aware that it is sometimes called "the dismal science".  I suppose there is a sense in which economists apply a certain rationale to how things are done.  They sometimes extract the human benefit from that rationale.  I suggest that the production of the McCarthy report was a very academic exercise, which did not take account of the need to protect our strong rural population and provide the services that are needed in rural areas.  The diminution of services advocated in the report must be fought at a political level.  I am here to support that fight.</p>]
