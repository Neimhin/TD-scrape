SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	By legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the Minister's response, but I ask him to forgive me if I missed something in his reply.  Will the Government achieve a target of 10,000 ha. this year: yes or no?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to consider the matter from two perspectives.  Would the Minister of State acknowledge that ensuring the target is met would potentially capture in the private forestry sector up to 160,000 tonnes of CO2?  According to the private forestry sector, if the State were to purchase carbon credits for that amount, it would cost approximately €46 million.  While the 10,000 hectares is an aspirational figure, would the Minister of State acknowledge that we should move beyond aspirations at this stage?  There is a clear need in a very productive sector to ensure that the investment will yield a multiplier of the benefits in the longer term.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister mentioned that the average payment per person will be €4,000 per annum, which is below the €5,000 maximum.  To what does he attribute this figure?What is the up to date position regarding those who are leaving REPS 3?  Will they be accommodated under the AEOS next year?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Speaking of the Estimates, is the Minister confident he can secure the €50 million next year, or more, depending on the demand for the scheme?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We have all been lobbied by the IFA this week and this is one of the issues that has arisen.  If we take the Deputy's point about the Food Harvest 2020 report, would the Minister acknowledge that one criticism of the document, which we support, is that if we are to achieve those targets, particularly in the dairy sector, there must be a major restructuring in the use of land and stock?  To incentivise new blood into the sector, the reliefs must be continued and extended.  Does the Minister agree with that point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	All parties welcome the Food Harvest 2020 report.  Will the Minister acknowledge, however, that the implementation body's membership is not wide enough?  Will he agree he should have included representatives from this side of the House as we represent a significant proportion of the population?  Will the Minister guarantee the €641 million allocated to the agrifood research and development programme will be maintained to achieve this policy?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the Minister's commitment to flexibility in the implementation process.  However, the Labour Party believes it needs to be widened.  Will the Minister consider engaging with parties on this side of the House to achieve this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I fail to see how our membership of the European Union has a bearing on this question.  Will the Minister provide some direction as to when a statutory code of conduct will be put in place?  When will this happen?  We seek a specific time and date.  Will the Minister not acknowledge there is a certain irony in the fact that the Minister of State sitting beside him, Deputy Cuffe, has referred to Terra Madre and the Slow Food movement, which comprises small organic producers who seek to find an export market?  Meanwhile, in this country, the Government is capitulating to the Tescos and Asdas of this world which seek to gain a foothold here.  Will the Minister confirm that he will do everything in his power to ensure that the retail planning guidelines will not be moved or shifted in any way to facilitate the "Tescoification" of the Irish grocery sector and to ensure that we can protect the primary producers to whom the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, referred such that we retain a good mix and not do not sell ourselves out to the large multiples?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With all due respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Government should put its money where its mouth is.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister is well aware that it is knocking on the door.  If he is not aware of this, he should be.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I raise this matter in the context of the fact that €300 million is spent annually in Cork on prefabricated buildings in the primary school sector.  Today, we learned through RTE that €330 million of the budget of the Department of Education and Skills has not yet been spent.  I use the particular example of Midleton because three primary schools are housed in inadequate conditions.  I put the question to the Minister about the educational needs of Midleton in the future and the answer stated: "School accommodation requirements in the Midleton/Carrigtwohill area have been considered as part of this detailed study of the identified areas, which indicates that up 38 additional primary classrooms may be required across that area to cater for increased enrolments up to the school year 2014/15."  There are three schools in the area — St. John the Baptist national school, an Educate Together school and a gaelscoil.  I am sure the Minister's response will point out the Department has applied for planning permission at Ballinacurra, a site that would be woefully inadequate for meeting the longer-term needs of primary schools in Midleton.  The Educate Together school is housed in the local rugby club at a cost of €45,000 per year.  The gaelscoil is spending approximately €81,000 on rental costs and is being housed in the local community centre.  I do not have the figures for the third school.  If we take a lateral approach about how to provide this, we can make savings in the long run.  We want the Department to come down and make a proper study and assessment of the educational requirements in the Midleton area so that it can adhere to the aim to meet the need for 38 additional primary school classrooms and adhere to the various ethos that exist.St. John the Baptist national school is largely a Church of Ireland denomination school.  Along with the Educate Together school and the gaelscoil, it could be housed on one campus, but the Ballinacurra site is woefully inadequate.  Something must be done.  In the case of St. John the Baptist national school, the school authorities have an imaginative plan and have sought a loan from the Department in order to carry out the work.  It has proven it can do this work in the past.  If the Department got out of its centralised, structuralised tendency to think along the same lines, these people could achieve their aims.  They seek a little help from the Government in order to do so.  Similarly, the Educate Together school is housed in the local rugby club and was offered a site at the local co-op, which it could rent at a significantly lower price than the Department is paying at present.  Why do we not think laterally about how we can help them?Midleton is a barometer for many towns beyond the Pale.  I asked the Department and the Minister to take on board the submissions made by the schools and to recognise the deficiencies at the Ballinacurra site.  I call on someone to please meet with these people and think a little more laterally about how they are going to deliver for educational needs in the primary sector in the future.
