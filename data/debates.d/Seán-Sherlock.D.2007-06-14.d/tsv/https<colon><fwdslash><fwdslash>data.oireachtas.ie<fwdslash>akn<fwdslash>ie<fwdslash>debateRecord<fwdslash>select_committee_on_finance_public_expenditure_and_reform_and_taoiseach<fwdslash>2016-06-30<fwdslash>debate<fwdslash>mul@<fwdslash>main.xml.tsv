[<p eid="para_48">I, too, welcome the Ministers. My question also relates to Brexit. From his wisdom and experience, what does the Minister see as the potential impact of Brexit on foreign direct investment in this country? The programme for Government has clear targets for job creation over the lifetime of the Governmentâ€™s mandate. If the UK tax position becomes more competitive, particularly regarding financial services and the lowering of VAT rates or even corporation tax rates, does the Minister have a sense of the potential impact that will have on job creation in this country, as well as the ability to attract foreign direct investment?</p>, <p eid="para_49"> While there might be an early boost of foreign direct investment into Ireland, the UK still remains the largest attractor of foreign direct investment in Europe. In the context of the financial services sector, there is a concern that Ireland may not be sufficiently diversified in access to markets and exports of financial services. Is there an over-reliance on exports of financial services to the UK? Has there been a significant diversification of exports to the Asian and North American markets?</p>, <p eid="para_50"> The Minister stated that there are still 85,998 mortgage accounts in arrears. While this represents an 18% decline, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to examine further measures to support borrowers. Have any of those measures been advanced at this juncture?</p>]
[<p eid="para_62">My question was in respect of financial services and the IFSC. Let us suppose the UK departs from EU taxation legislation or case law in respect of VAT. Is the financial services sector in this country sufficiently diversified such that there is no over-reliance on the UK market? I have in mind exports of financial goods and services, the financial technology industry and everything that sails in that ship. This includes exports of services from Ireland to the UK. Have we diversified sufficiently into Asian markets, EU markets and North American markets? That is really the question.</p>, <p eid="para_63"> Is there contingency planning in place? I am asking the question insofar as it is possible because we are in a state of flux politically and economically and it is impossible to predict what is going to happen in terms of the effect on the Irish economy, the UK economy and the European economy no matter how much contingency planning we put in place. All we can do is go by the ESRI and the Department of Finance predictors in so far as that is possible.</p>, <p eid="para_64"> Can I get a sense from the Department of Finance or the Government of whether there is contingency planning under way? Is the Department seeking to ensure that the gains made by the financial services sector will not be lost and that we will continue to grow? That is an important message and signal.</p>]
[<p eid="para_282">I welcome the Taoiseach to the committee. I will start with the Vote. I acknowledge the role of everybody involved in the 1916 commemorations. I know this was a cross-party initiative led by the Taoiseach's Department. We must acknowledge the inclusivity of the programmes and the fact that the occasion was participated in by communities right across the country. It is a programme of which everybody can be very proud. When will the citizens' assembly be established? There is provision for it in the Estimate, but will it still meet the October timeline?</p>, <p eid="para_283"> The Cabinet committee on rural and regional affairs deals with rural development, broadband and flooding. I know it has a particular eye on the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM. I hope to get a signal from the Taoiseach that this is not just a talking shop and that the Cabinet committee has a budget line with real actions around it. Will the Taoiseach provide an insight on that?</p>, <p eid="para_284"> Will I start with that opening gambit and come back with a few more?</p>]
[<p eid="para_288">I will make a political point about the citizens' assembly. We are in a citizens' assembly. Notwithstanding the Government's decision, we have received a mandate from the people regarding governance and decisions, so we are well equipped by virtue of that mandate - and its diversity - to deal with the issue.</p>, <p eid="para_289"> I am worried about the number of Irish personnel serving in EU and international institutions. I know there is a specific job to be done and the Department is working on that. When the United Kingdom exits the European Union, the number of staff with English as a first language will decrease significantly, so there is scope for Irish people to take up the slack. I hope we will be strategic in that respect.</p>, <p eid="para_290"> Are all the case files in the Chief State Solicitor's Office being managed and is it being done in a timely fashion? Is there much of a backlog in the office and are enough resources being allocated there?</p>, <p eid="para_291"> I am very conscious of the time but I will speak about Brexit. I do not know why Mr. Tusk refused to meet the Scottish First Minister. I recognise some concerns were raised by the Spanish Prime Minister, who is a member of the European People's Party, of which the Taoiseach's party is also a member. There may have been some issues relating to how Scotland is not recognised as a state but rather as a region. One can consider the political issue of Brexit and that Northern Ireland voted overwhelmingly to stay within the European Union, as did Scotland. The question did not arise for Ireland. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is an avowed Brexiteer and the First Minister of Northern Ireland has a very explicit position on the UK's membership of the European Union. That presents a serious challenge for us, particularly in ensuring there is a negotiated position that does not leave us weakened economically as a result of the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. I wish the Taoiseach well in the coming months with the economic diplomacy that will have to be gone through, as well as the political diplomacy. Anglo-Irish relations have never been as good as they are now, arguably, and I would like to get a sense from the Taoiseach now or in future as to how we will address the political conundrum of ensuring that once there is a new British Prime Minister we can up the ante in that diplomatic onslaught. At this stage I acknowledge the role of our ambassador in the United Kingdom, Mr. Dan Mulhall, as well as the role of the consulate in Edinburgh in ensuring we did everything we could to encourage Irish people in the United Kingdom to vote on the referendum. In future there should be a mechanism to ensure the terms of trade are enhanced and we do not become disadvantaged due to the potential of the United Kingdom to lower its corporation tax and VAT rates, for example, making us even less competitive for inward investment. It is a political point but I want to put it on record.</p>]
[<p eid="para_297">If I could get a note on that, I would be happy.</p>]
[<p eid="para_299">I thank the Taoiseach.</p>]
