SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am trying to read between the lines and interpret the Minister of State's speech after just one hearing.  If I am not mistaken, this is a glaring admission that the Government has no power to change the labelling regime because the European Commission argues that unless rules are harmonised throughout the EU as a whole, no changes can occur and national legislation would create a barrier to trade and potentially impinge on the Single Market rules.  That is my interpretation of the Minister of State's remarks.We are in situation where the issue of substantial transformation — if I interpret the Minister of State's speech correctly — will not now be dealt with as an urgent matter in the immediate future.  The question arises whether there will be a labelling regime that will give comfort to those who have purchased products, who want to know whether the product has been substantially transformed and whether the label will state as much.  If I interpret correctly the Minister of State's contribution to the committee today, I would say no such legislation is forthcoming.What was the timeline, choreography or chronology of the interaction between the Minister of State and the Commission or the between the Government and the Commission?  I understand that on 25 June last, the Irish authorities re-notified the draft regulations which were not accepted by the Commission on 12 March.  I want to know what transpired between 12 March, 25 June and today.Is there a provision that allows for labelling to be made clearer and can one get around the rules of the European Union framework that would allow one to say whether a product has been substantially transformed?  A significant proportion of the food industry in Ireland substantially transforms its product.  There could be a significant reduction in that market if consumers were to have full facts on the products they purchase daily and were to know the product had been substantially transformed in any way.  That would have a negative impact on the market.If one is going to substantially transform something, one should tell people it is to be substantially transformed and let the consumer decide.  If I want to buy something that is substantially transformed such as a packet of rashers or another meat product, if I happen to like that product, I will buy it anyway but if I have information on whether it has been substantially transformed, at least that will assist me in my purchasing decision.  However, there is no regulation or policing of the packaging regime.The Minister of State is saying frankly that the new legislation will not be in place for a couple of years and that even at that stage, if I am interpreting it correctly, it will be on the basis of each member state producing, of its own volition, a mandatory indication.  If that is to happen in a few years, why is it not happening now?  That is the big question.  It seems from the Minister of State's contribution that things will not change.  Anyone who has concerns about the issue of substantial transformation, or the labelling regime as a whole, will not be provided with any comfort from the Minister of State's statement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked about the timeline, between March when the Commission gave its negative opinion and when the Irish authorities re-notified the Commission as to its position, and where we stand today.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am not satisfied.  I accept what the Minister of State said about the moves taking place at present but what the people want to know, and what I would like to know, is whether there is sufficient political willingness to address this issue head on.  My view is that there is not.  I believe the Commission and the other member states will kick this matter to touch for another while and we might be back here in three years time with no movement on it.  That is why I wonder about the timelines so far.  Why did the Government go through the process if we are now at a stage where there will ultimately be a new regime anyway?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are working on the basis of something that I assume is in the programme for Government, and on the basis of a commitment by the Government.  That is the basis on which we ask these questions.  It might be wise and might be the most honest thing if the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, were to state publicly that the labelling regime in this country will not now be changed and that the Government must go through more rí-rá agus ruaille-buaille, as the Minister of State so described it, with the member states, and that there will be no outcome for a number of years.  That might perhaps be the most honest public statement to make on the issue, as a bridging statement to address the concerns of——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——people who are worried about food labelling.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We do not have laurels to sit on because the Government has done nothing about this issue for the past year.
