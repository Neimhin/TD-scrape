SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:10:00+00:00	I thank the representatives for their attendance. The motivation for asking them to appear was to gain an understanding of the dynamics within and between HIQA and Tusla. I am trying to understand the dynamic that exists in terms of the regulation of social workers. CORU is the regulatory body for registration and so on. However, I do not have an understanding of the dynamic that exists between HIQA and, for example, the social care or social work framework. HIQA may have, for example, 14 inspectors operating across the country. Its opening statement states:Tusla cannot rely on recurring staff shortages as the default reason for failing to deliver an efficient and safe service to children and their families. Nor can they use this as an excuse for not providing an environment where social workers and social care workers can enjoy doing the core job they are qualified to do.Is that statement based on a determination or examination of the dynamic that exists as between the client or service user and the social worker? Does that mean that HIQA's 14 inspectors speak to each social worker throughout the country in order to allow that adjudication to be made? How does HIQA determine the level or quality of contact time? How does it determine the level of bureaucracy and paperwork? Can it manage that time? Can it measure the time social workers spend in contact with their clients and the time they spend on paperwork? Does HIQA go down to that level of granularity?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:10:00+00:00	I wish to be sure that I understand correctly. The statutory investigation shone a light on the processes. The standard operating procedures and protocols were offered up to HIQA and it could determine from that how the overall organisation was operating.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:10:00+00:00	Is adherence a systematic issue within Tusla?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:10:00+00:00	HIQA interacts with the Department on that group. What is the current rate of progress on those issues?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:10:00+00:00	The natural instinct of committee members is to empathise with social care workers and social workers. Our limited interaction with them through our constituency offices indicates that caseload is a significant factor for them. If there is a finite number of social workers and social care workers and the rate of attrition is high, one can reasonably extrapolate that the number of cases each worker must manage is increasing. I would contend that there are not enough hours in the day for them to deal with every case from a time management point of view. There must be some sympathy for the position in which they find themselves, notwithstanding the immediacy of the need of the child or family. Are social care workers and social workers now being put through the ringer? The statutory investigation was very challenging in terms of its conclusions and was instigated in the wider context of a tribunal. Are Tusla staff now subject to a higher level of bureaucracy that is challenging their ability to deliver for the people they serve and putting them under even more pressure?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	To give some of the context, we all understand very well how HIQA operates. We know, for instance, what it does in tertiary hospitals in measuring bed spaces and processes within acute hospital settings. However, should it be so strident within social care settings in human contact between a social worker and the client and his or her family? As stated, I know that it is not possible to compromise in dealing with risk, but we need to give them a bit of a break and recognise that they find themselves under massive pressure. I do not think it is fair to state "nor can [Tusla] use this as an excuse for not providing an environment where social workers and social care workers can enjoy doing the core job they are qualified to do." Ms Dunnion can correct me if I am wrong, but social workers and social care workers might not be able to do the job they are qualified to do because they do not have the toolkit to do it and their caseload is getting heavier. Therefore, the risks also increase, which is not necessarily always the fault of the social worker. I am fearful that we could be putting the blame on the head of the social worker or the social care worker. That is my key point. I ask Ms Dunnion to dissuade me in holding that view.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	I appreciate that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	I thank Ms Dunnion for that answer. I have one final question. I want to understand the dynamic in the relationship between HIQA and the institutes of higher education. HIQA has made specific recommendations on the need for more graduates, etc. Does it have a statutory role in determining that dynamic? Does it have influence in leaning on Tusla and the Department to be able to suggest that if certain courses of action are taken, certain programmes are created or there is engagement with a particular institution, more places could be created to meet the shortages? I understand HIQA can make recommendations, but is that all it can do? Does it have any power to follow through on them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	That is fair enough.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	On the review of best practice, HIQA made a recommendation that an international review of best practice be undertaken. How stands that recommendation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T10:20:00+00:00	I thank Ms Dunnion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	I apologise in advance as I am under time constraints and will have to leave the meeting. Some of us have questions to the Minister, who is in the Chamber so I will not delay. I thank the witnesses for coming. Tusla's statement is very clear in that it sets out pathways and challenges. I welcome this and acknowledge the recruitment and retention challenges Tusla faces. I also acknowledge the challenges it faces in respect of the HIQA reports and investigation and the outworkings of that. The expert assurance group, EAG, which was established to oversee and advise on the implementation of the recommendations of HIQA's investigation, has published its first quarterly report. Will the witnesses give me a sense of how this is working for them at present?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Does there continue to be a structured engagement with HIQA?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	How often does that take place? Does it take place through the expert assurance group?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	I ask Mr. Smyth to talk to me about Tusla's whole-time equivalents. The number of staff has reached 3,893.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Of those, 1,453 are involved in social work or social care.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Is this increase a result of the recruitment drive?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Tusla has 499 agency staff.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Of those, 226 are social workers and 160 are in social care.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	How much is this costing Tusla, quarterly or annually?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	That is obviously a substantial cost.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	What is Mr. Smyth doing to shift that dynamic in order that Tusla can recruit these people as whole-time equivalents?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	If I were an agency worker, why would I want to go into Tusla? Is it more beneficial in terms of my terms and conditions and rate of pay to stay as an agency worker?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Is Mr. Smyth trying proactively to disrupt this dynamic in order to bring them in?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Do we know how much the agencies are creaming off the top for-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	How much?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Can Mr. Smyth supply us with general figures regarding this dynamic? If it is â‚¬31 million, it is a big chunk of change out of Tusla's annual budget. If 10% is going to recruitment agencies, that is an unmitigated scandal. I am not blaming the witnesses for that - that is the way the system is working - but there is something inherently wrong in that. My next question concerns fostering. Of the 1,453 social workers, how many are in fostering? There is a perception that people are moving more and more into fostering. Mr. Smyth may correct me if I am wrong in my perceptions, but child protection, for instance, is incredibly difficult work both psychologically and from the point of view of stress. I imagine that there may be a perception that fostering is a little easier. I am not saying it is not challenging - I am trying to understand the dynamic - but I imagine there is a high rate of attrition, not people leaving the service but moving into another service within the overall family. How many are moving across from child protection or other areas?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	Fostering is as difficult and challenging as the other areas.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:10:00+00:00	My last question concerns international best practice. The witnesses may not have the answer now. I perceive that the role of a social worker in society today is potentially very much more complex than it might have been ten, 15 or 20 years ago. Is there a natural rate of burnout? Is there a period of years beyond which one should not work so as to guarantee the well-being of the individual social worker? Again, this is just perception. One would imagine that if one were working at the coalface of child protection for ten, 15 or 20 years, managing those stress levels would become harder and harder. Is there a period after which one should leave? I ask this because if the answer is in the affirmative, that has a bearing on the strategy for graduate recruitment and so on. I just wonder if Tusla is dealing with that dynamic. It is a complex question, to which a complex answer is probably required.If the witnesses cannot answer now, I understand, but it would be useful if they could revert to the committee to give us a sense of that dynamic.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:20:00+00:00	Is that process under way?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-02-13T11:20:00+00:00	Is someone kicking the tyres in the process to see if it works?
