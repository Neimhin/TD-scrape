SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When will the forestry (amendment) Bill and the foreshore (amendment) Bill be published?  May we have the exact dates for publication?  With regard to the animal health and welfare Bill, given that this legislation has been included in the legislative programme for over a year and extensive consultation has taken place, why has the Bill not being brought before the House to date?  Although I have been in the House for over a year, I have not yet received a proper explanation as to the reason the Bill has not yet been published.  I am Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and I am dying to get my teeth into legislation, but we have not had any from the Department during this time.  We also deserve an explanation for this.We go through the same charade every week.  Members want to raise issues affecting their constituencies, but are prevented from doing so.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We need to have some light on the rules and regulations because this is an archaic institution in the way it is being operated.
