SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is amazing how a consideration of a combined budget from the European Union and from our own resources of €3 billion can come down to a debate about Mallow.  I was initially of the view that there would be no difficulties in moving the office from Mallow to Fermoy, there being only a few miles in the distance.  However, there are issues in regard to whether or not it will cause difficulties for farmers who use the service in terms of how far they will have to travel if the office moves to Fermoy.  There is no question that it is a source of concern.  I hail from the town of Mallow so one might argue that I am bound to say that.  I was initially in favour of the Fermoy proposal but I ask that the Minister consider the difficulties it will pose for service users.  There is no doubt that it will present difficulties for some.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Through the Chair, the Minister is describing a scenario whereby the capacity within Cork city will be reduced.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	While the Department will be moving out of Cork city, it will build capacity wherever it moves to and its overall capacity will not be reduced.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Absolutely.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	A lot of office space in Mallow already has been built and is in turnkey condition.  It also would facilitate that process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Subhead B provides for research and training and I refer to Teagasc.  Reading the Minister's overall statement, one gets the sense there is a focus on Bord Bia and I note the Department's provision for an investment in graduate training there.  While I acknowledge this is provided for in a later subhead, I am trying to discern the overall picture.  Were I sitting in the Minister's seat, the question would be what would I do.  One thing I would strive towards would be to ensure that the research and training budget, particularly that of Teagasc, would be maintained.  I would fight any proposals, such as those contained in the McCarthy report, to consolidate the overall national science budget, whereby proposals would be drawn from a single pool.  I believe that Teagasc has major potential to bring up by a peg or two the 8% of employment in this sector because of the work it does and because of the potential that lies within its organisation.  Food-based research is where Ireland will deliver in respect of export markets.  While I acknowledge there has been an increase in the allocation of resources in this regard, I would argue that broadly speaking, it should be fought for tooth and nail at Cabinet level to ensure that Teagasc is not compromised in any way.  I understand that an examination of the scientific community in its entirety could lead one to conclude there is an argument that duplication of effort may be taking place.  However, Teagasc's capacity should not be undermined in any way.  It has the capability to deliver added value to this economy.  I make these remarks as a broad statement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What was this reduced from and to what amount?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If the Minister reduced it, he knows the figure.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Can the Minister break that down into an hourly rate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With regard to the agri-environment option scheme, if I may respectfully say so, the Minister put a little spin on it when he stated that he was pleased to report to the committee that more than 8,000 applications have been received for this new scheme.  It is well under-subscribed.  If it is seen as a partial replacement for REPS then — and I state this without any political charge — it has not worked.  I wonder whether the Minister needs to go back to the drawing board on this.  The Minister should consider whether it is so vastly under-subscribed and a tranche of money is left sitting there for want of a better or modified scheme.  It would be the right thing to do in my humble opinion.Initially I thought it was a very good scheme but the feedback I get is that it is really designed only for people who want to tip away at a little hobby farming here and there.  The person dependent on farming to put bread on the table has no interest whatsoever in getting involved in this scheme because given the amount of inputs and efforts that must be made, the return is negligible.  There is an issue of scale in some aspects where the amount of effort is not worth the time for what one gets in return.  Will the Minister consider returning to it and modifying it in some way?  It speaks volumes that only 8,000 applications were made.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, that is one analysis, but what is the analysis of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  I take the point the Minister has made on the fact that 8,000 have subscribed.  What does he envisage will be the average payment for each of those 8,000 farmers?  Does he think it will be the maximum amount?  Will it be a fraction of that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With all due respect, and I apologise for cutting across the Minister, then the Irish Farmers’ Journal analysis is a theoretical analysis.  Until we see the figures from the Minister and Department we do not know how successful this will be.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To support Deputy Aylward's comments, if we are trying to encourage a younger generation into farming, greater flexibility in respect of late applications to the early retirement scheme would be beneficial.  It would create incentives for people to become involved.
