[<p eid="para_199">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to debate a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the impending announcement of significant job losses at the Sanmina-SCI plant in Fermoy, which is supported by IDA Ireland; the need to ensure those who lose their jobs will be helped to upgrade their skills and access their social welfare entitlements immediately; the need for officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Tánaiste to visit north and east Cork to meet representatives of Sanmina-SCI and other companies, such as Kostal, to try to stave off further job losses; and the need for the Government to intervene directly to assist companies in the region that are under severe financial pressure at this time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_2023">On a point of order, what in the name of goodness does that mean?  Are we given to believe that the Minister is negotiating with the banks for favourable terms for farmers who have undertaken to complete a scheme under obligation of EU legislation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_2042">I want from the Minister a full and final confirmation on whether he will give a guarantee to the House tonight before we vote on this legislation that those affected by this can wake up tomorrow morning and know there will be some stay of execution and those loans will not be called in.</p>]
[<p eid="para_2051">It was a legislative obligation.</p>]
