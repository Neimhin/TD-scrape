Planning for this event is being coordinated by the Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government.  Hosting City of Science will serve three functions. It willprovide a platform to showcase the best of Irish science and research across all disciplines;boost the international standing of Ireland as a leading centre for scientific and research excellence and to provide a framework to demonstrate the world class research system that we have built over the last decade; and,promote careers in science, technology engineering and maths among prospective students and their parents.With regard to the third function, on 6 April last I announced a call for proposals for a year-long programme of events to engage the citizens of the island of Ireland in science.  The intention is to devise a programme of events that will demonstrate the reach of science into almost every aspect of our lives â€” education, business, the arts, sports and our communities.  Partnerships are being sought with organisations and individuals who wish to develop events that will encourage the public to engage with science.The Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser has confirmed that, when this call closed at end June, over 320 proposals had been received from across the island.  An initial overview of these proposals shows strong elements of creativity, diversity and concern to make science more accessible to the citizen.  The proposals are currently being assessed and it is planned to produce a first outline of a programme of outreach activities in the Autumn.
