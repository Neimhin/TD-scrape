SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) are employed by their respective higher education institutions. Therefore individual researcher salaries are a matter for the higher education institutions.SFI is currently supporting approximately 3,000 researchers. On average, approximately  60% of any SFI grant award is a contribution to the salary costs of the researcher teams. The remainder of the SFI award goes towards supporting the research effort through overheads provision to the relevant higher education institution and covering the cost of necessary research equipment.Given the volume of individual awards, in excess of 2,200 to date, and the several thousands of researchers directly supported by SFI since its establishment in 2000, it is not possible to specify precisely the amount of capital grants that were a contribution to the salaries of researchers.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Currently Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is directly supporting approximately 3,000 researchers in Ireland's higher education institutions. The researchers in receipt of SFI grants are employed by the various higher education institutions. Consequently pension entitlements are a contractual matter between the individual researchers and their respective employers.Members of research teams who are classed as public servants are subject to the public sector pension levy.The Deputy should note that responsibility for employment conditions in the higher education sector falls to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.
