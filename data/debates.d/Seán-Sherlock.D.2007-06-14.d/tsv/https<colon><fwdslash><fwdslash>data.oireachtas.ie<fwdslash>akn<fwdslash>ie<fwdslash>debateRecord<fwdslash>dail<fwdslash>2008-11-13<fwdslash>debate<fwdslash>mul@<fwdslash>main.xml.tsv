[<p eid="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the proposed lay-offs at Kostal Ireland at Mallow and Abbeyfeale and the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to engage with the automotive industry and wider car dealership industry to stem further job losses, particularly for those who are engaged in the production of automotive parts and to find ways to assist the industry through the involvement of all relevant State agencies and where possible to ensure the social welfare entitlements of workers on short-term contracts are not adversely affected.</p>]
[<p eid="para_244">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_246">That is farcical.</p>]
