[<p eid="para_8">I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss the motion I have proposed and which has been referred to the select committee for consideration. The motion seeks Dáil approval of the terms of the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation between the European Union and its member states, of the one part, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, of the other part. Vietnam is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN. Co-operation between the EU and ASEAN members is currently based on the 1980 co-operation agreement between the European Community and ASEAN, which was extended to Vietnam in 1999, and the 1995 agreement between the European Community and Vietnam. In 2007, the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate a framework agreement on partnership and co-operation, PCA, with Vietnam. The PCA was signed by all parties on 27 June 2012 and represents an important step towards enhanced political and economic engagement by the EU in the south-east Asia region. It replaces agreements on co-operation between the EU and Vietnam dating from the mid- and late 1990s. The new agreement is intended to strengthen political, economic and sectoral co-operation across a wide range of policy fields, including peace and security, conflict prevention, crisis management, trade, environment, energy, science and technology, as well as good governance, tourism and culture, migration, counter-terrorism and the fight against corruption and organised crime. It also aims to further enhance co-operation in responding to global challenges, where both Vietnam and the EU are playing an increasingly important role. Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and Vietnam, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement. It is called a “mixed competence” agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence, while others remain within the competence of the member states.</p>, <p eid="para_9"> Vietnam has now become one of the EU's main partners in south-east Asia. In 2014, the EU was the second trading partner for Vietnam after China, not including trade within ASEAN, representing 10% of total Vietnamese trade. The EU was Vietnam’s second export destination, after the US, with the EU purchasing as much as 18% of Vietnam's global exports. In 2014, EU-Vietnam trade in goods was worth more than €28.2 billion, with €22.1 billion of imports from Vietnam into the EU and €6.2 billion of exports from the EU to Vietnam. Vietnam's key export items to the EU include telephone sets, electronic products, footwear, textiles and clothing, coffee, rice, seafood, and furniture. EU exports to Vietnam, meanwhile, are dominated by high-tech products including electrical machinery and equipment, aircraft, vehicles and pharmaceutical products. Total bilateral trade in services amounted in 2013 to €2.9 billion, with a slight surplus for the EU. The EU is one of the largest foreign investors in Vietnam. In 2013, EU investors committed more than €500 million in foreign direct investment and thus it remains Vietnam's sixth largest foreign investor partner. Since 2013, Vietnam has been the EU's fourth most important trading partner among the ten ASEAN member states, surpassing the EU’s bilateral trade with Indonesia.</p>, <p eid="para_10"> The conclusion of the PCA facilitated the launch of negotiations on a free trade agreement, FTA, with Vietnam. The EU is looking forward to the realisation of the potential of the trade and investment principles established in the PCA through this future EU-Vietnam free trade agreement, which will bring two-way trade and investment to new levels. The FTA negotiations started in 2012 and agreement was reached in principle in August 2015, with some technical issues and legal text just finalised. On 2 December, the European Commissioner for Trade and the Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade issued a declaration announcing the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the FTA, which also referenced the soon-to-be-ratified partnership and co-operation agreement as representing milestones on the path towards a maturing comprehensive political partnership. Signature of the FTA will take place at a technical level, most likely in January 2016. The aim is to have the FTA ratified as soon as possible in order that the agreement can enter into force in early 2018. The partnership and co-operation agreement is to enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the other of the completion of the relevant domestic legal procedures necessary for its entry into force. As the agreement involves mixed competence, it must be signed and ratified by all 28 member states. Some 24 member states already have ratified the agreement. Four member states, including Ireland, have yet to ratify. The other three are France, Italy and Greece. In Ireland’s case, the approval of Dáil Éireann is required prior to ratification of the agreement.</p>, <p eid="para_11"> On 23 February 2015, the European Parliament was officially requested by the Council to give its consent to the draft Council decision on the framework agreement for the comprehensive partnership and co-operation agreement, PCA, between the EU and Vietnam. This debate will take place in the European Parliament’s plenary session today, 16 December. Only after the ratification by all member states and by the European Parliament may the Council finally ratify the PCA and the PCA can enter into force. The ratification of the EU-Vietnam agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Vietnam but charts a course for much-needed political and economic reforms. Through Ireland’s ratification of this agreement, we will show our own support for the people of Vietnam. The EU will provide assistance to Vietnam with the implementation of the reform measures. In terms of financial assistance the EU, between the years 2007 and 2013, made available €298.4 million to Vietnam to support national reforms and modernisation efforts. The EU will continue to provide assistance in the current and future years and has approved a new multi-annual indicative programme, for the period 2014 to 2020, of €400 million to support Vietnam's socioeconomic development.</p>, <p eid="para_12"> In conclusion, I thank the select committee again. I hope this motion will meet the committee’s approval and that Dáil Éireann will approve the terms of the agreement in order that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future. For the information of the Chairman and members, I am accompanied by Kevin Dowling, director of the Department's bilateral co-operation unit, and Paul Griffin, who is on my left, as well as Maeve Collins, regional director for the Asia-Pacific unit and a former ambassador to Vietnam, and Fiona Nic Dhonnacha, deputy director of the Asia-Pacific unit.</p>]
[<p eid="para_19">I thank the Chairman. Vietnam is showing increased interest in importing agricultural produce from the European Union, that is, from individual member states. This should present an opportunity for Ireland under the free trade agreement, FTA, but in particular with regard to access to the Vietnamese market for pork. I have to hand a note that tells me the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has sent, relatively recently, a chief veterinary officer letter that expressed interest in beef access, as well as a proposed draft veterinary health certificate for beef. In addition, separate letters have been sent in respect of sheepmeat and pork offal. The Government is awaiting replies to these letters and will then take it from there. As the Chairman is aware, Irish milk product has been in the Vietnamese market since August 2015 and it is expected that dairy products on offer within the Vietnamese market will increase significantly in 2016. This outline will give members an insight regarding the potential there.</p>, <p eid="para_20"> On the aid programme, Vietnam is a key partner country I have not visited but the Government remains firmly committed to the aid programme. I understand the Chairman has visited.</p>]
[<p eid="para_22">I thank the Chairman. Vietnam is Irish Aid's only key partner country located outside sub-Saharan Africa and the Government remains committed there. I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has been there and that a delegation from that committee, led by its Vice Chairman, travelled in early March to Vietnam where they visited Irish Aid programmes in Quang Tri and Ho Chi Minh City. Ireland's commitment to the Irish Aid programme is consistent. If the Chairman wishes, I can ask Ms Maeve Collins, or Mr. Kevin Dowling, rather, to give the committee further insight on the status of the programme in real and financial terms.</p>]
[<p eid="para_44">I will endeavour to answer all of the questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">If I do not answer them comprehensively, I might defer. There are some specific questions on certain areas of Vietnam of which I would not necessarily have knowledge and on which I will defer to others.</p>, <p eid="para_47"> On the issue of human rights, for the information of the committee, only yesterday the EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue took place.</p>, <p eid="para_48">It is an important mechanism for us at both bilateral and multilateral levels, but through the prism of the European Union, to have a very frank, open discussion with the Vietnamese Government on human rights issues. As members know, this is led by the European Union, but our embassy in Hanoi is represented.</p>, <p eid="para_49"> Let me provide an insight into some of the issues discussed yesterday. The dialogue is broadly constructive but with an emphasis on concrete co-operation in the protection and promotion of human rights. Some of the key areas we have flagged are judicial and legal reforms, freedom of expression, the rights of persons of concern, and space for stakeholders promoting human rights in the civil society space. Also included are multilateral issues, including UN mechanisms, and HRC membership and co-operation.</p>, <p eid="para_50"> Vietnam has now ratified the UN Convention against Torture. This happened earlier in the year. The European Union offered some technical assistance on this and on implementation. The European Union welcomed the reduction in the number of crimes eligible for the death penalty. Seven offences were removed from the list. The Union recalled its support for a moratorium on Vietnam. Vietnam indicated it has focused its judicial and legal reforms on protecting and enhancing rights linked to the millennium development goals and vulnerable social groups. Also in the area of human rights, there was an opportunity to raise a number of individual cases, particularly those of prisoners and other persons of concern. The European Union also raised the matter of police brutality and the growing number of attacks on human rights and civil society activists. Ireland, through our embassy and in co-operation with other EU embassies, consulates and missions, is vigilant in the area of human rights.</p>, <p eid="para_51"> On the broader question on the scrutiny of trade agreements, free trade agreements, or in this case a partnership and co-operation agreement, time should always be found for greater exploration of agreements. This committee is the obvious place for that, but I take the broader view that Ireland, through its economic diplomacy in terms of increasing its trade potential across a broad range of sectors, should not jettison the need to ensure that we remain vigilant with our EU partners regarding the very issues discussed here, such as human rights. By continuing to co-operate economically, there is no variance between the needs of our development co-operation programme and the need to ensure we trade substantially on a bilateral level, or through the European Union, with countries such as Vietnam. We all see the potential in Vietnam.</p>, <p eid="para_52"> The Irish taxpayers' commitment to the Irish Aid budget for 2015 amounts to €12 million, which is substantial by any standard in terms of mapping a single bilateral relationship from an Irish Aid perspective. That allows us to work with the Vietnamese Government, for instance, on its own socioeconomic development strategy in providing general budget support. That accounts for resilience in economic activity and also for sustainable economic growth, which is one of the key pillars of our own foreign policy and Irish Aid policy. That allows us some degree of traction at bilateral level regarding workers' rights or exploitation. It allows us to ensure that we fund programmes that are acting with probity with regard to the treatment of Vietnamese workers. However, there is obviously a long way to go in the realisation of full rights, and we must remain vigilant in this respect. I would argue that we do so.</p>, <p eid="para_53"> On the question of why the agreement was signed in 2012, there is no particular reason. I would not necessarily regard it as a delay because we have excellent bilateral relationships. That we are dealing with this now is not a reflection on our support for Vietnam. We continue to ensure we maintain the investment in strengthening political and trade links with Vietnam for the future. We are also awaiting the consent of the European Parliament. The matter is being discussed in the European Parliament today. Therefore, there is no question of Ireland holding up any progress.</p>, <p eid="para_54"> There were some very specific questions on the church, particular geographical areas and the protection of the environment. There was a question on anti-dumping measures. Before I defer to Mr. Kevin Dowling and, perhaps, Ms Collins, who can give some insight based on her in-country experience, and noting what was said by Deputy Crowe about the AWEPA meeting, it must be noted that I approved yesterday funding for our commitment to AWEPA in Ireland. There are anti-dumping measures within the free trade agreement. Perhaps Mr. Dowling could elaborate on these. I will defer to Ms Collins on some of the very specific issues Deputy Eric Byrne raised.</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">There were some questions on Article 5, so we will address the technical aspects of that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">Can I get clarification from Deputy Crowe on dumping? Have specific examples of dumping been referenced by NGOs or civil society?</p>]
[<p eid="para_71">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">I think so, too.</p>]
[<p eid="para_78">I will ask Ms Collins to discuss the trigger mechanism further.</p>]
[<p eid="para_80">Deputy Durkan sought clarification on aid for trade. It is widely known that Ireland does not tie its aid to trade. We see our bilateral partnership with Vietnam as one whereby one works through general Government support for programmes to ensure economic sustainability and raise standards within the local country. At the same time, through diplomacy and trade missions, we continue to examine trade opportunities that exist between both countries. We do that in a mutually respectful way.</p>, <p eid="para_81"> In the relatively short time that I have been in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my experience is that from a trade promotion viewpoint the relationship is not paternalistic. It is one where there is mutual respect. We continue to work on the aid programme and the development agenda, while at the same time trying to enhance economic and social co-operation. It must be recognised that the social and cultural elements of this agreement are also important. Based on despatches from Hanoi, there is a strong recognition of the need to develop that relationship as much as the economic one. I cannot speak for other countries' specific aid arrangements, but I can say that Ireland does not tie aid to trade. It is a fundamental pillar of our Irish Aid policy. </p>]
[<p eid="para_85">I take the Deputy's point. It is well telegraphed that there is a certain dynamic between certain larger countries and their relationships with sub-Saharan Africa and other regions globally. In terms of long-term sustainable relationship building, I have emphasised sub-Saharan Africa in the past 12 months or so to enhance trade co-operation and to consider the opportunities and challenges that exist. Sometimes there is a tendency to regard sub-Saharan Africa, or Africa as a whole, as a homogenous block, but it is as varied as the European Union if one takes that as a comparable block. Our historical relationship with Africa is different from the relationship with Vietnam and that is for historical reasons in the main. I am not uncomfortable with the idea that, notwithstanding the fact that there are certain issues in relation to human rights, enhancing trade, cultural, multilateral and bilateral links provides the leverage to continue to have frank dialogue such as the one which took place yesterday on human rights. That can only benefit the bilateral relationship in the long term. I have found that relationships are often sustained by visits by Oireachtas Members and Ministers. There have been quite a few ministerial visits and visits by committee members. The Committee of Public Accounts was out there recently. It is true that person-to-person, parliamentarian-to-parliamentarian and business-to-business contact is where one gains on the relationship. That is where the terms of trade become more beneficial. I do not see us tying our aid at all. Our philosophy, based on the fundamental principle of not tying aid, has allowed us to send difficult messages which needed to be imparted, albeit respectfully, to various bilateral partners.</p>]
