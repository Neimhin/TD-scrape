[<p eid="para_190">I am pleased to bring before the Seanad for its consideration the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011,  the main purpose of which is to make the necessary changes to the Patents Act 1992 to provide for the ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement.  The London Agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, is aimed at reducing the cost of the European patent process to applicants by reducing the requirement to file translations of the granted patents under the European Patent Convention.</p>, <p eid="para_191">Before considering the provisions of the Bill, I wish to set out the background to it.  It is clear Ireland's international competitiveness increasingly depends on marketable high-value goods and services which have strong knowledge content.  In spite of the challenging economic environment, approximately 50% of all enterprises in Ireland continue to engage in significant research and development activities.  A recent report shows that enterprises across all business sectors spent almost €1.8 billion on research and development activities in 2010 and to convert that investment into economic growth Ireland needs an effective patent system.</p>, <p eid="para_192">It is incumbent on the Government to provide the very best framework for these resulting innovations to be captured and exploited in a manner that will create high-value employment.  Any unnecessary legal or administrative barrier in the intellectual property framework that limits access owing to high translation costs or other factors will not serve its purpose.  Providing efficient and affordable access to registering patents is vital to stimulating innovation in Irish enterprises, universities and research institutions.  The high cost of obligatory translations of granted European patents acts as a deterrent to filing patents and, as a consequence, to innovation.  By lowering the current cost barriers to entry and enhancing SME access to the patent system, the London Agreement represents a significant step forward for the European patent system.</p>, <p eid="para_193">As for the London Agreement, the European Patent Office, established by the European Patent Organisation, is an intergovernmental institution comprising 38 European states, including the 27 EU member states.  The office examines patent applications and grants a European patent, should the relevant conditions be met.  Patent applications originating in Ireland and granted by the European Patent Office have been increasing steadily, underlining the importance to the Irish research sector, both public and private, of European patent protection.  Since 2004, the number of Irish patent applications to the European Patent Office has risen by48%, with grants of European patents to Irish applicants increasing by 34%.  However, the patent process at European level is both complex and expensive, acting as a disincentive to innovation, especially for young innovative start-ups with limited resources.  An enterprise endeavouring to protect its innovation throughout Europe will apply to the European Patent Office for a patent.  At this stage, applicants can file their application in English, French or German, thus saving on translation costs at this early stage.  The claim which sets out the limits of the monopoly granted is published in the three languages upon grant.</p>, <p eid="para_194">Once granted, the European patent is, in effect, a bundle of national patents and the proprietor must validate or file the patent in each state in which patent protection is required.  In order to validate a European patent in a country, a full translation of the patent must be lodged in each country designated in the national language of that country.  These translation costs make up a large proportion of the costs of acquiring a European patent and constitute a cost enterprises can scarcely afford at a vital stage of expensive product development.  This process ensures the European patent is uncompetitive when compared with the cost of acquiring US or Japanese patents.  Under the current system, a European patent validated in 13 European countries is approximately ten times more expensive than a US patent and 13 times more costly than a Japanese patent.  The key cost difference is the processing and translation costs involved with a European patent.  In this context, validating a patent in 27 European countries can cost up to €32,000, of which €23,000 alone is for translations.  Approximately 75% of the cost differential between the granting of a European and US patent is due to translation costs.  It is, therefore, right and proper that this cost, which is functioning as a very real barrier to exploiting innovation in Europe, should be tackled.</p>, <p eid="para_195">The publication of the translations takes place very late in the life cycle of a patent.  As these translations are only provided after the patent is granted, they do not serve the purpose of informing the public about new technologies on a timely basis.  It can take up to five years to grant a patent, meaning that any cutting-edge technology described in a patent is usually already in the public domain and rendering the translation, as an information tool, obsolete even before it is completed.  Research has shown that these costs have forced Irish innovators to take a selective, cost-effective approach when designating states for patent protection.  This leaves patents vulnerable in those states where innovators simply cannot afford to validate them.</p>, <p eid="para_196">The advantages arising from implementation of the London Agreement, quite apart from the direct translation costs, can also have a positive effect on research and development and can enable scarce financial resources currently spent on translations to be reallocated to research and development and other business activities.  The London Agreement is now in force in 17 of the 38 member states of the European Patent Organisation, including, importantly, major Irish trading markets such as the UK, France and Germany.  Ireland hopes to join that number shortly and, in doing so, wishes to encourage other states to follow in order to further reduce costs for Irish patent holders registering their innovations throughout Europe.  The overall aim of the London Agreement is to reduce the cost of translations across the 38 member states by approximately 50%.  To reach this level of reduction, it is vital that all contracting states to the European Patent Convention become party to the agreement.</p>, <p eid="para_197">I wish to outline how the London Agreement works in practice.  Article 65 of the European Patent Convention provides that any contracting state may require a translation of the full text of a European patent into one of its languages, if that language is different from the language in which the patent is granted.  Under the London Agreement, countries will, either partly or wholly, waive the requirement for translations of European patents to be filed in their national language.  This means that under the agreement, a member state with English, French or German as an official language will dispense with translation requirements entirely in order to for the European patent to come into effect.  Ireland, with English as an official language, will no longer require a translation into English of the detailed specification of European patents drawn up in French or German.</p>, <p eid="para_198">In accordance with best practice and to assess the implications for Irish inventors and businesses, my Department carried out a regulatory impact assessment in respect of the London Agreement in 2009.  This established that the main advantage of the agreement for Irish inventors seeking patent protection abroad is that it would no longer be necessary for them to furnish translations to the extent currently required in those countries which are party to the agreement.  This would lead to significant savings when filing a European patent in other non-English language European states.  There would be a significant reduction not only in translation costs but in the context of publication and patent attorney fees.  The impact assessment also highlighted that in 2007 Ireland was the origin for some 126 European patents that were granted.  The cost of designating these patents in 28 states was estimated at €6 million.  If the significant impact of additional publication and patent attorney fees are added, this represents a considerable cost to Irish industry.</p>, <p eid="para_199">To bring Irish law into line with the London Agreement, it is necessary to amend our primary legislation.  The core of Irish patent law is the Patents Act 1992, which is designed to meet our national needs and international obligations.  We continue to amend this primary Act to ensure that the patent legislative framework remains robust and fit for purpose.  The Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 is a short but very important item of legislation which amends three sections of the Patents Act 1992 to allow for the forthcoming ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement.  The other two sections provide standard provisions for legislation.</p>, <p eid="para_200">Section 2 amends the provisions of section 119 of the Patents Act 1992.  These changes relate to the translation requirements for official language translations.  It is necessary to delete section 119(6) to ensure that a translation in English of a European patent specification no longer needs to be filed in the Irish Patents Office in order for that patent to have effect in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_201">Section 3 provides for the repeal of section 119A of the 1992 Act in its entirety.  Transposing the London Agreement into Irish law means that this section will no longer be necessary or applicable when section 119(6) is deleted.  Section 4 amends section 121(2) of the 1992 Act and deals primarily with what constitutes an authentic text of the patent in cases of dispute.</p>, <p eid="para_202">Section 5 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions of the Bill.  The text relating to commencement contained in this section is standard in nature and allows for the legislation to come into operation on a date or dates to be specified in an order or orders.  This provides some ministerial discretion with regard to when the Act will become effective in law.  The purpose of this provision is to allow for any administrative changes which may be required before the Act can commence.  In this instance, it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them into line with the London Agreement.  The proposed amendments to the patent rules of 1992 are being drafted at present, in consultation with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.</p>, <p eid="para_203">It is my intention to commence the Act and the new patents (amendment) rules 2012 by way of an order as close to the enactment of this Bill as possible.  The legislation, as published, was the subject of one minor amendment in the Dáil in respect of section 5.  That amendment altered the title of the Minister following on from the change of name of the Department by Statutory Instrument No. 245/2011, which came into effect on 2 June last.</p>, <p eid="para_204">The Bill before the House is just one of many steps being taken to reduce the burden of patent costs.  I take this opportunity to update Senators on a separate development at EU level.  We are working with other member states towards finalising legislation for the creation of unitary patent protection that will reduce the cost of registration and enforcement of patents for businesses.  Various proposals for a single EU patent have been under discussion for more than 50 years.  Just prior to Christmas, 25 member states reached political agreement with the European Parliament on regulations for a unitary patent.  This will lead to the introduction of a simpler, cheaper and more robust patent system in the European Union of the type which has eluded it for decades.  When fully implemented, the unitary patent will enable Irish-based holders of patents to seek protection for their patents across the 25 member states supporting unitary patent protection — representing 79% of the territory of the European Union — for a fraction of current costs.  The European Commission estimates that by implementing unitary patent protection, the overall savings to European business could be up to €50 million per annum, even in the early stages.  These cost savings should be of particular benefit to Irish high-tech start-ups and small enterprises.  When fully implemented, a unitary patent will mean large reductions in red tape and costs.  This will stimulate European innovation and make patents more accessible to all companies in the European Union.  I look forward to reporting back to the House when legislation for this unitary patent and its enforcement is finalised.</p>, <p eid="para_205">Until an EU unitary patent comes into force, perhaps in 2014, Ireland will continue to improve the patenting process in any way possible.  The Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 builds on our continuing efforts to facilitate Irish-based enterprises and research institutions in their effort to ensure that their innovations are properly protected in as many states as possible and at the lowest cost.  I am confident the House will strongly endorse any initiative which reduces costs for innovation in Ireland in an efficient and inexpensive manner.</p>, <p eid="para_206">The enactment of the Patent (Amendments) Bill 2011, followed by our ratification of the London Agreement, will remove the current expensive translation requirements.  In addition, Ireland is likely to be designated in more patent applications, increasing overall patent-related activity here.  It is expected that more inventors and small and medium-sized enterprises, currently deterred from registering patents because of the high costs involved, will be attracted to protecting their intellectual property across Europe.  This will further support Ireland's efforts to generate economic growth through promoting and innovating better processes and products.</p>, <p eid="para_207">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_262">I thank Senators for their great comments.  A number of issues have been raised, all of which indirectly relate to the legislation but are not pertinent to today's process.  Generally, if the starting point for innovation is Government policy interacting with State agencies, there is a very clear sense of purpose in ensuring we do not rest on our laurels.  The recommendations of the innovation task force are being dealt with in an ongoing process, with one recommendation relating to tax credits.  That was addressed in the recent budget and I will deal with that in further detail.</p>, <p eid="para_263">I thank Senators for their considered contributions, which raise issues that must be taken on board by the Government.  A patent is not the only measure of innovation but rather one of a number.  The clear purpose of this legislation is to reduce that burden and put in place a European system, where Ireland will play a part and Irish SMEs and other stakeholders can ensure administrative and legal costs are reduced as a result.  In its complementary policy, the Government is going through a research prioritisation exercise which seeks to build upon between 12 and 14 core themes or areas of research on which we must concentrate in order to interact with the State agencies which Senator Crown spoke of, including Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, academic institutions and multinational companies.  In doing this we try to focus the amount of money spent by the State on research in a way that ensures the basic research requirements and a more applied approach that can drive more economic benefits by creating as many jobs as possible.  Complementary to that is a patents process which ensures that where a citizen, researcher or SME wants to invest in a new patent system, the European system will ensure the burden is not heavy in cost.  The process should be as simple as possible.</p>, <p eid="para_264">An interesting point was made by Senator Mooney regarding the young scientists' exhibition.  When two people from a school in Dublin or elsewhere can develop algorithms at such a stage in their lives, we must be bowled over by the depth of their imagination and creativity as well as the ecosystem which supports them through their local school.  Successive governments have been in this apolitical space and no specific party owns it.  As a State we want to ensure the Irish Patents Office — representatives of which attended the exhibition — can provide people with the advice they need.  When I attended its stand at the young scientists' exhibition, there were a phenomenal number of interactions with students.</p>, <p eid="para_265">The €32,000 figure is average or indicative but we want to ensure we get to a stage where people like the students in question plug into the idea that there is a process for their innovation which is not cumbersome.  Listening to the radio interviews, the people in question were already plugged into the space of patenting their work.</p>]
[<p eid="para_267">That culture is changing in students, who are becoming more aware of the potential.  It is not for the State to own all the intellectual property deriving from the research in which it invests.  That is not a good direction to take and we do not want to create a disincentive for individual researchers or companies with an investment in labs, for example.  They should not have to give intellectual property back to the State and we should foster the creation of such intellectual property or patents.</p>, <p eid="para_268">The Forfás report compiled for the office of science and technology examined the level of support for research and development across all Departments, indicating that total State support for research and development increased from €756 million in 2005 to €941 million in 2008.  The slowdown in the economy was evident, with a slight decline in 2009, with total expenditure in 2010 of €872 million.  My Department has a 2012 budget which will provide €518 million in capital grants this year, which is an increase on 2011.</p>, <p eid="para_269">With regard to promotion of research and development, Science Foundation Ireland has a pivotal role in enhancing Ireland's human capital in strategic areas of scientific endeavours relevant to the future competitiveness of Irish industry and enterprise.  That body has up to 3,000 researchers in 28 centres throughout the State, with up to 500 industry collaborations.  They generate intellectual property, although some is generated within the multinational sector through the existing collaborations.  Multinational companies are increasingly coming here not just because of the corporate tax rate but also because of a very highly evolved research and development facility that exists within this country.</p>, <p eid="para_270">The research and development tax credit scheme provides for a tax credit of 25% of the incremental expenditure incurred by a company in an accounting period on research and development activities.  That can be off-set against a company's corporation tax liability.  I note the points made by Senator Quinn.  Perhaps we could engage further to see whether there are possibilities in terms of graduates.  The research and development tax scheme was enhanced in budget 2012, as promised in the programme for Government.  A greater proportion of the total spend on research and development is now eligible to be written off by including without restriction the first €100,000 spent for the purposes of availing of the credit.  In addition, businesses that outsourced research and development activities to universities or other institutions will be subject to fewer limits in availing of the tax credit — a measure designed with SMEs in mind.  Companies will also have the option to use a portion of the research and development tax credit to assist in the employment of key employees to drive their research and development agenda.</p>, <p eid="para_271">Senator Gilroy made a point on the registration of patents here, in the European Union and in Europe in general.  Irish companies marketing their products strategically choose to apply for a European patent, an international application by means of the Patent Cooperation Treaty or directly to the country to which they want to export.  Increases in the number of filings abroad indicate that export-orientated Irish companies are widening their market reach, expanding into new international markets, opening up new businesses and becoming more competitive and innovative.  Direct European patent filings and international filings under the Patent Cooperative Treaty and by Irish resident companies rose from 667 in 2008 to 687 in 2010, an increase of a meagre 3%, but it is an increase.  Applications for UK patents from Irish-resident companies filed directly to the UK Intellectual Property Office rose from 278 in 2008 to 289 in 2010, an increase of 3.9%.  Applications for US patents filed by Irish resident companies increased from 740 in 2008 to 796 in 2010, an increase of 7.5%.  That trend, where Irish-resident companies are filing directly for US patents, is due to the low cost of acquiring a US patent compared to the European patents system.  I hope that answers the point adequately.</p>]
[<p eid="para_273">On the unitary patent protection and the London Agreement; they are not mutually exclusive.  The purpose is that they would be complementary.  By instigating a unitary patents system one would hope to drive down further the cost of implementing patents to reduce the cost of registration further and to benefit from an estimated €50 million in savings.  It is a mechanism by which one would have a wider European scope.  The aim is the same in that it complements the London Agreement.  I hope that clarifies the position.  If it does not I am happy to return to the matter on the next Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_275">Senator Crown summed up the legislation very well when he referred to reducing obstruction, greasing the wheels of innovation and improving society.  That is key to what we are doing.  It is part of that process.  While the legislation is technical it speaks to the attempts by the Government to increase our competitive advantage, ramp up research and development incentives, as we did in the budget, and ensure that we can mine more of the intellectual property within our research facilities and institutions, and to encourage the SME sector to ensure it can get on board as well in terms of beginning to think more laterally about whether it wants to engage in research and development and to provide incentives to that end.  I hope I have addressed the points in general.  If I have not, I am happy to come back to any points that are outstanding on a later stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_277">There is some loss of income.  The Senator should forgive me for not responding to the question.  The number of applications for patent protection received in 2010 was 792.  There was a decrease of 18% from 2009.  A total of 243 patents were granted in 2010, a decrease of 26% compared to 2009.  A loss of revenue arises in terms of fees for translations in the context of this country becoming a party to the agreement.  As part of the validation process an applicant must lodge a translation for a patent granted in French or German in the office within six months of grant of patent together with a fee of €35.  In 2010 that came to €33,215.  It is worth noting that the figure has been steadily decreasing.  In 2006 it stood at €62,000.  The crucial point is not necessarily the loss of revenue to the State but the increase in the accessibility of the system to people who are innovating within the system.</p>]
