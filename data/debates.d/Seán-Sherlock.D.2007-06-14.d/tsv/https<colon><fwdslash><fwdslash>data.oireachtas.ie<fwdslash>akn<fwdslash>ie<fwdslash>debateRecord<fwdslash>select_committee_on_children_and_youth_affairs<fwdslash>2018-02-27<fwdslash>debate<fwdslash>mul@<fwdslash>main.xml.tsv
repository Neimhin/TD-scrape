[<p eid="para_33">I liked the original wording on line 29, which states, "two persons who are married to each other". Perhaps the Minister will clarify the reason for this change as the section as drafted seemed reasonable and in keeping with the idea of simplifying the language around legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">I thank the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">Forgive my ignorance on this one if I have missed something in the discourse or in the Minister's Second Stage speech but who does the Minister anticipate will be the body to administer the scheme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_48">Okay. I thank the Minister for that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_49">I wish to give notice that I may submit an amendment to this section on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">On the wider section, I wish to give notice that I may submit an amendment on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_76">Before the Minister responds, I would like to ask whether this provision would have cost implications for the administration of the scheme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_80">I thank the Deputies and the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">The vote has been called, as I understand it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">I will come in after Deputy Rabbitte.</p>]
[<p eid="para_146">I was just going to suggest that if the Minister could revert to us with her own amendment or additional wording regarding the Schedule in terms of the income elements, it might be helpful to us. I, too, reserve the right to introduce an amendment on Report Stage on this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_171">I have a question. Forgive me if I am out of order. The Chairman or clerk can correct me. It strikes me that in article 13(3) states "In making the regulations under subsection (2), the Minister shall have regard to the availability of resources." It says "shall have regard to availability", so it will not be a demand-led scheme at all, will it?</p>]
[<p eid="para_173">It will not be a demand-led scheme. In other words, the budget will be available to meet the demand.</p>]
[<p eid="para_186">We are proposing to accept this but with the proviso that we may revisit the amendment on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_188">It is on the record. I thank the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_195">I support the amendment. I refer to the Minister's Second Stage speech where she said that the legislation is designed to "improve outcomes for children by providing access to quality, affordable child care ... help parents transition from welfare to employment," as well as supporting lifelong learning, advancing gender equality and so on. I support the amendment. We might seek to get an assessment from the Minister as to how she herself plans to kick the tyres of the scheme, one might say, using quantitative and qualitative methods to ensure the legislation is working. I am not sure but I suggest that six months might be too short a timeframe, although I have an open mind on that. Will the Minister give us an idea how she plans to kick the tyres on her own legislation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_207">Yes. I support Deputy Rabbitte. I am aware of one facility in my constituency where children are admitted to the after-school care programme when they are only a few months old and right up to the age of nine. The Deputy wants to ensure that such care is continued and that any transition is as seamless as possible, which I support. I would like to hear the Minister's ideas, knowledge or wisdom on the matter. It would very useful to make the transition less onerous for the people concerned.</p>]
[<p eid="para_212">The Minister will forgive me if I do not fully understand what she has said. In terms of section 14(1) and Schedule 2, the agreements will be made with each of the following entities: the local authorities; the HSE; the Child and Family Agency, CFA; the Minister for Justice and Equality; and the Minister for Education and Skills. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has said that the flexibilities which need to be added to the scheme will be negotiated with the listed entities. Have I interpreted what she said correctly?</p>]
[<p eid="para_214">I may go a bit off message now but I am sure that the Chairman will let me know if I go too far. There is a scheme administrator. Is there anything built into the legislation that allows for flexibility in terms of the cost of the overhead to the provider?</p>, <p eid="para_215">I have not seen anything about the new scheme in the language of the legislation. Again, I may have missed something when I read the legislation. That is why I mentioned that plain English was used, which is very helpful, when we started to discuss this legislation. </p>]
[<p eid="para_217">I have been around Leinster House for ten years yet I still find the language used in legislation challenging.</p>, <p eid="para_218"> In terms of the drafting of this Bill, is there any provision that the Minister can make, or has already made within the wording of this legislation, that allows for flexibility in terms of the overhead? Can the increasing cost of the overhead or flexibilities be built into the administration aspect?</p>]
[<p eid="para_220">Or to give guidance to-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_222">Yes. One has the scheme administrator or administrators, Pobal, various statutory bodies and various Departments. I would like the Minister to allow some flexibility whereby some percentage is built in that allows for increasing costs.</p>]
[<p eid="para_224">We know that the-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_227">That is why I asked for guidance from the Chair earlier.</p>]
[<p eid="para_229">The language used translates right across the whole body of the legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_231">We are quickly moving through the sections and I decided that I had better get my spake in now in this section before the clock ticks down.</p>]
[<p eid="para_233">The administrators are finding it increasingly difficult. They have told me, and they have said the same to all of us, that their costs have increased.</p>]
[<p eid="para_235">Can the new scheme be designed to include a flexibility to meet the cost of overheads?</p>]
[<p eid="para_237">Forgive me for being a bit wordy, in terms of my language. Is the starting point 2019?</p>]
[<p eid="para_239">In other words, the Minister can fund the new scheme in 2019. This is February 2018 so the timeframe for the run-in is quite short. Given that we have reached Committee Stage, I want the Minister to build a new scheme that caters for the costs that exist for providers in terms of their overheads. I thank the Chairman for his latitude in terms of allowing me to speak to many sections and none at the same time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_270">Chairman, I may table an amendment on Report Stage.</p>, <p eid="para_271"> Question put and agreed to.</p>]
