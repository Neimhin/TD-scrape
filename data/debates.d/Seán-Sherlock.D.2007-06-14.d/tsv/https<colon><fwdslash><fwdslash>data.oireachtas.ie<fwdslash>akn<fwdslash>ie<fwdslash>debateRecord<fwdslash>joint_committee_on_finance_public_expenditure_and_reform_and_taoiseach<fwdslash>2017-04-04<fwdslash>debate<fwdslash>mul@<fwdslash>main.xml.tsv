[<p eid="para_106">I, too, welcome the Governor and his colleagues here today. I want to focus on the tracker mortgages issue. The update of the Central Bank of Ireland's Examination of Tracker Mortgages-related Issues 2017 paper was quite comprehensive and assisted us in getting a deeper understanding of where the Central Bank is in terms of examining this issue. However, where individuals made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and received a negative decision, I am fearful that the Central Bank's examination will not adequately cover all the people concerned. I say this because I have evidence particularly about PTSB. I will refer specifically to PTSB because the Central Bank stated in its report that it had commenced enforcement investigations against the bank. I know of samples of cases where the FSO made a negative decision about complaints and the people concerned have not received notifications that their cases are being examined, neither from the bank nor the Central Bank. Will the Governor give guarantees or assurances to those people that they will receive letters?</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">It must be acknowledged that the Financial Services Ombudsman is very proactive on this issue and has engaged with us on this. I want to look at one of the thematic areas, namely, data protection. This should be apparent to the Central Bank at this stage but I want to get the bank's assessment of this. In the bank's examinations to date, has it found that there are glaring gaps in how data protection law was applied to individual customers when they sought information on specific telephone calls, dates of engagement or correspondence they had? I understand that when complaints were made or when people sought to interact with their bank, especially on the options issue, and again I am talking about PTSB, there were glaring inaccuracies in some instances in how the bank interpreted that engagement. Also, the bank refused in some instances to acknowledge that telephone calls had taken place or that particular correspondence was entered into. When people sought to have records furnished, they were not furnished or, if they were, they might have been furnished inaccurately or less than adequately. I want to ensure that from a consumer protection point of view into the future, where people have issues with their mortgages, a robust system is in place to ensure the data protection element provides protection to the consumer.</p>, <p eid="para_110">I hope the Central Bank will address that matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_112">When looking at this matter, one's instinct is to think that there should be a robust consumer protection entity that is separate from the Central Bank. In other words, it should be decoupled because there is a resources issue. If it is necessary to examine 2 million accounts, presumably microscopically, that gives rise to questions as to whether there should be a separate entity to speak for the consumer in this instance. Professor Lane will understand if there is a certain degree of scepticism in respect of the idea that the banks appoint their own independent advisers to oversee the conduct of the investigations and then liaise with the Central Bank in the process. For all sorts of historical reasons, he will understand that there would be some scepticism about whether the Central Bank can adequately and robustly protect the consumer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_115">On the issue of criminal prosecution, to which reference is made in the comprehensive review to which I referred earlier, there are specific powers in respect of the bank's obligations under section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942. Has the bank referred or reported to the Garda any aspect of its examination of tracker mortgages?</p>]
[<p eid="para_120">Finally, to close the loop, while the Central Bank states that all mortgages are being examined, I seek reassurance that those who have not received correspondence who were the subject of FSO complaints and who received negative decisions will not be outliers. Essentially, I am asking for that assurance because we do not want to come back to this again in the future when another raft of borrowers who have potentially been forgotten about will have a legitimate case to be heard.</p>]
[<p eid="para_122">I thank Professor Lane.</p>]
