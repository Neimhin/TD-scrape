SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2012-09-20T15:40:00+01:00	I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for raising this matter. The determination of selection criteria and processes for admission to medical schools is a matter for the universities and the medical schools in line with their statutory autonomy in academic affairs. A new entry process for admission to medical schools was introduced in 2009 on foot of a recommendation of the Fottrell working group on undergraduate medical education and training. The report of the Fottrell working group formed the basis for a programme of wide ranging reform and expansion of medical education and training in Ireland. These reforms also provided for an increase in the number of undergraduate places from 305 to 485 and the introduction of a new graduate entry medicine programme with 240 places annually. The report recommended that leaving certificate results should no longer be the sole selection method for entry to medical education at undergraduate level and that a two stage mechanism should be applied consisting of the results obtained in leaving certificate and a standardised admissions test which would assess non-academic skills and attributes regarded as important for the practice of medicine. The new entry mechanism, which was introduced by the medical schools in 2009, is based on a combination of leaving certificate results and performance in an independent admissions test, HPAT, designed to measure students' problem solving, understanding and reasoning skills. At the outset the medical schools committed to a review of the new entry mechanism within three years of its introduction. On foot of this commitment, a national research group evaluating revised entry and selection mechanisms to medicine was convened under the auspices of the council of deans of faculties of medical schools in Ireland in 2009. The research group comprised representatives from the academic medical education staff of each medical school, university admission officers and the Central Applications Office. Several international medical education experts have advised the group and continue to do so. The research group has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation to determine the educational impact, reliability, validity and stakeholder acceptability of the new entry and selection approach. An interim report has recently been completed by the group and is due to be published on the websites of the medical schools in the next few days. I have been advised that the findings of the report of the research group will now be considered by the academic councils in the five institutions concerned. Approval of the academic councils would be required for any possible modifications to the operation of the admissions test.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T15:50:00+01:00	This began as a conversation about HPAT and has turned into a conversation about Project Maths.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T15:50:00+01:00	With all due respect to her, I ask Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for the courtesy of allowing me respectfully to respond to her query. I would be happy to engage with her on the issue of Project Maths, knowing that she has made some quite vociferous statements in the last month or so regarding Project Maths. The offer is there for her to engage further on the issue of Project Maths. Is that fair enough?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T15:50:00+01:00	As Minister of State with special responsibility for STEM and Project Maths, I am happy to sit down with her myself in that regard. I have not seen the findings of the report of the research group. As I have indicated, the report is expected to be published within the next few days. I have not seen the report but Deputy Mitchell O'Connor suggests she has already seen some of its recommendations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T15:50:00+01:00	The report will be submitted to the academic councils of the institutions concerned for consideration. It is understood that the report will be considered by the academic councils before the end of the year, most likely in November or December. The implementation of any changes will be a matter for the institutions and their medical schools. More generally with regard to third level entry mechanisms, the Minister for Education and Skills has also received an interim report from the Irish Universities Association of their consideration of recommendations in the NCCA-HEA transitions report which was published last September. The universities have also established a task force to develop more specific proposals regarding changes to the entry criteria for third level programmes, which is also expected to consider issues relating to high points courses such as medicine. The task force is expected to complete this work by the end of the year. I respect the fact that the Deputy has raised these issues. Concerns are being brought to her attention and she has articulated them in the House. I am sure the Minister and I would be delighted to engage with her further on the question of Project Maths, or at least have officials engage with her. I am sure the Minister would be happy to sit down with her to discuss this area.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T15:50:00+01:00	I thank the Deputy for the tenor in which he made his contribution. I acknowledge that the latest quarterly national household survey, QNHS, figures show an increase in unemployment, but we never said recovery would be fast or easy.The Government inherited a jobs market in free fall with more than 250,000 private sector jobs lost in the three years before we took office. That is not a political charge; it is a fact. At the peak of the boom, almost 24% of GNP was attributable to construction, 12% of total employment. The economy is in transition and since assuming office, we have delivered on the plan to build a new economy. Part of this is supporting a transition from the old failed economy based on property, banking and debt to a new sustainable economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation. The Cabinet sub-committee on economic recovery and jobs, through the action plan for jobs, has direct identifiable targets that are addressed directly with the Taoiseach on a regular basis using that reporting mechanism. Part of that process involves the small business advisory group, which includes all of stakeholders, such as ISME and IBEC. They are part of the process of getting the recovery we so badly need. Deputy Calleary mentioned the skills shortage. There is a constant engagement with industry. I met with Google the day before yesterday to see how we could get a further engagement with such companies on the STEM area and that will directly feed into how we address the skills shortage. There are already programmes in play in terms of bridging courses but we must ensure there is a longer term policy goal that ensures we have a throughput of students from secondary into tertiary who are actively engaged in the STEM agenda, through courses such as Project Maths, so the right sort of software engineers and ICT graduates exist for the skills pool needed to sustain the economy in the longer term. Unfortunately, as part of the necessary transition, jobs continue to be lost in construction, banking and the public sector as these sectors return to more realistic levels. While the headline numbers out of work have risen in the latest returns, the CSO data show that, on a seasonally adjusted basis, there was a quarterly decrease of 3,700 in the number of persons unemployed in quarter two compared to quarter one, from 312,000 to 309,000. We are in a period of transformation of the public sector as a necessary step to managing our public finances in a better way. The number of employees in the public sector has declined by 25,800 or 6.3% in the year to June 2012 while the number of employees in the private sector decreased by 0.3% over the same period. This is an improvement on the decrease of 2.2% in those employed in the private sector in the previous year.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-09-20T16:00:00+01:00	The Deputy has stood where I am standing today and knows I will not be drawn on the budgetary process. Let me talk, however, about the EU Presidency. One of the central themes of the Irish EU Presidency will be job creation. There will be statements on Ireland's position on getting Europe to engage on this agenda in due course. The planning is ongoing and this week there was a Cabinet sub-committee on European Affairs where each of the Ministers and Ministers of State involved had an opportunity to discuss the EU Presidency and the core themes we want to ensure are at the forefront. Job creation and growth with the European economy will form part of that. I take the Deputy's point on the public utterances of Ben Bernanke on the US Federal Reserve. There is a different dynamic in the US because it operates on a federal basis. There is a challenge for a member state like Ireland to ensure greater EU co-ordination but it is the Government's view that the role of job creation must be to the forefront of the Irish Presidency. Horizon 2020 is a major pot of money, around â‚¬80 billion, that must be negotiated, along with the multiannual financial framework. There are many Irish companies that will ultimately benefit from that once it is negotiated. It will do more to inject further capital into the research and development arms of Irish companies and SMEs in particular to create those jobs that we want in the economy. There is much to be done on the macroeconomic side. I reiterate, however, that the action plan for jobs is a clear policy statement by the Government that involves all of the stakeholders, including small business, IBEC and so on. That will be a key driver for job creation in the future.
