[<p eid="para_3">I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is giving the reply which will have been given to her. I do not expect the Minister of State necessarily to be in charge of this particular issue. I wanted to raise the issue of the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, BAR, fund, as it relates to the fishing industry. I anticipate that the Minister of State will tell me they are working on it and that it is open to the SME sector. This fund was set up to ensure that money flows into the fishing industry to meet the effects of Brexit. This is money that could very easily go into the fishing industry to allow for supports for processing in particular in a way that ensures jobs are maintained, capital investments are made and innovations can be brought to the industry to allow it to at least survive in the teeth of the storm that is Brexit and its impacts.</p>, <p eid="para_4"> I have been in contact with the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, IFPEA. It tells me six larger companies are now excluded from the processing capital investment scheme resulting from BAR. This is completely wrong and contrary to the principles of the Brexit Adjustment Reserve, where no one is left behind. The six projects earmarked by these companies would have a massive positive impact in their respective communities and would also be real drivers for change within the fishing industry, creating new employment and greater value in exports. They would sustain their companies with product diversification and high-end value added. As a member state, Ireland should be highlighting and pushing forward projects such as these as opposed to the current approach where the fund is deemed to be accessible only to SMEs. </p>, <p eid="para_5"> The Minister of State may refer to the issue of state aid rules in her reply. When he visited Killybegs in September 2021, the Commissioner for fisheries said that there are no state aid rules and we have absolute flexibility to prioritise our funding. We could open that up to larger producers and bring them under the scheme as well. That flexibility is key to ensuring there is a successful scheme. The larger companies themselves can grow the number of employees they have. There is the issue of sub-supply of plant and machinery into the sector under the capital expenditure element. Contractors are ready, willing and able to provide services. They are all waiting for news of this scheme. Increasingly they are becoming frustrated by the fact that the scheme is not up and running and that the manner in which the scheme is devised excludes larger processors. I am asking the Minister of State to take that on board.</p>]
[<p eid="para_13">I thank the Minister of State. When the scheme was being set up, there was an interaction with the task force and discussions on this issue. My understanding is that the recommendations of the seafood task force were to support all sectors of the industry equally because no sector of the Irish fishing industry escaped the negative impacts of the Brexit deal. Enterprise Ireland intervened at the task force to outline where flexibility existed and how state aid would permit supports to the non-SME sector, similar to what occurred during Covid. It was self evident at the task force meetings that some people within the Department had an ideological difficulty with the State supporting certain sectors of the fishing industry even though the European Commission clearly permitted it and actively encouraged it. The evidence of that is the statement of the fisheries Commissioner to which I referred. In addition, we have the remarks of Elisa Ferreira, the Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, who stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_14">In moving forward, we do not want to leave anyone behind. The funding that Ireland will receive will contribute to improve living standards, support economic growth in the country and mitigate the negative impacts in local communities. Those are fishing and coastal communities.</p>, <p eid="para_15"> At the end of the day, we want to see the money flowing. Money needs to start flowing into those communities and into processing, along with providing real-time supports for a sector that all present will agree has taken a hammering as a result of Brexit. We do not want to be creating bureaucratic entanglements that prevent money from flowing into the communities that so badly need it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">The Minister of State has time for a reply.</p>]
[<p eid="para_186">Before the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, leaves, I wish to acknowledge that both she and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to be fair to them, have gone out and met the people involved and tackled these issues head on and they are not sitting behind their desks in their Departments. On that basis, before she leaves, I want to acknowledge the work she is doing. I also raise the issue of the St. Francis welfare home in Fermoy, which was redesignated during the pandemic as a transitional care facility. My understanding is that it is to close temporarily. I just wanted to raise that with the Minister of State and acknowledge her work before she leaves.</p>, <p eid="para_187"> I am glad to have this opportunity to support the motion put forward by the Independent Group. It is a vital motion and I am glad the Government is not opposing it. It has come to my attention that recruitment seems to be at the heart of this issue. We keep being told by the HSE and the Government that the lack of personnel to meet the demand is one of the basic issues. I have received responses to parliamentary questions about this. I asked the Government how much it is spending on recruitment via the HSE, that is, moneys being given to recruitment companies to recruit the talent that is required to meet demand, particularly in respect of respite, which is the subject of this motion. For 2020 and 2021, €12 million was handed over to recruitment companies to sort this issue. What are we spending the money on? Where is the value for money? Why is it that they have not succeeded in recruiting the staff we need to meet the demands of people in this sector who so badly need the services? We need to start auditing and questioning the amount of money being spent by the HSE. It has spent €12 million in the last two years on recruitment companies to recruit staff. I am being objective here but no one could argue that we are getting value for money with that kind of spend. If we were, we would have the staff in place to meet the needs.</p>, <p eid="para_188"> The one issue I am constantly raising is that of Cooleens House, which is under the ambit of St. Joseph's Foundation. I am being told month in, month out and week in, week out, that recruitment is at the heart of the issue and that the centre cannot be reopened to allow people to avail of the services because it cannot recruit the required staff. One can only accept that answer for so long. If we are spending €12 million, surely to goodness that money, wherever it is being deployed, could find somebody to be able to reopen that facility. A person in charge is required. On top of that, there is a Darwinian competition going on whereby the HSE is taking staff away from section 38 and 39 organisations. The HSE is competing with voluntary organisations for staff, which the HSE is responsible for providing in the first instance. Cooleens House is like every other respite facility throughout the country. I only use that example because it is one I am familiar with.</p>, <p eid="para_189"> We need to grasp the nettle in respect of the recruitment issue. For two years now we are being told the issue is recruitment and that we cannot recruit the staff. I do not think we are buying that anymore. We have been quite patient and people have understood that there is a recruitment issue but it is time for us to start drilling down and getting into the weeds of why we cannot recruit staff in a way that meets the demand and the needs of people who are affected. Speaker after speaker has said that families are coming to us as Deputies and Senators saying they cannot get respite care for their loved ones. When we question why that is, we are told it is because we do not have enough staff in the system. We need to start drilling down into why that is and how we can justify spending €12 million. The Government, through the HSE, has spent €12 million in the last two years giving money to recruitment agencies. What are they doing for that money? That is the question.</p>, <p eid="para_190"> I welcome this motion. As I said, I am glad the Minister is not opposing it. There is also the issue of pay parity between section 39 organisations and the HSE. I accept the Minister of State has had meetings with the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, FEDVOL, in respect of that and I understand that around €20 million is needed. The reason I am raising that issue is that there are two cohorts of people who are effectively doing the same job but because of a different governance structure, one set of workers is paid less than the other. Tackling that issue would go some way towards solving the problem of recruitment. We need a bit of energy around this piece of it. It is not fair at a time like this. I will go back to Cooleens House. When I questioned the Minister of State about Cooleens House, she noted that it has six rooms and provides enormous capacity for respite in north Cork. She acknowledges that the challenge of recruiting a person in charge is what is preventing it from being reopened.</p>, <p eid="para_191"> I support the motion. I am glad to have this opportunity but we need to start looking at the recruitment issue. It has been thrown back at us as the reason for the delay or the inability to provide services. We are not accepting it anymore as a reason. It can be solved. The HSE must be questioned and interrogated more on how it can justify that kind of spend at a time when people are crying out for services.</p>]

[<p eid="para_480">I thank Deputy Nash for sharing his time. I wish to refer to flood alleviation works and the challenges people face when they seek to purchase insurance in areas where Office of Public Works, OPW, flood mitigation projects have already been completed. I specifically refer to the Munster Blackwater in towns like Fermoy and Mallow, as well as places in Cork city where we do not yet have full OPW schemes under way, where there is a massive difficulty on the part of businesses and residents to acquire insurance. When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, was in opposition, he put forward the Flood Insurance Bill 2016. The purpose of the Bill was to ensure that people who work, reside or have businesses in areas where flood relief schemes were implemented would be able to get insurance cover.</p>, <p eid="para_481">I understand that Bill died when the last mandate ended. I make no apologies in saying I will now bring that Bill forward, line for line, in my name. We will put it to the test and, it is to be hoped, if a member of Fianna Fáil does not put forward the same Bill in the intervening period, in which case I would be very happy to yield, I will put forward that Bill on behalf of the Labour Party to test the theory that Fianna Fáil will be serious about ensuring that people who live in areas where flood alleviation works have been carried out will be able to get that cover.</p>, <p eid="para_482"> While I am speaking about flood alleviation works and the OPW, that scheme in Fermoy cost €30 million. It was a fine scheme. An incident took place there on 21 February last year, when a small number of premises were adversely affected and were flooded. The owners of those premises have yet to receive any kind of compensation or report in respect of what took place there. This is relevant to the insurance issue because when incidents like this occur, where relief works do not work completely and there is a breakdown somewhere, and where we do not have sight of the report in respect of Fermoy, it feeds into the narrative from the insurance companies that they do not have to cover these towns where works have been carried out. It strengthens their hand. I am hopeful, in putting forward the Flood Insurance Bill that, as I said, a member of Fianna Fáil or the Government will come forward and now promulgate this Bill, which was initiated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. If they do so, I will happily withdraw my Bill. We will test the Government on that to see if it is serious about providing flood insurance cover in those areas. </p>]
