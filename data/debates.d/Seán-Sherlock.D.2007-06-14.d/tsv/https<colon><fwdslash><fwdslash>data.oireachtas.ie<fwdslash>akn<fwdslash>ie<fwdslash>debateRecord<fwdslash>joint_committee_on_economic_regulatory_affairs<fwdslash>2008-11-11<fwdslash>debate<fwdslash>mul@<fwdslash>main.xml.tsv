[<p eid="para_30">I welcome Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's clarification of the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>credit rating versus credit referencing.  The objectives set out by the Irish Credit Bureau are clear and a distinction has been made in that sense.  An issue arises regarding the objective of aiding avoidance of over-indebtedness.  If my mode of putting questions is wrong, Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh may correct me.  If somebody who is not part of the group of 80 members seeks information on a particular person, is a facility available whereby the ICB will provide information on a particular individual to third parties?  Is information on the credit histories of individuals freely available to the 80 members of the ICB?  </p>]
[<p eid="para_33">To clarify, is it correct that the Irish Credit Bureau does not make lending decisions, as such, and is, as has been stated, a librarian or facility for storing data?</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">There is, in effect, an element of rating involved in the activity of the Irish Credit Bureau.</p>]
[<p eid="para_37">I beg Mr. Ó Tighearnaigh's indulgence on this issue.  I am trying to enhance my understanding of the issue and ask him to forgive me if my questioning appears persistent.  Is there scope for the Irish Credit Bureau to develop as a credit rating agency?</p>]
