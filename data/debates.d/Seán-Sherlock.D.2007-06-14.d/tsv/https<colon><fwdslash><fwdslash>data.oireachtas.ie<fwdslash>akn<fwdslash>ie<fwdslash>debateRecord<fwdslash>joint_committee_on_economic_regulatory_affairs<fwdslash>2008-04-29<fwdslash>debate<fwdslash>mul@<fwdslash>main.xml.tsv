SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I apologise for missing the initial contribution.  I join members in welcoming the delegation before the committee.  I, too, am on a steep learning curve.  Generally speaking, there is confidence in the system of regulation while there is a lack of confidence in the market mechanisms.  It is important to make that distinction.My questions are predicated on practical matters, for instance, the high degree to which the banking sector has issued loans on foot of what is effectively property speculation.  I do not know the percentage but I wonder if the downturn in that sector has left the banking sector vulnerable to a situation similar to that of Northern Rock and other institutions.  I realise we make the distinction between the sub-prime market and the position as it relates to Ireland in that Ireland would not have been a victim of the sub-prime lending scenario, so to speak, but it appears a great deal of money is tied up in property.  If a downturn occurs in the construction sector and there is potential for defaulting on loans, does that leave the banking sector vulnerable?  Is there a role for the regulator in that regard in seeking to modify the behaviour of banks in terms of the way they loan to their customers in the future?  I am sure there has not been much lending to other sectors with growth potential within the economy, and perhaps that is something that should be examined.  In agriculture, for example, only 2% of all lending relates to agricultural output but I would like to hear the representatives' view on that.In terms of the potential for a banking crisis, I imagine the risk to be low but it always exists.  In regard to the amount of money on deposit by individual citizens, do the representatives believe there is enough protection in place to ensure that if one or two banks go bust, the money they have on deposit is adequately protected?  I understand there is a mechanism in place and a fund with the Central Bank for depositors but in the current climate, and given what has happened abroad, are there grounds for enhancing that provision?With regard to the European Union financial services action plan, the first question is a practical one.  Is it a binding action plan on all member states and, if so, what percentage of that action plan has been transposed into law?  How are the representatives monitoring the transposition of those laws and regulations?  Is there scope for better legislation, given that the Lamfalussy report in 2001 instigated the financial services action plan?  Is there scope for a review of that or could we have better regulation to achieve the maximum amount of output in the economy, which is what we are talking about?I am heartened that the organisations have put themselves up for external review.  That is always a good benchmark because self-regulation is not always the most effective.  The fact that they constantly review their operations would give some grounds for confidence also.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The financial services action plan allows for, say, Bank of Ireland or AIB to set up operations in other countries.  In doing so, would they be subject to their host nations' regulatory regimes?  Are banks which set up operations in this country subject to our regulatory regime governing, for example, issues relating to liquidity, or are they only subject to the regulatory regime of their home country?  It is important to maintain confidence in the system because if confidence fails, it has implications down the line.
