[<p eid="para_35">I also welcome Mr. Fagan and Mr. Egan to the meeting.  The basis on which the gentlemen are here is that there is a strong perception within this committee that there is a problem, the existence of which is being communicated to us by landowners.  We feel it necessary to bring this issue to the fore.</p>, <p eid="para_36">In terms of the submission that has been made, we all agree that Transport 21 exists and acknowledge the work that has been done by the NRA and the infrastructural projects taking place.  I have certain issues with regard to the Mallow northern relief road.  I can only speak about a specific project where landowners negotiated positions, agreed to cede their properties — which is effectively what this is about — to the project to deliver a northern relief road and waited untold months for the notices to treat to be served to be told that there was a change in Government policy and that this would not be expedited.  There was a sense that landowners had entered into this in good faith and were then told that the whole thing was off the cards because of Government policy.  It is very frustrating for landowners who, either themselves or through their agents, have expended resources and bought into a process to be told that it is not now happening.</p>, <p eid="para_37">In practical terms, there should be a review of the December 2001 agreement because it is clearly not working to the landowners' advantage.  There are problems with it and the 30-day aspect of it.  Once title and other issues have been resolved, in many instances, it is clear that compensation is not being paid within the 30-day period.  I wonder whether the NRA feels there is scope for a legislative process to review that agreement.  If we are talking about land which the NRA is seeking to obtain for an infrastructural project for the common good and given that the significant sum of over €1.37 billion has been expended on the acquisition of land since 2003 and will probably increase in the future, perhaps the basis of such agreements for the acquisition of land should be put on a statutory footing.  For example, where a landowner has not received his or her agreed compensation after a certain period, he or she would have a recourse to law.  I do not expect the National Roads Authority to answer this question but the matter should be examined and put on a firmer footing.  It is the perception of landowners that it is operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  The 2001 agreement is not working in favour of the landowners who bought into it and became active stakeholders.  The process must be reviewed.</p>]
