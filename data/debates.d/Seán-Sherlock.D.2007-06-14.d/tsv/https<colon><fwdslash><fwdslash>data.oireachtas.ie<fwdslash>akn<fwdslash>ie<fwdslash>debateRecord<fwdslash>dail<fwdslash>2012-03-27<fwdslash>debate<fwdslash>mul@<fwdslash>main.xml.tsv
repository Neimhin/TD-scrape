[<p eid="para_3181">As the Deputy is aware, Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is a tool used by Government Departments and Offices for the structured exploration of different options to address particular policy issues and it is used where one or more of these options is new regulation or a regulatory change.  This process helps to identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with new regulation and to quantify the likely costs of compliance on the individual citizen or business. The European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 (i.e. S.I. No. 59 of 2012) was enacted to ensure the return to the legal position that was considered to pertain, in relation to injunctions against intermediaries, prior to a High Court judgment in the case of EMI Ireland and others versus UPC in October 2010.  This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.   It is important to note that there was no policy or regulatory change put forward in this Statutory Instrument as it had been the intention of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 to provide such civil remedies and it had been assumed that such was the case up to the aforementioned High Court judgment <i>.</i>  The purpose of the Statutory Instrument was not to implement new EU legislation but rather it has been introduced to merely restate the position that was thought to exist within the copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton’s judgement here and in all EU Member States.</p>]
