SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T16:50:00+00:00	I thank the witnesses. It has been compelling evidence that has dovetailed very much with the evidence of the ombudsman last week. The AOTI submission states:The new SOP does not facilitate the diagnosis of, for example Autistic Spectrum Disorder or Intellectual Disability and will no longer be provided as a part of the AON protocol. Instead children will be identified as ‘health needs’ in the service statement.Mr. Smyth might help me to understand that more fully, as succinctly as possible. If it does not take in ASD and ID, what does it take in? If they come under health needs, will that not exclude potentially thousands of children? Children are being de facto reclassified, which means the services do not have to follow. Is that the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T16:50:00+00:00	I would like Mr. Smyth's perspective on this, if I may, because he is a front-line professional.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T16:50:00+00:00	I do not want to put words into anybody's mouth but my assessment of this, for what it is worth, is that with the SOP, some €7.8 million will be spent by the various community health organisations, and there will be any number of PTAs through the SOP model, but it will not deliver services, in essence, for children. Is that correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T16:50:00+00:00	It is retrospective.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T16:50:00+00:00	It is now the case that the ombudsman has objectively critiqued this model, as have three compelling witnesses. There is an evidence base, based on any rational , independent or objective assessments, to suggest that the policy is completely wrong and needs to be reviewed, reversed, rescinded and reshaped into a new policy, taking into account voices such as those of the three compelling witnesses we have heard from during this meeting. That is something the committee will take seriously. What are the witnesses' views on the consistency of outcomes for children among the CHOs? Reference was made to recruitment. I received a response on 17 September 2020 to a parliamentary question in which I asked the number of occupational therapists hired from each university by the HSE. The witnesses might note the following figures on the back of an envelope if they have a pen handy. In 2016, 135 were recruited, while in 2017, 120 were recruited, which was a reduction. In 2018, there was a further reduction to 119. Thus far in 2019, there have been 73. The difference between 73 and 119 is stark and I imagine that when the figures come in for 2020, there will have been a further reduction. How are we going to crack the conundrum of ensuring there are sufficient trained personnel to deliver the services, depending on what that service needs to look like, following our forthcoming interaction with the Minister? I will ask him these same questions. How are we going to deliver for children if there are not enough people who are suitably qualified to assist children such as Linda's? What is the best way to ensure we recruit enough people in order that every child can get access to the services?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T17:00:00+00:00	Does the PTA-SOP system call into question whether professionals are adhering to their codes of conduct in terms of how they deal with from a moral or ethical point of view with the child who comes before them for a 90-minute desktop service?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-08T17:00:00+00:00	I apologise to the Chair for delaying.
