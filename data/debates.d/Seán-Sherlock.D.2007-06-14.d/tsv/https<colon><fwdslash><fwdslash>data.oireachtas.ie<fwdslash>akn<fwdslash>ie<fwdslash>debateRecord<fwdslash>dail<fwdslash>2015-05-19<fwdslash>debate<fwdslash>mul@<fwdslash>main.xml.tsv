[<p eid="para_1373">The Deputy presumes to know, through that statement, what our personal experiences are.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1375">The Deputy should withdraw that statement. It is ludicrous.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1378">Do not presume to know what our personal experiences are on this side of the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1380">This is pure nonsense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1382">Do not presume to know what our personal experiences on this side of the House are.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1386">How dare she.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1390">That is because I am listening to rhetorical nonsense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1392">Give me some solutions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1395">It is rubbish.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1397">Deputy Daly should read back on what she said in the Official Report later on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1409">I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1411">Deputy McGrath may heckle away.</p>, <p eid="para_1412"> Let me say in the first instance that I recognise the purpose behind the Bill proposed by Deputy Pringle and welcome the opportunity to debate the issues. While I oppose the Bill I would like to assure the Deputies that the Government is fully committed to economic, social and cultural development within Ireland through the annual allocation of moneys and resources via the Oireachtas and also in the context of international co-operation.</p>, <p eid="para_1413"> As Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I would like to begin by setting out our commitment to human rights in the international context. At the end of this year, Ireland will conclude a three-year term on the UN Human Rights Council. On the council, Ireland has worked to promote and protect the human rights of all people, particularly the marginalised and most vulnerable. I am particularly proud of the resolutions we led on combatting preventable mortality and morbidity of children under five years of age. The promotion and protection of human rights is one of six priority areas within our international development policy. Ireland remains committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP in official development assistance as our economy improves.</p>, <p eid="para_1414"> We give particular importance to the role of the UN human rights treaties monitoring bodies. In 2014, Ireland's record under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was examined by the UN Human Rights Committee, a body of independent experts elected by those countries that have ratified that convention. Ireland's delegation was led by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Next month, on 8 and 9 June, Ireland's examination under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will be examined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. I will lead a delegation which will be composed of officials from my Department and from the Departments with responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights.</p>, <p eid="para_1415"> Of course, we acknowledge that the primary responsibility for the promotion and protection of human rights lies within the states themselves. We appreciate the important role of the committee, and all of the United Nations treaty monitoring bodies, in holding state parties to account regarding their international human rights obligations. Ireland was proud to play an instrumental role in the recent strengthening process of treaty monitoring bodies, called the Dublin process, as two key meetings of international experts were held in Iveagh House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1418">I am not sure if it has been distributed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1420">We will make provision for that. I apologise to the House if the script has not been made available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1423">I am sure my officials are watching now and can ensure that it happens.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1425">Without doubt.</p>, <p eid="para_1426">In March, the Government established an interdepartmental committee on human rights to improve co-ordination throughout the Government on the promotion and protection of human rights in our foreign policy. The interdepartmental committee will progress ratification by Ireland of key international human rights treaties, monitor the implementation of Ireland's treaty obligations, and facilitate timely reporting to international treaty bodies in accordance with these obligations. As chair of the interdepartmental committee, I look forward to watching it bear fruit as it becomes embedded in our operational processes.</p>, <p eid="para_1427"> The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is the main treaty protecting economic, social and cultural rights. It was adopted, as has been stated, and was opened for signature, ratification and accession by the General Assembly in 1966. It entered into force on 3 January 1976. Ireland signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1973 and ratified it in 1989. The covenant has been ratified by 164 countries, including all EU member states. The covenant contains some of the most significant international legal provisions establishing economic, social and cultural rights, including rights relating to work in just and favourable conditions, to social protection, to an adequate standard of living, to the highest attainable standards of physical and mental health, to education, to take part in cultural life and to enjoyment of the benefits of scientific progress.</p>, <p eid="para_1428"> In November 2000 Ireland ratified the 1996 revised European Social Charter, which is the Council of Europe's treaty on social and economic rights. I note two of the Deputies opposite have left the Chamber. I hope they will be in a position to at least have regard to the reply, provided on behalf of the Government, to some of the points they made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1432">On the same date Ireland ratified the 1995 additional protocol to the European Social Charter, which provides for a system of collective complaints.</p>, <p eid="para_1433"> While the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has not been incorporated into domestic law, the substance of a number of the rights contained in the covenant is protected by the Constitution and by legislation. Although not cognisable by the courts, Article 45 of the Constitution sets out directive principles of social policy for the general guidance of the Legislature. If we are to move to a situation, and I make a genuine point, whereby this legislation is incorporated such that there is a constitutional referendum, we must be cognisant of the separation of powers between the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature on points of law which might come forward where test cases are made and what the role of the Legislature would be thereafter, or would it be diminished relative to the Judiciary. I make this point in a very genuine way. I know Deputy Pringle in replying to the debate will respond to this.</p>, <p eid="para_1434"> The Government aims at ensuring that the State's obligations to implement the covenant in Ireland are met through policies aimed at improving the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including by fighting persistent poverty and social exclusion and recognising that others, including individuals, families and many organisations and bodies, have important responsibilities as well. The means by which the State sets out to meet its obligations in this area is through the allocation of resources.</p>, <p eid="para_1435"> I will now speak about human rights in the domestic context, notably economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland. Ireland has ratified the instruments referred to above which promote economic, social and cultural rights. Since our last review by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2002, Ireland enjoyed a period of unprecedented economic growth, followed by an equally acute financial crisis, resulting, as we know, in an international bailout package and more than five years of tough measures. Social transfers were used to mitigate inequality and efforts were made to ensure a minimum core content of rights. Our approach was not to apply blanket reductions to all areas of spending, but rather to reform expenditure in a way that continued to protect, where possible, our society's most vulnerable people to the greatest extent possible within our available resources.</p>, <p eid="para_1436"> Since taking office in 2011, the Government has been determined to fulfil the mandate given to us by the Irish people to repair the economy and public finances, create jobs and give our citizens confidence in a better future. The scale of the economic crisis we have gone through is unprecedented in Ireland's history. Difficult decisions have been taken and huge sacrifices have been made by the Irish people, but this has not been in vain. The spring economic statement confirms the path that has been taken was the right one. As we now plan for the remainder of this decade, our citizens have every reason to be confident and hopeful about their future. This future will have steady, stable economic growth and more people working in secure and sustainable jobs than ever before in the history of the State. It will be a future of stable public finances that will deliver money in people's pockets, higher quality public services and strategic investment in essential infrastructure throughout the country. These hard-won gains require protecting and securing and building on them for the future is the priority. The facts clearly show the policies of the Government have worked and will continue to work in the years ahead. Our economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, by 4.8% in 2014, and the Department is forecasting growth of 4% this year. Steady, stable economic growth of 3.75% on average is forecast for the remainder of the decade.</p>, <p eid="para_1437"> The spring economic statement is part of a much broader reform of the budgetary framework. The next in this new framework is the national economic dialogue and I refer specifically-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1440">In the time allocated to me to speak on the Bill I am providing the context in which the Bill is being put forward. On the point made by Deputy Collins, let me say a national economic dialogue will take place in July. This will widen consultation on the budget with key stakeholders and will fully respect the role of the Government and the Oireachtas to make policy. Deputy Collins will have an opportunity to make her own or her party's submission to the dialogue and we look forward to the ideas she will propose in the process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1442">Let me remind Deputy Collins the Government has legislated for the restoration of the minimum wage-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1444">-----and we have taken thousands of workers out of the universal social charge. Let me also say the national economic dialogue is about ensuring we have an informed and mature discussion on the short and medium-term priorities of the Government and beyond. Undoubtedly, in recent years considerable sacrifices were made by the people of Ireland and it posed challenges in terms of the progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland in line with the covenant before us now. However, as I have stated, we are already seeing the fruits of our labour.</p>, <p eid="para_1445"> The public finances are under control with the deficit falling below 3% this year and debt levels are set to move down towards the European average in the next few years. As a result we will be in a position to implement another expansionary budget this year and every year out to 2020 if this is deemed prudent and appropriate. We will meet our medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms over the forecast horizon.</p>, <p eid="para_1446"> In order to return stability to the public finances, gross voted expenditure was reduced from its peak of more than €63 billion in 2009 to €54 billion in 2014. In implementing expenditure reductions, the Government's priority has been to protect key public services and social supports to the greatest extent possible at a time of increasing demand. This targeted approach has meant that primary social welfare rates such as pensions have been fully maintained since the Government took office. Our commitment to protecting society's most vulnerable is illustrated by data published by EUROSTAT earlier this year showing that Ireland's system of social transfers and redistribution of wealth and income to those most in need is among the most effective in Europe at reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.</p>, <p eid="para_1447"> Budget 2015 marked a turning point when expenditure reductions were no longer required to meet our fiscal targets. We are now in a position to provide targeted increases for key services. In the area of education, we have sought from the beginning to protect DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. In 2015, gross voted current expenditure across the key sectors of social protection, health and education will amount to more than €40 billion-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1452">I have been interrupted twice while attempting to do so. I am speaking to the Bill and the context in which it is being presented. The explanatory memorandum states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1453">The purpose of the Bill is to amend Article 45 of the Constitution by adding to the end of that Article a provision, contained in the Schedule, that the State shall progressively realise, subject to its maximum available resources and without discrimination, the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and that this duty be cognisable by the courts.</p>, <p eid="para_1454">I am responding on behalf of the Government on the issue of the resources that are being made available in order to recognise those rights. The Government is fully entitled to do that within the time allocated to it. I am afraid I am the only speaker on behalf of the Government, and there may be a judgment call on that. However, 30 minutes have been assigned to me and I fully intend to speak to all of the issues that have been raised by the Deputies opposite.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1456">The Deputies, including Deputy Joan Collins, had an opportunity to make their points. I am trying to respond to the issues she and her colleagues raised. In 2015, gross voted current expenditure across the key sectors of social protection, health and education will amount to more than €40 billion, or 81% of total current expenditure. In developing proposed budgetary expenditure measures, due consideration is given to ensuring our society's most vulnerable members are protected to the greatest extent possible in light of continued fiscal restraints.</p>, <p eid="para_1457"> I will now outline the key issues affecting Irish people and the Government measures in these areas. Net outward migration is expected to cease next year, with a return to inward migration from 2017 onwards. The young people who have left are coming back and will continue to do so.</p>, <p eid="para_1458"> On the right to work, we have added 95,000 net jobs to our economy since the peak of the financial crisis. It is forecast that we will pass the 2 million people in employment mark next year, replace all jobs lost during the downturn by 2018 and, between 2015 and 2020, add 200,000 new jobs in total. Of course, we must ensure those returning to employment are doing so in the full enjoyment of their rights, including the right to just and favourable conditions of work. The Low Pay Commission, established in February of this year, is tasked with ensuring any changes to the minimum wage are fair, incremental and evidence-based. As part of that, the practice of zero-hour contracts is being reviewed. The establishment of the Workplace Relations Commission will ensure Ireland's employment rights bodies provide for fair and equitable resolutions to industrial disputes. In addition, the Department of Social Protection is in the process of increasing by 1,000 the number of case officers assisting the long-term unemployed in returning to work.</p>, <p eid="para_1459"> Pathways to Work, the Government's labour market strategy, sets out a far-reaching reform of the State's approach to helping unemployed jobseekers return to work. It is focused on making sure as many new jobs as possible, and other vacancies that arise in the economy, are filled by people who are unemployed jobseekers. This programme, which is the largest single reform programme in the public sector, has delivered on a number of significant reforms. One such reform involved the merger and integration of three previously separate organisations, the community welfare service, FÁS employment services, and the Department of Social Protection's income support services, into the one-stop-shop Intreo service provided by the Department. We have seen the reorganisation of the State's further education and training services through the creation of education and training boards, ETBs, and SOLAS, the new further education and training authority. We have provided for the refurbishment by the end of 2014 of 46 new Intreo offices around the country, with a further 14 to be completed. The development of a new operating model as part of Intreo has yielded significant reductions in claim processing times and faster and more systematic provision of employment services. The introduction, as part of Intreo, of a group information process whereby all new jobseekers are briefed on the services available to them saw, during 2014,186,000 jobseekers attending group information sessions. There has been a profiling of jobseekers on the live register to help prioritise and direct the provision of one-to-one employment services. Since this process started, every jobseeker on the live register has been profiled and more than 800,000 one-to-one interviews between jobseekers and case workers have been conducted. The introduction of a claim suspension facility to allow unemployed jobseekers take up short-term and seasonal work opportunities is another in a broad range of initiatives to assist people back to work. </p>, <p eid="para_1460"> More than 60,000 long-term unemployed people have moved into work since the Pathways to Work strategy was launched. The persistence rate from short-term to long-term unemployment has fallen from 33% to 29% and the progression to employment rate for people more than two years unemployed has already reached its end of 2015 target of 40%. That is not ideal and we are striving to do better. In 2014, the Department of Social Protection expanded its engagement with employers. The national employer relations team and divisional employer liaison teams work closely with employers and industry bodies to support engagement with jobseekers and the Department's employer services.</p>, <p eid="para_1461"> The Youth Guarantee implementation plan was published in January 2014 as part of the overall Pathways to Work strategy. Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is to provide assistance to young people to find and secure sustainable employment. For those who do not find jobs, additional offers are provided. In 2014, more than 70% of such offers were in further education or training, while others were in community-based employment programmes such as community employment schemes, the Gateway and Tús initiatives, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment.</p>, <p eid="para_1462"> Budget 2015 announced the back to work family dividend, BTWFD, scheme, which provides financial support to jobseekers and one-parent family recipients with children who end their claim in order to take up employment, increase their hours of employment or take up self-employment. Under BTWFD, where applicants meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme, they are entitled to a weekly payment for up to two years following the expiry of their social welfare claim.</p>, <p eid="para_1463"> The Department of Social Protection administers more than 65 separate schemes and services. Each week, nearly 1.44 million people receive a social welfare payment and, when qualified adults and children are included, almost 2.3 million people benefit from these payments. Some 615,000 families receive child benefit payments in respect of almost 1.2 million children each month. Despite increasing demands across many social welfare schemes, primary social welfare rates have been maintained, including pensions, disability payments and jobseeker's payments. This has ensured Ireland's system of social transfers, which is the context in which the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights applies, remains among the most effective in Europe in reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate.</p>, <p eid="para_1464">The Department of Social Protection carries out extensive analysis of the impacts of tax measures and changes to certain social welfare payments. This analysis is published as part of the budgetary process over a wide distribution of income levels and is further supplemented by regular analysis and commentary provided by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. Furthermore, the Minister for Finance publishes a very detailed analysis of the distributional impact of tax measures across a range of income levels and family types. This is further augmented by hypothetical family case studies.</p>, <p eid="para_1465"> With regard to the right to housing, the Government announced that local authorities were to receive €312 million in order to build 1,700 homes in 100 social housing projects across the country. This is the first phase in a €3.8 billion, six-year strategy to deliver 35,000 new social housing units by 2020. The strategy will increase social housing supply and reduce the number of people on waiting lists by one quarter by the end of 2017.</p>, <p eid="para_1466"> On the right to health, the realisation of universal health insurance remains the objective of this Government, despite some of the contentions of people opposite. We continue to progress plans to provide free GP care to children under six and adults over 70 by July of this year. We are committed to moving away from a hospital-centric model of care to an integrated, safe and efficient model which treats patients as close to home as possible, through the primary care model. The increased allocation provided to the health sector in 2015 will deliver over 1.7 million medical cards and a further 0.4 million GP visit cards. In 2014, staffing levels increased by 2,331 or 2%. The increase in staff has been concentrated in the hospital sector. There has also been €35 million in funding in 2014 and 2015 for enhancements to mental health services.</p>, <p eid="para_1467"> The education sector has faced increasing demands over the past number of years. Primary pupil numbers have increased by over 25,000 between 2011 and 2014; secondary pupil numbers have increased by over 10,000 between 2011 and 2014; and third level student numbers have increased by over 7,500 between 2011 and 2014. Our continued investment in the education sector has seen the pupil-teacher ratio broadly maintained since the Government came into office.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1469">The Government has protected the funding allocations for DEIS expenditure, which prioritises the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged areas. Budget 2015 provided for an additional 1,700 new posts to be created in 2015, of which 920 will be classroom teachers. Special educational needs have also been prioritised through providing funding for 480 additional extra resource teachers and 365 additional special needs assistants. The Government has overseen improved outcomes in education, with more students taking higher level maths, and increasing literacy rates among our 15 year olds. We are also embracing the skills revolution, adopting strategies to ensure continuous up-skilling and development of our workforce to allow our citizens to be at the forefront of new technology and the creation of high-value jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_1470"> Ireland is ahead of the EU average in the gender equality index for 2013 and is committed to achieving gender equality. The national women's strategy has enjoyed success in this regard. It has improved women's standard of living and access to health care, increased female participation in education, expanded the provision of early childhood care, and reduced the gender pay gap.</p>, <p eid="para_1471"> Ireland also endeavours to be a safe and welcoming environment for minorities; one that respects and accommodates diversity in all its forms. There are critiques of that. That is fully acknowledged. The Department of Justice and Equality is engaged in consultation, for instance, with Traveller representatives regarding recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group. It is hoped that a decision on the matter will be reached shortly.</p>, <p eid="para_1472"> On LGBTI rights, the upcoming referendum on marriage equality is held against the backdrop of several important legislative advances for LGBTI persons in Ireland, including the Gender Recognition Bill 2014 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015.</p>, <p eid="para_1473"> This sets the context for our discussion today about economic, social and cultural rights in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_1474"> The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR, requires states that are party to it to take steps, to the maximum of their available resources, to achieve progressively the full realisation of economic, social and cultural rights. The concept of progressive realisation constitutes recognition of the fact that it will generally not be possible to achieve the full realisation of all economic, social and cultural rights in a short period of time. The reference to resource availability reflects a recognition that the realisation of these rights can be hampered by a lack of resources and can be achieved only over a period of time. Equally, it means that a State's compliance with its obligation to take appropriate measures is assessed in light of the resources, financial and otherwise, available to it.</p>, <p eid="para_1475"> Even though states may realise economic, social and cultural rights progressively, they must also take immediate action, irrespective of their resources, in five areas: elimination of discrimination; economic, social and cultural rights not subject to progressive realisation; obligation to "take steps"; non-retrogressive measures; and minimum core obligations. If either of the two referenda on Friday pass, it will be the first time that a proposal for constitutional reform put forward by a constitutional convention resulted in actual constitutional change.</p>, <p eid="para_1476"> I ask the House to reject the Bill, while thanking Deputies Pringle and Healy for putting it forward, because it is important that voice is given to a Bill that seeks to change the Constitution.</p>]
