[<p eid="para_396">I move:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_397">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for a statement of principles to inform the interpretation and administration of the Social Welfare Acts; to provide for a social welfare charter; to impose a duty to promote the take-up of social welfare entitlements; to set out certain rights to information, advocacy and support for social welfare applicants and recipients; to confer additional functions on the Citizens Information Board; and to provide for related matters.</p>, <p eid="para_398"> As set out in the Long Title, this is a Bill to make provision for a statement of principles to inform the interpretation and administration of the Social Welfare Acts; to provide for a social welfare charter; to impose a duty to promote the take-up of social welfare entitlements; to set out certain rights to information, advocacy and support for social welfare applicants and recipients; to confer additional functions on the Citizens Information Board; and to provide for related matters.</p>, <p eid="para_399"> Section 1 provides for the Short Title of the Bill and for its collective construction, together with the Social Welfare Acts. It also provides that the Bill comes into operation six months after its passing. Section 2 is an interpretation section and defines terms used in the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_400"> Section 3 sets out the social welfare principles as follows. The social welfare system contributes to realising economic, social and cultural rights that are indispensable for personal dignity and the free development of human personality. The social welfare system progressively achieves the commitments made in Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 45 of the Constitution. Social welfare is an investment in the people and is accordingly for the public good and general benefit. The delivery of social welfare is a public service. Respect for the dignity of persons should be at the heart of the social welfare system. The social welfare system should contribute to reducing poverty. It should be designed on the basis of evidence and should be progressively improved in ways that put the need of those who require assistance first and should advance equality and non-discrimination. The social welfare system should be efficient and should deliver value for money.</p>, <p eid="para_401"> This section provides that all those concerned with the interpretation or administration of the Acts, or performing functions under them, must have regard to the social welfare principles. In addition, a court or tribunal in civil or criminal proceedings may take the social welfare principles into account when determining any question to which the principles are relevant. However, nothing in this section of itself gives rise to a cause of action in respect of anything done in the administration of the Acts or the performance of functions under them.</p>, <p eid="para_402"> Section 4 provides that a social welfare charter is to be prepared, published and, from time to time, reviewed. The charter must set out what is to be expected from the Government and the Minister when developing social welfare policy; from the Minister, his or her officers and others when administering the Acts or performing functions under them; and from persons who apply for and receive assistance through the social welfare system. The charter must reflect the social welfare principles as spelt out in the Bill and the Minister must prepare the charter within six months of this Bill coming into operation. In preparing the charter, the Minister must consult the board and the persons who receive assistance through the social welfare system or their representative bodies, together with such other persons or bodies as he or she considers appropriate. The Minister must lay a draft of the charter before both Houses of the Oireachtas for their prior approval and must make the charter publicly available by appropriate means.</p>, <p eid="para_403"> Section 5 requires the Minister to review the charter within five years of its being made, and every five years thereafter, involving the same consultation process. Following that review, the Minister must decide whether or not to make any changes to the charter and must lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report setting out the consultation undertaken in carrying out the review, the reasons for the Minister's decision to make changes or not to make changes and, if the Minister has decided to make changes, a draft of the charter showing the changes he or she intends to make.</p>]
[<p eid="para_407">I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."</p>]
[<p eid="para_468">Will the Minister give a synopsis of where stands the beef task force at present? We are all receiving communications from the Beef Plan Movement where there is a clear ask for the appointment of an independent regulator. It would be very useful for us if the Minister in his response could give us an up-to-date position as to where the task force is at present.</p>, <p eid="para_469"> On the status of horticulture, Bord na Móna has made a decision on harvesting peat. As we move down the levels of public health guidelines and garden centres reopen and people begin to purchase compost again, will there be an adequate supply of compost and will we be faced with shortages? Will we be importing compost as a consequence of decisions not to harvest peat, as articulated by Bord na Móna?</p>, <p eid="para_470">I ask the Minister for his perspective on where stands that status at the moment. We all agree that action on climate change is necessary. If it means, though, that we are going to be importing things like coconut derivatives from third countries, then the question will be asked whether in real terms that is real action on climate change. As people begin to visit their garden centres again, they will be wondering whether there will be an adequate supply of compost for the coming growing season.</p>, <p eid="para_471"> On the status of point-to-point racing, we know several meetings throughout the country have been cancelled. I cannot figure out the logic of allowing racing to go ahead because of the importance of the racing and bloodstock industry, as the Minister said, but then disallowing point-to-point race meetings. I would have thought that these two endeavours were complementary and dovetailed with each other. If we can justify holding race meetings, then we can surely justify holding point-to-point meetings. I am a Cork person and I live in Mallow. There is a racecourse there and I recognise the importance of that aspect of the industry. I would like also to speak, however, for the people who operate point-to-point racing. Those meetings will begin to start from March. They are not technically cancelled. I am talking about places like Kildorrery, Dromahane and others which are vital to the local economy. I would like an update on the status of those meetings.</p>, <p eid="para_472"> My last issue is one on which I do not necessarily expect the Minister to have a response. A young woman is being detained by the Indian police. Please forgive me if I mispronounce her name, but Disha Ravi is a young environmental activist protesting on behalf of Indian subsistence farmers. We have a long history of protest regarding farming issues in this country. It is inherent within the Irish polity and psyche to protest or advocate on behalf of farming interests or to do both. I acknowledge Ms Ravi's activism and hope the Irish Government will, if possible, make its views known or register its disturbance at the fact that this young activist has been detained purely and only on the basis of her activism on behalf of environmental issues and to support subsistence farmers in India. I put on the record of the House that Ms Ravi is an activist and that she is being detained. I hope the Irish Government will record its protest with the Indian Government regarding this situation.</p>]
