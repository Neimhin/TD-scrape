SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-23T19:40:00+01:00	There are several specific points I wish to raise on the technical detail of the Bill but before I do so, I wish to address the rainy day fund. The Labour Party is at pains to understand the necessity for such a fund. We are wondering if it was conjured up to make Fianna Fáil look fiscally responsible and whether it is a Fianna Fáil tool or a Fine Gael tool and we seek more transparency and openness in that regard. While the fund may appear prudent, taking €1.5 billion from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is just a change on paper. It is not new money. We would like to know where the new fund will be invested and whether it is simply a bailout fund for the banks. The Labour Party has argued that the money should be invested in affordable housing and to bring about real social recovery. I had hoped the Minister would give greater detail about the rainy day fund, how it will come into being and whether it will specifically be dealt with in the context of the Bill. In regard to action on climate change, Members are now well versed in the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC. I was hopeful that between the Minister's speech on budget day and the publication of the Bill, we would see some real and meaningful action on climate change. We cannot ignore the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council regarding taxes on carbon and mitigating that in such a way as to ensure that those at risk of fuel poverty or dependent on the fuel allowance would benefit from certain allowances in that regard. We cannot continue to ignore climate change and we need some real policy interventions that result in drastic changes in human behaviour. That must start this year, particularly in the context of the IPCC report. I am pleased that members of the panel will soon address the Joint Committee on Climate Action because it is important that we hear from them regarding radical proposals that we would like to see coming from Government. My party and perhaps others in this House would support such measures if they were forthcoming or that the Government would take seriously certain interventions proposed by a committee or by Members of the House. We cannot afford to let another fiscal year go by without making some real interventions or policy changes on this issue. On the universal social charge, USC, a worker on the living wage of €24,500 will gain a little more than €20 a year from the changes to USC but a person earning €70,500, or three times more, will gain €126, or six times the tax cut. This matter will be fully discussed on Committee Stage. Four out of five workers will gain nothing from the changes but the highest earners will gain up to €130 per year. When one combines the USC and income tax cuts, a person on €70,500 or three times the living wage of €24,500 will benefit from a level of tax reduction 14 times greater than will a person on the living wage. The squeezed middle has been completely ignored in that conundrum, so it was not really a budget for that grouping in that context. It was a budget for those on higher incomes.  The cut in USC and the move with regard to income tax thresholds will cost approximately €284 million. Every Member in this House could have thought of very good ways to spend €284 million in terms of delivering better public services, not to mention much more economical steps we could have taken to deliver concrete benefits to the people who need it most. For example, free-of-charge school books at primary and secondary level would have cost €40 million while paying all public sector workers a living wage might have cost €39.3 million so we would argue that it was not a solid budgetary decision.  The home care tax credit is good for those with incomes but not all carers will benefit equally from a tax credit approach. Direct services, like respite care, would be fairer and arguably more useful for many carers. Section 8 rightly removes accommodation and healthcare from being treated as taxable benefits-in-kind for members of the Defence Forces. This is something we welcome. We would like a closer interrogation of that measure on Committee Stage.  Section 22 rightly removes the rent-a-room tax relief from short-term lettings such as Airbnb without affecting relief for student digs as well as regular lettings. We have a proposal to support microbreweries. We have put forward an amendment for the benefit of the Minister's officials that would amend section 78A of the Finance Act 2003, which involves relief for small breweries. Section 78A of the Finance Act 2003 would be amended in subsection (1)(a) by substituting "60,000 hectolitres" for "40,000 hectolitres". This would not increase the alcohol tax rebate such breweries can claim but it would allow them a greater output while still being classed as microbreweries. The EU permits up to 200,000 hl for microbreweries so we are well inside the limits by going from 40,000 hl to 60,000 hl.  Section 25 introduces the controlled foreign company rules, as required by the EU Council Directive 2016/1164 - ATAD. This is an example of how the EU is rightly moving to reduce aggressive tax avoidance practices across the Union. The ATAD, along with the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, show how countries are coming to grips with tax avoidance by multinational companies. We openly acknowledge that Ireland is complying with these new rules and has co-operated with the OECD process as well and so it should. However, we must also think about what this means for Ireland in the medium term. Are we ready to replace our reliance on foreign direct investment with the next phase of our economic development? What is that phase and are we ready? I would argue that we are not. We should be giving this much more serious thought. I hoped there would be more measures in this Bill that would reflect a better industrial policy to allow for the fact that as other countries lower their rates to those of Ireland, it will have an knock-on effect on our competitiveness. The argument is whether the writing is on the wall for the corporation tax rate with regard to its competitiveness. There is no argument with the fact that it must be retained. The point I am making is whether we need to shift our industrial policy to reflect our reliance on foreign direct investment and whether we should more aggressively target new markets for exports. I am sure this is something to which the Minister will return.  Section 30 provides for a new exit tax that applies to people taking assets out of the jurisdiction and out of the EU. It is arguable that this new measure has not been adequately explained by the Government. It transposes Article 5 of the ATAD into Irish law. We had an exit tax for individuals that was charged at the capital gains tax rate of 33%. Apparently, this closed a certain tax loophole that was being exploited. This will now be superseded by the new tax, although there is still a measure to block the tax loophole. As I understand it, and, again, I seek clarification, the new tax will be levied at 12.5%, which is the corporation tax rate, rather than 33% but the rate of 33% will apply if the measure is used for tax avoidance purposes. How easy will it be to identify a tax avoidance purpose? This will be quite difficult. What is happening is that when assets are moved abroad, including intellectual property, we are taxing unrealised capital gains. Why not tax them at capital gains tax rates? Granted, there is no sale and, therefore, no realised capital gain, which poses cash flow issues, but the asset or wealth gain in monetary terms is the same as for a realised gain. It has just not been crystalised. Why tax it at a lower rate?  With regard to excise, the definition of a sugar-sweetened drink has been expanded. With regard to the added 50 cents on a pack of 20 cigarettes, the price of cigarettes is now typically between €12 and €13. This might not do much to deter committed smokers but it does help deter younger people from starting the habit. There is an argument for ramping it up further but it is regressive in respect of those on lower incomes who are addicted. The Healthy Ireland survey found that about 22% of Irish adults are smokers, 18% smoke on a daily basis and 4% smoke occasionally. This still translates to about 830,000 smokers in Ireland. It is quite a significant figure. The price of cigarettes is only one part of a broader campaign to help people quit smoking. We acknowledge the HSE's QUIT helpline, plain packets and warning labels on cigarettes but is the pricing mechanism actually working or has it reached its limit? Does it have a higher proportionate cost with regard to poorer people?  There is another angle to this that is slightly obtuse but I will put it on the record anyway. Will Brexit bring about the potential for smuggling? If the UK moves to a mechanism whereby it has control over its VAT rate and levies 0% VAT on cigarettes, will we see a return to the duty-free cigarette regime we saw in the past? If the Minister has time, could he address that and whether there is a plan for that scenario? We would like to hear more.  In respect of betting duty, our proposal to lower the costs on SME bookmakers aimed to ensure that betting duty is passed on to the consumer as only the larger firms can absorb the costs. Betting duty is currently 1% and is defined by Revenue as bets entered into by a bookmaker or remote bookmaker with persons in the State. In our alternative budget for 2019, we called for betting duty to increase by 2% to a new rate of 3% at a yield of €104 million according to Revenue's ready reckoner. The Government's budget calls for an increase in betting duty to 2% at a yield of €52 million. Betting duty was much higher in the past. It was up to 20% on turnover. Let us be clear about that; it was on turnover. The purpose of betting taxes is similar to that of excise on alcohol and tobacco, namely, a tax on "vice", a word I put in inverted commas, designed to lower the incentive for people to consume. Compared to other European countries, betting duty in Ireland is relatively low. In economic terms, taxes that are primarily designed to change behaviour rather than raise revenue-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-23T21:00:00+01:00	On behalf of the Labour Party, I support the Private Members' motion and thank the Green Party for putting it before us. It speaks to common sense. The scourge of single use plastics is a blight on our environment and landscape. There is a clear demand now among the people, as articulated by the majority of Members in the House through the motion, and a clear view that we must now move towards the elimination of single use plastics on a practical basis. If we are to give any serious consideration to the IPCC report, which we are all very familiar with at this juncture, failure to take radical and drastic action will have serious consequences for humanity. I am not given to verbosity but when one looks at the stark figures contained in the IPCC report, there is very little time in global historical terms for us to do something radical to potentially turn things around to a more positive vein. This is a practical motion to which Members have assented. We should not be fooled by the Government's intention to abstain on it or read that as Government assent. It is, as has been said by Deputy Eamon Ryan, a delaying tactic. The money message is a mechanism being used as a very blunt instrument to stunt the progress of Opposition Bills and motions in the House. We demand action on this issue now. If the majority of Members say we want to support the motion, that should, in a democratic process, give rise to action by the Government out of, at a minimum, sheer respect for the democratic process. We need radical action. We are all familiar with the idea of deposit refund schemes and all of us have seen them in operation. They work in many western European countries and are based on pragmatism and common sense. Why can we not move in a direction which seeks to speak to the issue of single use plastics? We all realise as consumers and citizens that if we do not tackle this issue, the scourge of single use plastics, particularly around our coastlines, will get worse. I speak as a sea kayaker. It is something I do as a pastime. There is nothing more beneficial than to be out on the ocean in a boat on one's own steam. It is depressing to see the amount of plastic washed up on beaches with every tide or the plastic that floats at sea when one gets out far enough. As an island nation with a proud maritime history, we need to do something to tackle it and to take leadership on this issue, if not for this generation, for future generations.  I look forward to the intervention of some of the members of the IPCC who will be before the House to address the Joint Committee on Climate Action because it will bring home to us just how stark this problem is. We need to be jolted into action. Sometimes in this House we are in a bit of a bubble and sometimes people outside the House know better what needs to happen in terms of actions. They are demand action on this issue, which is not an insurmountable one. It can be tackled with some co-operation and collaboration. The motion speaks to a pragmatic approach where we move towards an eventual phasing out of single use plastics. In the meantime, it proposes, as an intervention, the introduction of a deposit refund scheme, as is commonplace in other countries. We also need to consider investing in the establishment of glass bottling plants. Perhaps this has been spoken about already and it has certainly been spoken about previously. The idea that we become producers of glass bottles and further incentivise the constant reuse of materials is common sense. We did this before plastics became omnipresent and there is a demand for it. There are many worthwhile causes throughout Ireland now. Members of Clean Coasts Ballynamona in east Cork are out every weekend cleaning up beaches and doing a mighty job. What we see in that is people power. It is people and communities coming together across the generations, not radical action. They want to be able to walk on pristine beaches again. They want to ensure that water quality is of a certain standard. It brings me to the issue of banning microplastics, on which I have a Bill that has reached Committee Stage. The relevant committee has analysed the microplastics Bill.I am waiting for a money message on it too. We cannot have more stalling tactics on these issues. I acknowledge the fact that the Green Party first brought through the microplastics Bill, on which we took up the cudgel, and that we are waiting for the Government to publish its Bill. I know that there is a Bill in gestation, which I welcome, but we want to see it published in order that we can all examine it. If we do not ban microplastics, I do not need to tell Deputies or anybody watching what the consequences of the constant presence of microplastics in marine life are, or what the consequences ultimately will be for humans. One does not have to go too far to witness the insidious damage microplastics and other plastics cause to flora and fauna such as birds.  We have an opportunity to pass a motion in this House, but it will be meaningless as a motion if it is not followed by action. There is a willingness on the part of this House, and every Deputy, to try to bring about radical change in our attitudes to plastics and to try to legislate for changes in human behaviour in a practical way.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-23T22:00:00+01:00	In the context of taxation, the imposition of increased betting duty could have an unintended consequence. Large chains of betting shops are able to absorb betting duty through a reduction in profit rather than passing the cost to consumers and some can cross-subsidise it through their online profits. For the information of the officials who are with the Minister of State, an examination of the accounts of a small betting shop over a two-year period show that it will have a betting duty liability of over €340,000 for each year, an amount that significantly greater than its profit margin. An unintended consequence of the increase, if it is not passed on directly to the consumer, is that the smaller outlets will suffer but the bigger operators will quite easily absorb it into their cost base. I ask that this be addressed or that there be an indication by the Government regarding how the measure will work because we must try to speak for the smaller, independent high-street outlets, particularly the intergenerational or family interests which are rapidly going out of business because their cost base is increasing dramatically. Section 51 looks a little like a sop to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. Some €320,000 of an inheritance will now be tax free, up from €310,000, at an annual cost of €8.1 million. If the extra €10,000 were taxable at 33% under capital acquisitions tax, this would yield €3,333 per transaction. Dividing the €8.1 million annual cost by that €3,333 yield per transaction indicates that approximately 2,430 people will benefit annually from this tax cut. One can bet that these individuals are in the top tiers of society in terms of income and wealth. It will not be ordinary people who will benefit from this measure but, rather, those who have real wealth. On capital acquisitions tax, section 50 seems to deal with tax avoidance such that people with a beneficial interest in a dwelling held by a trust will not be able to avail of a tax exemption on inheritance tax. It would be good to know more about that provision. Is there routine tax avoidance by wealthy individuals who own multiple properties and set up such discretionary trusts to avoid their children being subject to inheritance or gift taxes? I would like to hear more on this proposal.
