SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If the original REPS plan was an agri-environment measure, why is it necessary to do away with the scheme and reintroduce an agri-environment measure which will have the same aims?  Why did the Minister not refer to biodiversity?  It will be argued the scheme was used as a supplementary income measure in some cases.  The scheme's closure will result in more applicants for farm assist, which is already happening in some areas.  Considering the biodiversity measures already contained under the existing scheme and its success, it seems illogical that a new scheme needs to be introduced when the old scheme could be continued.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Will the new scheme — we can call it the agri-environment measure for the time being — be administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  What was the average pay out to farmers under REPS?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	There is too much consultation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is fine.  I am used to that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked this question, given that Teagasc's procedures and operations have already been reviewed.  I do not doubt that the recommendations will be implemented.  However, the McCarthy report states that there is scope for reducing Teagasc's staff numbers by a minimum of 250 in the short term by rationalisation of agricultural colleges and locations, reducing lower priority advisory and research activities, reducing administration and advisory services, the latter by 50%, reducing education and training functions by 30% and 20%, respectively, by 2011 and reviewing the network of offices.If the economy is to get back on its feet, the research, administrative and support services provided by Teagasc will be necessary to ensure people operating in the rural economy have the advantage they require.  I strongly suggest that the Minister of State should defend the services operated by Teagasc, particularly scientific research where McCarthy proposes that all research should be codified in one body.  This will not necessarily assist in agricultural or agribusiness-related research and this should be revised and reviewed.With regard to those people who are employed by Teagasc in the agricultural colleges, a question arises about their future if this report is implemented.  I agree there is a budgetary process in train but I ask that this area be defended.  If it is not defended, and we see post-budget in 2009 and 2010 a further reduction or diminution in the services operated by Teagasc, it will have untold consequences for the rural economy which we will not stand over.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I tabled a question on the public service numbers and expenditure programme.  This report was sanctioned by Government and makes specific recommendations.  When I ask about these specific recommendations, with all due respect to those Ministers, I get blasé, bland answers about the wonderful role of Teagasc.  My questions are pertinent to what is in the report.  I want to know whether those services will be defended; I do not want an answer that hides behind the budgetary process which is still a long way off.  We want definitive answers.  I ask those questions on behalf of those people who live in rural Ireland, who live beyond the so-called Pale, and who depend on these services.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Agriculture Council will meet next week.  Will that meeting give rise to a new regulation regarding a CMO, common market organisation, for milk or dairy, or will the status quo remain for political intervention in the market, given that there is a slight increase in the price and a slight recovery at present?  Is the strategy within the European Union to do nothing at present?  It is possible a logical strategy would be to wait to see if there will be a further recovery, or will there be further intervention?  I did not quite understand the Minister’s original reply.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Environmental measures, such as water management, will become more prevalent under the CAP in future.  The question concerns the administrative functions.  There is a suggestion afoot that we will move from pillar one to pillar two and that, instead of direct payments to farmers for management of the economy, it will be administered through various local organisations.  That danger is there, so the question needs to be addressed.  It may not be a real fear, but it is something that needs to be addressed.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that in the first instance.Second, as regards carbon reduction, at some stage there will have to be an internal debate between the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, as to whether methane reduction will become an issue if the process of carbon reduction becomes part of the CAP regime.  The climate change agenda is also on the cards, given the forthcoming UN conference in Copenhagen in December.  How will we get to a situation where we do not compromise production or market share, while meeting future demands for food, as well as other targets?  There will be an internal battle within the Government on that issue.  It is something that will arise in the context of the CAP.  I would like to get an opinion from the Minister on these questions.
