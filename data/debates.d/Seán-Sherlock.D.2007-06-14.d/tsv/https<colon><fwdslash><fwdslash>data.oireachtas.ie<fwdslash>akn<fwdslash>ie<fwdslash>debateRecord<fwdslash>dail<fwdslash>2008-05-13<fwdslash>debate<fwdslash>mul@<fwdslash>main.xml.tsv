SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I note the Taoiseach's use of the expression "departmental silos", which is new to me.  The legislative silo, as it pertains to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is fairly empty.  The legislative programme features three Bills for the Department, one of which is the animal health and welfare Bill.  I have been inundated recently——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I ask for a little latitude.  I am coming to the question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have been inundated with correspondence from representatives of Compassion in World Farming on the defeated Fur Farming (Prohibition) Bill 2004, which was, I understand, introduced by the Green Party during the previous Government's term in office.  Will the relevant provision feature in the animal health and welfare Bill?  When will the legislation come before the House?On the scarcity of global food supplies, given the lack of Government initiatives in this area, it would be pertinent to have a debate on the issue.
