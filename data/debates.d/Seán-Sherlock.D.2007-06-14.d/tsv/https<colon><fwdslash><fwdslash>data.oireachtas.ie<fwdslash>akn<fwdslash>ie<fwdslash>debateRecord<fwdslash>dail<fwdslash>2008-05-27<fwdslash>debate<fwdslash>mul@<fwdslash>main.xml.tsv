[<p eid="para_451">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to contribute.  I am a regular user of the Mallow to Dublin service and I rely on it greatly.  It is perhaps a credit to Iarnród Éireann in some respects that it has rolled out a fairly extensive service.  However, credit is also due to the existing drivers on those routes.  Some of these drivers have eaten considerably into their holiday time over the past 12 months because of the shortage of drivers and were refused leave in some instances when they sought and gave notice for leave for family occasions like confirmation or first holy communion.</p>, <p eid="para_452">While we agree this is an unofficial strike — I particularly welcome the fact that the LRC machinery is now kicking in and I hope that both sides will come to a compromise on this — there needs to be a roll-out of the drivers as promised.  If that can be expedited so that the service is resumed and the existing drivers are not put under increasing pressure that should be done.</p>, <p eid="para_453">There are two sides to this Iarnród Éireann story.  I hope it will come to a successful conclusion.  Some drivers have been very flexible in their approach with Iarnród Éireann and have been more than willing to accede to its wishes in terms of practices.  I hope Iarnród Éireann will reciprocate in kind.</p>]
