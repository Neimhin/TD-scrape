SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:00:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister, who is appearing before us at short notice but with potential solutions. I am seeking a greater degree of clarity around the programme support payment of €1,500. I wish to show the Minister examples whereby, notwithstanding the process that providers have been through, in particular providers of long standing who have always been compliant and whose risk profiles have not increased, providers who are today able to get insurance are being told that the cost will increase twofold in one instance, fourfold in another and sixfold in another with which I am familiar. Notwithstanding everything that the Minister is saying and the exit from the market of a certain insurance operator, even where providers' risk profiles have not increased because they have always been compliant as per Child and Family Agency and HSE regulations, their premia costs are increasing. One is left with the impression that the insurance companies are taking advantage of the lacuna in the market by stepping in to profit from the challenge facing providers. How will the programme support payment be divided? Is it a one-off payment for every provider? What formula will be used? Under what heading will it be done? Will it be deemed a supplementary payment to meet the cost of overheads? Will it be a direct grant just by dint of the fact that someone is a provider? Is it the case that providers can benefit without having to go through a rigorous process? The Minister will be conscious of the fact that many providers will benefit from the time extension, but as public representatives, we are all conscious that the capital costs incurred by providers to become compliant and continue their operations have put them into debt.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:00:00+00:00	We should not overburden the sector to the extent where facilities are being forced to close because their capital and insurance costs are too high and the €1,500 payment is not enough to meet the challenges they face.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:00:00+00:00	The Minister has stated that, by 28 December, the process will have been gone through.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:00:00+00:00	I fail to understand how the Minister is going to get through a process where the childcare providers that I represent can interact with Pobal or the county childcare committee to benefit from this grant by-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00	So it is not an application process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00	Then there is the issue of the current insurance model-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00	-----and the need to address the fact that people have received quotes with twofold, fourfold or sixfold increases, as in the three examples to which I can speak.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00	With respect, what the Minister stated does not give any comfort to those providers. There are also those people who have yet to be registered up to June. What can they derive from the process to which the Minister refers?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00	Did the Minister say 30%?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:40:00+00:00	A provider who is not a member of Early Childhood Ireland paid €550 last year and is now being quoted €2,100. She will pay only €1,500 if she pays €245 to Early Childhood Ireland, but the risk profile of someone who is a member of Early Childhood Ireland does not increase or decrease.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-18T16:40:00+00:00	The Government has skin in the game because the Minister partly funds Early Childhood Ireland. Therefore I believe she has some muscle in this regard with the insurance companies.
