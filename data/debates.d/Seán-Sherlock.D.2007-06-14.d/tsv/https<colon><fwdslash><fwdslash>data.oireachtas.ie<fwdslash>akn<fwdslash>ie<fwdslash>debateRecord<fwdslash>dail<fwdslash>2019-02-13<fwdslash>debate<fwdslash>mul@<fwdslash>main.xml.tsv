[<p eid="para_109">Will the Minister outline whether burial sites allied to former institutions are being examined for the purpose of possible further investigations? This is in the context of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and in the light of the speech that the Minister made to the Seanad on 6 February, when she indicated that the commission plans to deliver a substantial report on the burial arrangements for persons who died while resident in the institutions by 15 March 2019. She went on to state that the commission's assessment of burial arrangements at other major institutions is also being considered. What is the state of play <i>vis-à-vis </i>other institutions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_113">I welcome the Minister's reply and acknowledge that the commission has captured the personal experiences of more than 500 people, as the Minister noted in her speech in the Seanad. I ask her to be a little more specific about other institutions, if possible. Can I deduce from the Minister's reply that other former institutions are being examined, and that there will be a report to that effect? The Tuam site is well documented and a process is under way. Can we expect a process in respect of other parts of the country?</p>]
[<p eid="para_116">In that case, we can assume unambiguously that no geophysical testing of Bessborough has thus far taken place but that if the need arises, such testing will take place. Can a decision on that be expected when the report is published, or is the Minister, in consultation with her Cabinet colleagues, taking steps in the interim to have geophysical testing done at the site?</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">I could go around the houses in north Cork - and in east Cork for that matter- but I will not do so. Does the Minister anticipate that the €9 million allocation will actually be used up? Will those funds be fully taken up?</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">The Minister has not visited Cork since she was appointed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_158">May I ask a brief supplementary question on that subject?</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">We have to acknowledge that the Minister is giving the House some signal here that if the report makes an adjudication or finding in respect of Bessborough, there will be an action there and she will consult her Cabinet colleagues. I would be grateful if the Minister would reiterate on the record of the House, given her bona fides in respect of Tuam, that the same set of principles will apply in respect of Bessborough.</p>]
[<p eid="para_162">To Bessborough?</p>]
