SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:40:00+00:00	I was hoping that the witnesses would come before us today with a very clear, metric-driven response to each of the points which were raised in the HIQA report. These points are addressed in quite general terms in the witnesses' statement, but I was hoping that we would be able to go through the six standards with which there was moderate non-compliance, for instance, and that the witnesses would lay out a very clear timeline as to what actions were being taken to address that non-compliance and when they would be completed. I would also like the witnesses to address the two standards with which there was major non-compliance. I am hopeful that the witnesses can come back to us with a very clear, definitive action plan as to when those actions will be completed. I will start with something which is a little bit outside of what has gone before. There was a major incident on the campus in August 2016. There was a fire. The dates of the announced inspections in the HIQA report range from 27 March to 30 March. In that report it is stated that there was moderate non-compliance in respect of standard 9 - premises, safety and security. For instance, "Staff were found to have inconsistent responses with regard to the procedure to be followed in the event of a fire." The report identifies that doors were of varying sizes and, in respect of national standards, "Appropriate annual inspection and testing certificates were not available to demonstrate that the emergency lighting system was in compliance with the appropriate standard." Notwithstanding the positivity of what the witnesses have presented to the committee regarding deconstruction of some of the cultural, staff and managerial practices and the fact that they are engaged in a process to try to rectify many of these issues, by any fair analysis there is a long way to go if there was a fire in August 2016 and in March 2017, a good number of months later, HIQA was still identifying deficiencies in respect of something as simple as fire safety. That is the first point the witnesses might address. The second point relates to the recent High Court judgment against Oberstown in which the judge clearly stated that there was a limited breach - and I emphasise the word "limited" - of constitutional rights in respect of deprivation of physical exercise; loss of contact with families; lack of procedural safeguards relating to the imposition of separate and associated deprivations, particularly the formal written recording of decisions; and regarding imposition of the separation regime. As I understand it, and I would like the witnesses' perspective, this case was taken by four people. It related to a specific incident or incidents which took place in August 2016. Is Oberstown Children Detention Campus still breaching the constitutional rights of citizens - children and young adults - in respect of separation and associated deprivations, particularly in respect of the formal written recording of decisions? Is it still breaching these rights or has it rectified the matter in the intervening period? I am not a lawyer, but the HIQA report of March 2017 would clearly suggest that there was major non-compliance in respect of standard 2 and that "Some children spent long periods of time in single separation and the reasons for this were not always clearly recorded." I suggest that, notwithstanding the positivity in the witnesses' embracing of cultural and managerial change in a real and meaningful way, the witnesses still have not dealt with these issues satisfactorily. These are simple issues which can be dealt with without expenditure of major resources and within a short timeframe. When will the witnesses satisfy the committee, the Minister, and the users and staff of this service that this will be rectified?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:40:00+00:00	For the record, in respect of the witnesses being cautious in their response, the High Court judgment is a matter of public record.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:40:00+00:00	Is the witness saying the issue has been addressed?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:40:00+00:00	The principle is simple.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Bergin.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	I am happy to help Mr. Bergin to understand where I am coming from.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	How many reviews of Oberstown have been carried out over the years? How many reviews have there been in the past five years, for example? I will accept an approximate figure.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	I apologise for interrupting. I asked a very specific question. How many reviews have taken place?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	Okay. That has been over a period of a year. I would say that by any operational standard, if five reviews were carried out internally or externally it would set off some kind of signal or alarm to the effect that action needs to be taken in a short timeframe.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	I have a final question. Is the management structure flat or hierarchical? Are there any comparable management structures in the public sector? Does it mirror the structure in the Prison Service, the Civil Service or the public service? Is it the case that there is a director and a deputy director with a management team underneath them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	Mr. Bergin did not answer Deputy Neville's question about the number of agency staff.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	What is the turnover of staff?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	Okay. I would like to ask about the culture in Oberstown.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	Yes. I thank the Chairman for his forbearance. I am very grateful. Can an individual employee feel comfortable in addressing an issue that he or she might have directly to Mr. Bergin, or is there a line of command through which such a person has to go?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	Okay.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-08T12:50:00+00:00	That might seem obvious, but it is a very important point for us in terms of our understanding.
