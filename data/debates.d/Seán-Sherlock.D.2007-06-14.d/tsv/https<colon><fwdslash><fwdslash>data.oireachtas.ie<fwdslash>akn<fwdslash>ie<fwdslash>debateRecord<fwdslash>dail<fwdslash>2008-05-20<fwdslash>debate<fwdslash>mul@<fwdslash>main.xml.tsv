[<p eid="para_178">On behalf of my party I join in congratulating the Minister on his appointment and also the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.</p>, <p eid="para_179">The reason for the question is the degree of uncertainty which is having a marked result in this country in that we are now paying more for food.  Families are paying much more for staple items and that gives rise to the question.  If the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted, that will have a further uncertainty for food production throughout the European Union into the future.  Many people are asking whether the Government has a coherent policy.  Irish farmers and food producers will be asking whether that €8.6 billion in exports will be compromised in any way if global trends continue as they are.  We are trying to elicit whether, notwithstanding the CAP health check and the FAO agenda on a global basis, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has a coherent strategy on the way forward for Irish producers to attain some degree of self-sufficiency — and ensure we take a long-term view on food production in Ireland.  That is the premise of the question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_183">Does the Minister acknowledge that if the WTO deal goes through as it is constituted at present, this will have a further adverse effect for producers in developing countries — as well as for Irish producers?  Ultimately, and this harks back to what the Fine Gael spokesman is saying as regards the current WTO deal, there are political considerations, both domestically and internationally.  Irish farmers want to hear that there will be no dismantling of the long-term achievements of CAP into the future.  It is clearly the case that the WTO deal, as it stands, will compromise those gains and indeed, diminish and destroy them.  They want to hear a firm voice from the Government as to its intentions on the WTO deal.</p>]
[<p eid="para_309">I refer to the Malone report and the basis of the five hectare limit.  Is this over-prescriptive and is there scope for further reductions in this regard?  A ministerial prerogative is available to reduce it further, if necessary, in certain locations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_322">As with any regime change, one would hope there are plans for <i>force majeure</i> events.  This has been ten years in the making.</p>, <p eid="para_323">I welcome the clear statement and, frankly, I hope it is true.  This legislation was on the Order Paper when I came into this House, then it was taken off and it has appeared again.  The confusion relating to this is genuine and, from the point of view of a spokesperson on agriculture, there has been no legislation on agriculture, fisheries, forestry or food in the past 12 months.  For this reason I hope the statement is genuine and I look forward to the legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_342">I do not wish to be parochial but this matter relates to the offices in north Cork, specifically Mallow, where structural issues have existed for some time that make it difficult for staff to process grants claims.  I want to raise this with the Minister while we are on the subject.</p>]
