[<p eid="para_47">I wish to address the staffing quotient assigned to the high level group from the various Departments and ask if enough staff have been assigned to the task at hand.  If the target is a reduction of 25% by 2012, it would appear there are not enough staff to deal with it adequately to move the agenda forward.  I am concerned that it is not moving as quickly as it might.  Given that this process started in 1999 and has been through two transitions and that we are in an economic downturn, there is a serious urgency about this because of the cost implications for business.  There may not have been the same urgency about this two or three years ago.  It is necessary to ensure an adequate staffing quotient.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">Information gathering places a major cost burden on businesses. Obviously the CSO has certain obligations by dint of EU legislation and that, I presume, is what is meant by an intractable issue, as mentioned.  I am sure that the business groups, the SFA and ISME have referred to this specifically in this committee.  If that is an intractable issue and there a pre-existing regulatory burden, the question arises as to whether the CSO is an active partner on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis with the high level group to ensure that burden is reduced.  Is there a practical relationship there?</p>]
[<p eid="para_54">On what quantitative or qualitative analysis is it based or what is the underlying assumption?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">That is fair enough.  The employers representatives might have a view on that which I am sure we will get to as we progress.  In trying to achieve a 25% reduction, is it possible to quantify at this stage the percentage achieved on the work programme?  Has 50%, 70% or 80% of the work programme been achieved?  Will the CSO hit its targets in terms of reducing the burden?  Could the timescale potentially move out again?  I would like to get a sense of where it is at and whether the targets are being achieved.  I have the work programme here. I have a specific question on the Health and Safety Authority.  From a HSA perspective, how is the regulatory burden being reduced in terms of the wealth of health and safety legislation impacting on business?  What actions are being taken to reduce that burden on businesses?  I can speak with more authority from a local authority perspective whereby the simple issue of filling a pothole now requires a myriad of man hours.  I assume the same is applicable in a business sense in that if one wants to carry out works to one's premises or whatever there is a regulatory burden on businesses.  Are the representatives teasing out those issues also with the HSE?</p>]
[<p eid="para_61">Does Mr. Gorman have a timeline for the completion of that process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_118">Mr. Gorman will have to forgive me if my understanding of the information obligations provided to us is incorrect.  On health and safety, let us take IO/20, risk assessments, and IO/13, safety statements.  The administrative costs associated with these were €167 million for the former and €146 million for the latter.  As a percentage of the overall burden, these amounted to 51% and 44%, respectively.  How, in practical terms, is it proposed to reduce the burden of these two areas by 25% by the end of 2012?  I am sceptical about the possibility that the Health and Safety Authority will be hauled over the coals and legislation amended by the end of 2012.</p>, <p eid="para_119">I do not get a sense of urgency, which is the reason I questioned the staffing quotient applied to this mechanism in the first instance.  Mr. Gorman alluded to a parliamentary question I tabled recently.  The secretariat for the high level group is provided by the company law review group and business regulation section, which currently have a staff of eight.  The high level group cannot achieve what it hopes to deliver with this staffing quotient, notwithstanding the fact that other Departments feed into the process.</p>, <p eid="para_120">I will now address Mr. MacFeely, the representative of the Central Statistics Office.  Business interests are making a case that one could take representative samples as opposed to complete figures to reduce the regulatory burden.  The Legislature requires a greater sense of urgency in this regard given the current economic circumstances.  We need a substantive means of identifying, at a minimum on a quarterly basis, whether the targets are being met.  In the work programme some of the targets are characterised by the colours red, orange and green.  I will choose a random example.  The description given on the Companies Registration Office and Revenue annual returns is that the CRO and Revenue are working together to find ways to reduce duplication.  It refers to milestones completion co-ordination meetings between the CRO and Revenue and then it is given a green light, and then that an information note has been produced by the CRO to help companies which wish to change their ARDs and can be found in paragraph 7.  How does a company alter its ARD?</p>, <p eid="para_121">Presumably, that is real and that has happened.  However, there is so much more within those work programme documents which are totally aspirational.  I am the type of person who likes to see a target date and an action and whether or not it has been achieved, and much of it has not been achieved.</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">The bottom line is that it is not an apportioning of blame either; it is an apportioning of resources.</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">How often does Mr. Gorman chat to the Minister?</p>]
[<p eid="para_161">We are discussing reducing a cost burden, particularly in the context of the fact that risk assessments cost €167 million and safety statements cost almost €146 million.  No one is opposed to the idea of reducing the legislative burden or the need to ensure that workplaces are safe.  No one in his or her right mind would seek to compromise on that.  However, an entire industry has grown up around health and safety and the implementation of legislation relating thereto.  The regulatory regime relating to the HSA and similar bodies has mushroomed in recent years.  Representatives from the HSA came before the committee and I invite our guests to consider the figures they provided in respect of accommodation costs alone.</p>, <p eid="para_162">We are trying to examine matters such as those to which I refer.  I do not believe what we are doing in this regard is wrong.  Nor is it wrong for us to try to change or streamline the position in any way.  No member is trying to reduce the need for proper assessment but a common-sense approach should be taken.</p>]
