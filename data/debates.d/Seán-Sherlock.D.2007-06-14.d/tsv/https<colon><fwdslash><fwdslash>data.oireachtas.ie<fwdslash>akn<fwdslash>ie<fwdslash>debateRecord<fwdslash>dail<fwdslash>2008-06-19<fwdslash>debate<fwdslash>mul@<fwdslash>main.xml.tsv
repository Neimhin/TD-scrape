[<p eid="para_5">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to ask the Minister for Health and Children why Mallow General Hospital does not yet have a CT scanner that is operational, despite the budgetary provision being made in 2004 and despite its subsequent installation; to ask why the person who was appointed radiographer will not now take up the post; and, further, to ask the Minister for Health and Children when it is proposed that this post will be filled.</p>]

[<p eid="para_815">I propose to share time with Deputies Tommy Broughan and Brendan Howlin, if I may.</p>, <p eid="para_816">I received the same e-mail as Deputy Creed and I believe it has summed up the situation as it relates to a family that is completely reliant on fishing for its livelihood.  A husband and wife re-mortgaged a house to invest in a boat, employ a crew of five people and take to the seas.  In one instance, it spent ten days, or 240 hours, at sea for a return of €725 per man before tax.  Basically, they were earning €3 per hour.  Moreover, the same fishermen then are obliged to incur the stringent regulations applied by the authorities in Ireland, while French, Spanish and fishermen from other countries are looking on and laughing at the regime here.</p>, <p eid="para_817">This pertains to realising that a group of people exists within our society who, because of climactic and bureaucratic conditions, incur serious losses of income.  However, they wish to sustain their livelihoods and their coastal communities because they have done so for generations.  As the lady who wrote the e-mail stated, when they hit bad times they want a leg up and not a handout.  Moreover, they do not wish to incur the bureaucratic nightmare that relates to fisheries policy.  However, they want to see put in place a realistic mechanism that would assist them through, if one pardons the pun, choppy waters.  During times when crewmen and women are not bringing in catches and their incomes are being seriously depleted — they are deemed to be self-employed —  they should not be obliged to go cap in hand to the local community welfare officer to beg to supplement their income.  A form of tax incentive or tax break could be put in place on the basis they are sustaining communities in coastal regions.  Moreover, the Government should consider a form of social welfare mechanism to assist such men and women on the basis that their income fluctuates between one end of the year and the other, that would not necessarily be breaking EU direct aid rules.</p>, <p eid="para_818">I ask the Chair to let me know when I have spoken for four minutes.  I am anxious about the other Members——</p>]
[<p eid="para_820">In his contribution, the Minister of State told Members about the saga of illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing and that the Luxembourg meeting will take place on 23 June.  Is the European Union serious about tackling the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing?  Short of stating and acknowledging the problem, is the Government going into that meeting with a serious view on this problem?  It seems it is costing Irish and other European Union fishermen billions of euro annually because of the international nature of the problem.  This matter must be taken up at the WTO.  It must be taken up seriously at Irish level because it is taking food from the mouths of fishermen and is having an impact on a sector of our economy and society that could do very well, were this problem targeted in an effective manner.</p>]
