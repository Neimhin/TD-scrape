[<p eid="para_124">I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 114 together.</p>, <p eid="para_125"> The questions presume a possible future investigation by the European Commission. My Department has had no contact from the Commission in respect of such an investigation. I am aware that the Commission commenced an investigation on state aid to Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus in 2007. The State's response was co-ordinated by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and my Department supplied any information to that Department as required by the Commission. The State has maintained that the operation and administration of public service obligation transport services and the school transport scheme, respectively, are in accordance with the provisions of EU law. A decision on the investigation is awaited.</p>]
[<p eid="para_128">We can look into the publication of the report to which the Deputy referred. I hope that answers her question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_130">I am sure the Deputy will recall that during her time as a Minister of State, a value for money report was published on this matter. It was decided that we would continue on in the manner envisaged, in other words, that the relationship with Bus Éireann would continue. The Deputy will also be aware of a recent High Court case which focused on the nature of the arrangements between the Department and Bus Éireann. The essential thrust of that legal action was to seek an order from the High Court setting aside the existing arrangements for the provision of national school transport services. That was before the commercial High Court for a six day period. The court found comprehensively in favour of the Department and costs were awarded to the Department. The matter is now the subject of a Supreme Court appeal. To answer the Deputy's question, a value for money report was carried out on this matter and I do not envisage that the policy will be revisited at this point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_165">It will be in spite of Deputy Dooley.</p>]
