SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-05-07T15:30:00+01:00	I thank the Senator for proposing this amendment. To be fair to the Government side, we addressed many of those questions on Second Stage and given that this is Committee Stage, I will begin by giving the rationale for section 5 and then give a brief overview of some of the issues raised by the Senator. Section 5 provides for a very significant change to the Friendly Societies Act 1896, that is, the cessation of registration of any new societies under this legislation. Only a few societies, 47, remain in existence. There have been only three new entrants in the past nine years giving a clear indication that the friendly society model is no longer favoured by newly establishing organisations. The current legislation does not provide for prudential supervision of friendly societies by any public authority. This is a source of some concern in that there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public and I consider that it is in the public interest to restrict the operation of new entities in this area. That is the justification for section 5. Furthermore, certain limitations are already being placed on the activities and functioning of friendly societies by other bodies of legislation. For example, the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 introduced restrictions on new bodies registering for the purpose of the provision of health insurance, that is, no new bodies may register as restricted membership undertakings; the Charities Act 2009 introduces a new charities regulatory authority and registration requirements to which several of the benevolent type societies may be subject; and the Consumer Credit Act 1995 brings a small number of societies under the supervision of the Central Bank for loans purposes. I assure the Senator that there is no disadvantage foreseen to any would-be societies in that they can register, either under the Industrial and Provident Societies or the Companies Acts, in both instances with the added protection of body corporate status. The Friendly Societies Acts do not confer full corporate status on societies or limited liability on members. The evidence in recent years is that this has become common practice for many charities and clubs which register as limited companies. This change will mean in effect that the friendly society model will continue only as a closed group of societies, that is, the existing societies will continue in operation but no new societies will be permitted to establish. The Central Bank regulates savings, loan and insurance activities carried out by entities involved in the provision of financial services with a view to protecting the financial interests of members of the public doing business with the provider of the financial services but not where these activities are carried out by friendly societies. This is a source of some concern to the Government in that there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public and we consider that it is in the public interest to restrict the operation of new entities in this area. There is no expertise in this area in the registry of friendly societies and no existing legal basis for such supervision and it would not be practical given the number of societies involved to develop a supervisory regime within the registration of a friendly society, RFS. The most realistic institutional option for introducing an appropriate system of supervision is the Central Bank, which is at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight and has a responsibility to provide, in a fully integrated and co-ordinated manner, for the prudential supervision and stability of all types of financial service within the financial system as a whole. To avoid the possibility of other bodies moving into this unregulated space, it was decided to close registrations to new friendly societies. I hope that addresses the concerns raised by the Senator in his amendment. Only a few societies, some 47, remain in existence. There have been only three new entrants in the past nine years and that must indicate that newly-establishing organisations no longer favour the friendly society model. We strongly believe no new societies may register in the future as friendly societies.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-07T15:40:00+01:00	I thank the Senator for his comments. The Senator is effectively opposing the proposal to prohibit the establishment of new loan funds where a society does not currently operate a loan fund, and the Government does not agree that this section should be omitted. Section 6 places a restriction on existing societies establishing a loan fund as provided for in section 46 of the principal Friendly Societies Act 1896 where they do not already have such a fund in place. This change will not impact existing societies which currently have a fund in place. As I mentioned previously, such activity is not subject to prudential supervision by any public authority, and whereas the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010, in amending the Consumer Credit Act 1995, bring a small number of societies under the supervision of the Central Bank for loan purposes, I am of the opinion that societies not already active in this field should not be permitted to extend their remit. It is very important from a consumer protection view that the provision of loans to individuals should be a regulated activity. It is not desirable that societies should be in the business of making loans without reasonable protections being afforded to the individuals accepting the loans, and this is generally accepted by societies themselves, as only three of the 47 currently operate loan funds. The section effectively provides that where a friendly society does not at the time of the passing of this Bill operate a loan fund as provided under section 46 of the Friendly Societies Act 1896, such a society may not establish a loan fund after the coming into operation of the Bill. It does not affect the operation of an existing society currently operating a loan fund.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-07T15:40:00+01:00	The Senator mentioned the supervisory regime or lack thereof. Nobody in these Houses of the Oireachtas would disagree with the Senator's critique of the lack of supervision.There is no question or ambiguity about that but for the purposes of the Bill it is important to note that we are seeking to move to a situation whereby one recognises the 47 that are in existence and those that have loan funds, but one ensures that the changes to the legislation are being made as a preliminary step in the process of establishing a system of the most appropriate supervision of certain existing societies, especially operating in the area of financial service provision. That is the ethos under which we are trying to introduce the legislation. It is intended that the group of societies would be subject to Central Bank supervision and that this would be the closed group. I accept the points made by the Senator. I do not think anybody in the House would disagree with him on his critique of the system up to now but what we are seeking to do is to ensure the system is fit for purpose, notwithstanding the fact that these friendly societies go back to the 19th century and there is a particular ethos around them. The Senator speaks to my own geographical area of north Cork. I remember names such as Nora Herlihy and Horace Plunkett among others that are synonymous with movements such as this. We do not seek to lose sight of that either but what we want to do is ensure we have an appropriate model for the 21st century and that is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-07T15:50:00+01:00	Section 11 provides for the removal of the requirement for societies to submit at least once in every three years a return to the members and their holdings to the registrar. It is known as the triennial return. The co-operative sector has sought the abolition of the requirement and argue that the information is out of date too quickly to be useful, and imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on societies. There is general agreement that the return serves no useful purpose and, accordingly, it is proposed to remove the requirement. The removal of the requirement is balanced by the provision in section 10(g) for a right for non-members to inspect the books containing the names of members and their holdings in shares at the registered office of the society. Members already have a similar right. This section is modelled on the like section in the Companies Acts. Information is therefore available to both members and non-members on a current information basis, which would render the triennial return unnecessary. Section 11 relates to the industrial and provident societies, that is, co-operatives and societies that are not friendly societies.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-05-07T15:50:00+01:00	As the Acting Chairman said, the amendment is a consequential amendment to the proposed insertion of a new section 16 which will require a renumbering of sections. It is a technical amendment. The revised text will eventually read “Sections 16 to 24” when the new section is added but under the new legislative workbench system used by the Bills Office the renumbering takes place only when all the amendments and sections have been voted.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-07T15:50:00+01:00	Again, it is a technical amendment advised by the Attorney General’s office to align the text with the similar phrase used in section 14.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-07T15:50:00+01:00	The amendment does not change the substantive meaning of the section as currently drafted but is made on the advice of the Attorney General to improve the clarity of the section. The new section 24 replaces the existing section 24.
