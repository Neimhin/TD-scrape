[<p eid="para_800">There are two Sinn Féins on this island - Sinn Féin in the Six Counties and Sinn Féin in the Twenty-six Counties. They preach one message in the South and another in the North. I do not understand Sinn Féin's vehement opposition to a property tax in the South, as it does not appear to oppose it in the North where it is in government and where the average household pays approximately £1,000 per annum. If Sinn Féin is so vehemently opposed to property tax, why has it not rolled back on that tax in the North?</p>, <p eid="para_801"> In October, Sinn Féin nodded through the Welfare Reform Bill in the North, which will have the effect of permanently reducing the North's £5.1 billion benefits bill.</p>, <p eid="para_802">I do not understand why Sinn Féin did not block that in the North, as it is in the Executive.</p>]
[<p eid="para_804">I thought I had one minute.</p>]
