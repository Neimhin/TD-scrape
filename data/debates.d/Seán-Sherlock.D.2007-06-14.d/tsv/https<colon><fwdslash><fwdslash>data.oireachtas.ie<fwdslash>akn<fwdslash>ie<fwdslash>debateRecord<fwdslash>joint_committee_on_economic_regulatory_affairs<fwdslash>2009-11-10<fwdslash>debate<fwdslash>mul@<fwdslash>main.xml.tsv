SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the delegation to the committee.  It is extraordinary that there has been such a shift in the language from the Irish Banking Federation.  We are now into the language of corporate governance and corporate social responsibility, trust, regulation and regaining of trust.  It is as if there has been a sea change in terms of attitudes within the banking sector.  If the story on the ground is to be believed, it would appear that for real people who bank in this country there has been absolutely no change whatsoever in the culture and that the small businesses and the like continue to be squeezed.  Why is it that the banks are cutting off credit to small businesses?  It is impossible to get figures.  If I line up 100 people, small businesses, I can guarantee that at least 60% to 70% will say there has been a surreptitious squeezing of their credit lines.  There is no question about that and one cannot deny it.  I ask the Irish Banking Federation to come clean about it and state why it is doing it, how long it will continue and give some degree of transparency to that notion.I listened carefully to what the witnesses said about the difference between the consumer mandate and the prudential mandate in terms of supervision.  They said that the consumer mandate was prioritised over prudential supervision.  To my mind, that is another way of hanging the pre-existing regulator out to dry.  I do not believe for one moment that the witnesses cared one jot about the whole regulatory regime in this country in recent years because, metaphorically speaking, you were all like pigs at a trough making potloads of money and the whole regulatory regime did not exist.  I remain to be convinced as to whether the witnesses are genuine when they say they will buy into the new European regulatory framework.  We will all watch Brussels and the position of the Irish Banking Federation and its lobbying arm at the European table on whether it will buy into new supervisory EU rules.  It remains to be seen whether it is genuine in that regard.I wish to ask about the SPV again because I did not quite understand the answer given by the Irish Banking Federation.  Is it that the witnesses do not fully understand the nature of the SPV as it relates to NAMA or that they have not been given any direction from the Government as to whether the banks could be investors in the private segment of that particular vehicle?  Will they clarify their understanding of the SPV at present?  If they say they are not sure how it will pan out, then it beggars belief to a layman like me that a chief executive of the Irish Banking Federation would come before an Oireachtas committee and state that.In regard to the mutually acceptable arrangement or the formal agreement with MABS, will the Irish Banking Federation and the banks in this country take an active, fiduciary stake to ensure that MABS will be able to operate at an efficient level?  The reason I ask that question is that the people who approach me with mortgage difficulties, whom I refer to MABS, have to wait three, four or five weeks to get an appointment.  MABS is currently at the pin of its collar.  I am sceptical when I hear bankers saying they are now working with MABS as active stakeholders in seeking to ease the burden for people who find themselves in financial difficulty.  If the witnesses tell me there is formal agreement there I will take that in good faith.  If the banks are about to become active stakeholders in the MABS process — I realise we are talking about a State body — by lending personnel or making a financial contribution, I welcome that.  However, I would like an expansion of the explanation to determine the qualitative nature of the relationship.Mr. Farrell stated that there had been 21 repossessions, but how many applications for repossession have the banks made?  There is a difference between the number of repossessions in a particular year and the number of applications made.  For example, if the bank was about to repossess my house tomorrow morning, the chances are that I would go to see my bank manager on an informal basis and we would seek to work things out.  The distinction between applications and actual repossession must be made.  This is related to the announcement today about the six-month grace period for mortgage holders who cannot meet their payments.  I give credit to the federation for stating it would extend that period beyond six months if necessary.  However, unless it is put on a statutory basis, the level of trust in the banks may be a bit sketchy.  We remain doubtful.I would like to see a shift in corporate social responsibility.  I am a customer of a bank and my relationship with the bank on a local level is quite a good one which, like all customers, I have built over time.  However, for many people at the moment it seems to be a one-way street.  I do not think customers feel, necessarily, that the banking regime is working in their favour in assisting them, their own customers, in getting out of the difficulties they are in.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What are the percentages in that regard?  Mr. Farrell is saying he is sure some applications are being treated in certain ways.  Is he saying there are lines of credit extended to people who should not have them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I would like some clarification on that.  Is Mr. Farrell stating that the Irish Banking Federation supports the current European Commission proposal without qualification?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If Mr. Farrell answers the question about the number of applications for repossession I am sure Mr. O'Regan can tell me how many of those people were referred to MABS in the first instance before IBF members made those applications.  I am not being disingenuous about this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Perhaps Mr. O'Regan might answer my question on the number of applications for repossession.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If Mr. O'Regan can say that definitively then he can give me the numbers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	My colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, will speak in greater detail on this.  We are trying to establish how it might be possible to ease the burden for mortgage holders who find themselves suddenly unemployed.  Given what we have read about the banking sector and the goings on in recent years I must have a sense that I can go back to my constituents in Cork East and tell them with some degree of confidence that if they find themselves in trouble with their mortgage there is a good chance the new six-month regime will work.  Because of the level of mistrust of the banking sector at present there are still questions about that process and whether it will work if it is not put on a statutory footing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is all back office work.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It does not have a trading floor in Dublin.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With all due respect, you work for that company.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I would like to respond to that for fear my remarks are misinterpreted.  I am very mindful of the fact that we need to protect jobs in the financial services sector, I worked in that sector.  I am concerned about the damage that has been done to our international reputation by practices in the banking sector.  That is where I am coming from.
