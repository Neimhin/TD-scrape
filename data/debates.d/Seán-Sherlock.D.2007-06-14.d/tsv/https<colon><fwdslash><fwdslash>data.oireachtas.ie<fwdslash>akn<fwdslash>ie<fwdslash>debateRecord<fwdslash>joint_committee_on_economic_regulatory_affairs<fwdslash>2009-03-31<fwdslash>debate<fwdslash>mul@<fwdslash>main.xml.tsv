SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the delegation.  I am a layman.  I am not an accountant and do not have any qualification in that regard.  If I was reading the statement which the authority has made about issuing requests for information, explanations and clarification in respect of 84 of the reports reviewed and that there was amended financial information in respect of 50% of reports, I would be thinking that the culture of compliance in this country is still a long way off target in respect of certain financial institutions.  I seek clarification because perhaps I misunderstood these statements.  If I understand correctly what Mr. Drennan is saying, that it was because certain ISA standards were not met to the full letter of the law, my view as a layman is that I think there is still something rotten in the state of Denmark, so to speak, in terms of the culture of compliance and that people are still not providing or fully disclosing proper financial information or meeting the required standards.I refer to the European Commission's recommendation on quality assurance of auditors.  If this is a Commission recommendation, to what extent should it have been transposed into Irish law?  To what extent is the Government responsible for that transposition?  I ask for an opinion from the delegation as to what constitutes a recommendation in terms of transposition into Irish law and what constitutes a regulation as laid down by the European Communities in terms of the quality assurance of auditors of public interest entities as that speaks volumes about the culture in this country where quite often laws, recommendations or regulations that are supposed to be transposed to assist the culture of compliance are not transposed in the manner in which they should be.  This may be something on which the chief executive is not in a position to make a comment but I am sure the Senator may be in such a position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is fair to say a large proportion of the mess in terms of compliance is partly due to a lack of political action in enforcing EU recommendations and regulations.  It is very easy to blame the culture of regulation, but the Government must also take responsibility for its actions or inaction.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It would be.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To go off on a slight but nonetheless relevant tangent, is the authority willing to make the legal advice it has received available to the committee?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is correct.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The reason I ask is that the committee, as a body, could seek certain powers, theoretically, in relation to compellability.  A number of things would need to happen for that to come about, but it could be helpful in order to assist the committee in terms of the questions we pose to people who come before it.  In the event of such people asserting that what they say is confirmed by legal advice, if that is made available to us, it might be of assistance to us in some instances.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is understandable.
