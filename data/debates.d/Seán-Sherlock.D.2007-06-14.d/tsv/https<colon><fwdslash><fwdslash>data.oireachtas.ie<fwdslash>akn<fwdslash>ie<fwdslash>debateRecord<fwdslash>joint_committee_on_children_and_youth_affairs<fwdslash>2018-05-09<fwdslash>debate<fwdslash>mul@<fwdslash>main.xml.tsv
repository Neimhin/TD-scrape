[<p eid="para_67">Does Mr. Elliot mean in the context of safeguarding?</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">Yes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_75">I thank the Chairman for his generosity.</p>]
[<p eid="para_110">I do not know where to start because I am flabbergasted at some of the evidence that has been presented to us. I want to gain a deeper understanding of the distinction between governance and safeguarding issues. There will be some repetition in the delegates' answers. Mr. Ian Elliott has been appointed to look at a sample of between 500 and 600 cases in which safeguarding issues arise, dating back to 2003. Is that correct?</p>]
[<p eid="para_112">There is a box of files on all of the cases somewhere within the bowels of Scouting Ireland. Is that what the delegates are telling us? We are talking about paper files.</p>]
[<p eid="para_114">The Garda, Tusla and all of the relevant agencies-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_116">The CEO has been in office since 2012. Has he been involved in any of the safeguarding cases since his appointment?</p>]
[<p eid="para_118">That is not what I am asking about. My question is specific. Has the CEO been involved directly between both parties - the complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been made?</p>]
[<p eid="para_120">Therefore, Dr. Lawlor has been directly involved in specific cases as CEO.</p>]
[<p eid="para_122">In normal circumstances is it appropriate for the CEO to be directly involved in safeguarding cases?</p>]
[<p eid="para_124">Yes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_126">I am looking for help to understand this issue. It is probably awkward to ask Mr. Elliot the question when the CEO is sitting beside him, but the CEO has brought in Mr. Elliot to do a job and I will proceed on that basis. There are a number of sample cases on file during the tenure of the CEO and Mr. Elliot is going through an internal process, albeit with an external consultant. I have dealt with him in the past on the Cloyne report. Historically, we have had much engagement on the national board for safeguarding children in the Catholic Church. Had it not been for him, the Cloyne report would never have seen the light of day. We did a great deal of work on it and I appreciate the work he has done in safeguarding children. However, I have a difficulty in understanding why, for instance, if an investigation is ongoing into a sample number of files during the CEO's tenure, the board and the CEO have not stepped aside from the process and the investigation has not become a fully external process on the basis that there is considerable taxpayer funding at play and there is a massive disparity between the ordinary experiences of the leader of a scout troop and the children and those who operate in the upper echelons of the organisation. This speaks to the issue of governance to which I will come shortly. Should the entire board and leadership step aside while the process is ongoing and should somebody else step in to act as an honest broker in order that everybody can have confidence in the process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_128">That is the safeguarding element, about which there are further questions. However, the Minister suddenly announced the appointment of Ms Jillian van Turnhout, a former Oireachtas Member. I still do not have a proper understanding of what her role will be. She is the Minister's appointee, but what will she do exactly? What is Mr. Elliot's interpretation of her role in this process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_131">Is it Mr. Burbridge's understanding Ms van Turnhout does not yet have a sense of what her role will be? Did she articulate that to him?</p>]
[<p eid="para_133">This is an issue because, as a committee, we are still in the dark. Last week in the DÃ¡il I asked a question about Scouting Ireland, but I am still none the wiser about what Ms van Turnhout's role will be.</p>]
[<p eid="para_135">I do not need them. I will continue with my questioning.</p>]
[<p eid="para_137">I appreciate that, but it would be good to have Scouting Ireland's perspective. As yet, there has been no articulation of or contact on the terms of reference and how the investigation, whatever it will entail, will proceed. We are, therefore, still a little in the dark in that sense. </p>, <p eid="para_138"> I refer again to the issue of governance. Reference was made to a new board of directors. Dr. Lawlor is subjecting himself to an internal process to appoint a new board of directors to reflect the new realities in which he finds himself. That is not an appropriate way in which to proceed and he should subject the board's governance procedures to an external review, whether it is the van Turnhout review or another. </p>, <p eid="para_139"> I refer to the public, individual scout leaders, scouts, cubs and volunteers, in particular.</p>, <p eid="para_140">How are they going to be confident, if they are not fully confident at present, that the new board of directors has clean hands and will result in a new culture with stronger and more robust governance procedures? I have questions about whether there have been documented complaints made by volunteers - this is adult scout leaders - against members of the board, right up to CEO level, or other staff, or whether there have been allegations of bullying, for instance. Have reports been commissioned by Scouting Ireland to examine complaints and the mechanisms by which it can resolve those complaints in a mediated fashion? Have the reports been published and have they been provided, for instance, to all parties involved? Those are just some of the questions that are still on our minds, which have not been presented to us here as representatives of taxpayers' interests in relation to the submissions today. We do not know if there are any legal cases open against the organisation by volunteers for alleged harassment, for instance. If we are talking about change management and if it is a change management structure from within and the board is hoping to bring all of these people with it, I suggest that it does not necessarily have the confidence of a lot of people in the organisation on the ground. I am a layman in this regard but my perception is that what the board is trying to do is to give effect to change internally and trying to manage it internally using the same people and the same resources.</p>]
[<p eid="para_143">The witnesses do not have to answer the question if they do not want to.</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">In the interests of transparency, it is in everybody's interest that the witnesses are as forthcoming as possible with this committee because the answers and the truth will out ultimately on these processes anyway.</p>]
[<p eid="para_148">Who is managing that process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_150">Mr. Burbridge should forgive my ignorance, but he is honorary vice president of Scouting Ireland and the team lead on this crisis and he is also managing the change management.</p>]
[<p eid="para_155">I am only getting warmed up.</p>]
[<p eid="para_157">I appreciate that answer because at least it gives me some knowledge that this is subject to some sort of external tyre-kicking, if one wants to call it that. What the volunteers need is some signalling from the upper echelons that change management is going on because they are floored by what is going on at present. They were not too happy at the fact that Scouting Ireland did not come before the committee sooner because it created a very bad perception. That said, I appreciate the fact that Scouting Ireland is here today. I did ask whether there are internal reports on complaints. Are there internal complaints about bullying and harassment? I think that is a fair question. It can be answered. I do not think there is a legal impediment to it being answered. First I am trying to establish whether there are complaints of bullying within the organisation or complaints by volunteers or individual scout leaders and, second, that a process is under way to deal with them in a robust fashion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_161">I am trying to understand the process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_163">Could I ask for a little bit of indulgence, just for two minutes?</p>]
[<p eid="para_165">Deputy Mitchell has nodded in affirmation of my request.</p>]
[<p eid="para_167">I appreciate that. The Chairman took a fair amount of time himself. I will wrap it up, so to speak. Are there live cases of bullying and harassment? Does Dr. Lawlor as CEO deal directly with those cases or is there a process under way where a staff member deals with the case?</p>]
[<p eid="para_169">Has Dr. Lawlor dealt with cases?</p>]
