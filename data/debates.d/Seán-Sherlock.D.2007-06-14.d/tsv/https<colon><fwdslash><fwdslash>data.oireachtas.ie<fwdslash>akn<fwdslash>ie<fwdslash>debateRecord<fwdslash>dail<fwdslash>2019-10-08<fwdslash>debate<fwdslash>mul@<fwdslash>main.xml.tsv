There are many people who are not on the medical card scheme and wish to give up smoking through the use of alternative sources of nicotine as they wean themselves off the product. However, the cost of these products is excessive. I ask the Minister to consider reviewing the cost of those products for which pharmaceutical companies are charging an arm and a leg.
