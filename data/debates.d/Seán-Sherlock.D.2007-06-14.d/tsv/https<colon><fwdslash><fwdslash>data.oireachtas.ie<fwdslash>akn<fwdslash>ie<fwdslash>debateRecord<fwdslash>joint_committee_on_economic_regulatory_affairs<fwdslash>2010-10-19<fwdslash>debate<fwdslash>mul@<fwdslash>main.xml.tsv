[<p eid="para_39">I welcome Ms Doyle and her colleague to the committee.  What is the surplus income this year and for what is it being used?  Was part of the surplus income used to produce the booklet presented before this committee today?  I received a copy of the proposals and the presentation by e-mail and do not understand, therefore, given the times we are in, how anybody could justify a spend on an elaborate, glossy presentation such as the one we have here.  I do not want to sound â€˜holier than thou' about it, but we are all attuned to electronic media and I find this ridiculous.</p>, <p eid="para_40">Ms Doyle stated an "equilibrium" of 25,811 licences had been reached.  How did she ascertain we have reached an equilibrium level, particularly when countless numbers of taxi drivers say there is over supply of licences in the market?  She acknowledged that between 2005 and 2008 real income reduced by 5% and says there has been a further reduction since 2008.  I represent a constituency with an urban rural mix, and given the number of taxi drivers who approach me with queries as to how they can obtain supplementary welfare income from the Department of Social Protection in lieu of income they are no longer earning, I suggest the reduction in income is far more stark than 5% or whatever the current figure is on reduction in earnings.  The key issue is that taxi drivers with a licence are no longer making a living out of their licences.  If I was to speak for drivers in smaller towns like Mallow, Mitchelstown and Fermoy, I would suggest there is an over-supply of licences within regional areas outside of the larger metropolitan areas and that the drivers are not able to make a living.  Perhaps the point is that it is not their divine right to earn a living from taxi driving, but if there were some control or greater control over the number of licences issued full-time drivers who are trying to put food on the table might be able to make some kind of living without having to supplement their income with income from the Department of Social Protection.  What are the delegates' views on this?</p>, <p eid="para_41">I understand the Competition Authority will have a separate view on licence numbers and competition but I fail to see how the Taxi Regulator can say we have reached equilibrium.  I hope I did not misunderstand the regulator in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_42">Reference was made to regulatory impact analyses.  What is involved in the regulatory impact analysis of 25,000 licences in terms of the ability of the drivers to make a living?  Is the latter factored in?  The regulator stated she had carried out studies on real earnings.  If so, she is considering sociological aspects or the economic cost of having an over-supply of licences or a set supply of licences.  Did the regulatory impact analysis take into account the qualitative cost to individual licensees of having so many licences in the market at present?</p>, <p eid="para_43">I acknowledge we are experiencing an economic downturn and that there may be a downturn in business between Thursday to Saturday night.  In my town, Mallow, for instance, 40 or 50 licence holders ply for trade on a relatively small rank on a Thursday afternoon.  It is ridiculous and not sustainable.  Where does one draw the line?  Does one continue to say that any applicant who fulfils all the criteria should get a licence or does one say that a town such as Mallow has enough licences and that no more should be issued?  This applies to every town of Mallow's size.</p>]
[<p eid="para_47">Was it printed externally?  How much did it cost?</p>]
[<p eid="para_53">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">Ms Doyle stated the regulatory impact is control over numbers through the establishment of rules to modify behaviour.  The Taxi Regulator will continue to regulate the industry.  Although there is a dip in numbers at present, they will probably increase in the longer term.  Something will have to give at some stage.  The current number is not sustainable.  Nobody wanted a closed shop in the taxi industry.  While there should be equilibrium between supply and demand, the regulator is referring to a false equilibrium because the number of drivers is not the optimum.  Bearing in mind geographical variations, the dogs in the street know there are too many licences.  People will say anecdotally one can get a taxi in Dublin at 4 a.m. on a Saturday and that one might not have been able to do so previously, but one must ask how this can be balanced with the over-supply in towns such as Mallow, Tralee and Killarney.  There are drivers fighting each other for spaces on the main street.  This Government and the next will have to take that into account.  Surely the regulator will have to make a statement or adopt some position on supply and over-supply.</p>]
