SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:30:00+01:00	Has the Tánaiste faith in the Policing Authority? It is a simple question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	If the Tánaiste has faith in the Policing Authority and if she has known about this since June 2016, why did she leave it until yesterday, according to her statement, to meet Josephine Feehily, the chair of the authority, to state that she was formally referring these issues to her under the Garda Síochána Act?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	What I am trying to understand is the internal dynamic that exists between the Tánaiste, the Garda Commissioner, the Garda Inspectorate and the Policing Authority. People watching these proceedings will question why the Policing Authority issued a statement today that states: The Authority again expressed its disappointment at not being advised in a timely manner that an audit into the breath test issues was underway. Despite questioning over several months, the Authority has not [...] been provided with the full internal reports or indeed a clear sense of how these matters have been handled to date within the Garda Síochána or the status and content of the audits which have been undertaken. The Authority considered the correspondence received from the Garda Commissioner on Friday 24 March last in which the Commissioner requested that the Authority refer a number of matters to the Garda Inspectorate.What I am trying to get at is the reason the Policing Authority would issue a statement of this nature. One can only surmise, and I ask the Tánaiste to correct me if I am wrong, that the Government does not have enough faith in the Policing Authority due to its not engaging in a more timely fashion with the Department regarding the modalities of the issue at hand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	I ask the Tánaiste to correct me then.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	Whose obligation was that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	I have limited time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	This speaks to the heart of the culture of management in An Garda Síochána. Again, there is an inherent weakness in this regard. There should have been an obligation on the part of An Garda Síochána, surely, to inform the Policing Authority in a timely fashion. Does the Tánaiste agree with that statement?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	This is very serious.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	Yes, but, a Cheann Comhairle-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-28T18:40:00+01:00	I appreciate that. We can no longer keep giving An Garda Síochána mismanagement political cover. Decisions must be taken as to how the force is managed. I understand the predicament in which the Tánaiste finds herself, but we need to hear about concrete actions from her. Given that we have a Garda Inspectorate, a Policing Authority and a Department of Justice and Equality, when can we expect to see a root-and-branch change, and why does an external service need to do this when we have two State entities already? There are quite a number of quite sensible recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate report. We should now see the implementation of these and a political willingness to do so. Those are the messages we need to hear in this House because the people outside these walls, with every new scandal that emerges, are losing faith in policing in this country. In the short time available to me, I refer again to the Tánaiste's statement that there will be some remedy for those who were incorrectly convicted. I wish to quote directly from her full written speech again. It states, "Letters will begin issuing to these individuals on 3 April." It also states, "All of these cases will be appealed by An Garda Síochána in order to ensure that the courts set aside these convictions, all fines will be reimbursed and penalties removed, and all of those affected will be contacted directly by An Garda Síochána." She states definitively that these convictions will be overturned. What further remedies, if any, are open to these people who, in certain circumstances, may feel as if their good names were tarnished in having to appear before judges in district courts, potentially on unsound convictions? Will there be further remedies besides the issuing of the letters and the revocation of the fines so that those affected might have their good names restored?
