SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-10-24T13:40:00+01:00	It was fruitful for the committee to engage with RTÃ‰ on the issue. The orchestras may not have had an outlet within the Oireachtas. It proves the value of the petition received from Ms Joyce, for which I thank her. I thank Senator Horkan for attending.
