SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Bill allows Coillte to increase its requirement significantly.  In that light, the amount of time designated for the Bill is far too short.  We need a proper and lengthy debate on the nature and workings of Coillte.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the same issue, what credence does this House give to an Ombudsman's report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If we do not respond to the Ombudsman's report, it would be a dereliction of duty.  It is right and proper that this House give some time to debating the issue at least.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	She is very expensive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I find myself in a ludicrous situation in that I must thank Deputy Creed for allowing me some of his time.  If I may, I will allow some of my time to Deputy Ferris, with whom I was to share my time.  Why do we find ourselves in circumstances where I have merely two or three minutes to discuss a princely sum that could potentially amount to €400 million?I do not have adequate time to discuss the fact that the CEO of Coillte is being paid over €400,000 at a time when the subsidiaries under Coillte are completely under-performing, nor do I have time to analyse properly the Minister of State's speech, in which he states €1.89 billion, or just under 1% of GDP, is attributed to forestry.  That figure is from 2008 but it will be reduced significantly in the future given that the subsidiaries are under-performing.  I wanted time to discuss this in greater detail.I also wanted to discuss the fact that the Forest Stewardship Council audited Coillte in 2006 and that this is not mentioned in the Minister of State's speech.  The results of the audit cast a poor light on some of Coillte's practices that are worthy of consideration in respect of this Bill.  I wanted to discuss the fact that Coillte is currently being audited by the Forest Stewardship Council.  Will the Minister expound on that process?If there is time, I will allow some to Deputy Ferris.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Bill seeks the permission of the House to afford to Coillte the opportunity to increase its statutory borrowing requirement from €101.5 million to €400 million.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister of State pointed out that inflation alone would allow an increase in the borrowing limit to €182.5 million.  This is based on inflating the €101.5 million limit in 1988 by Ireland's inflation rate up to October 2009.  Will the Minister of State give us a more detailed analysis of that assertion?  Coillte's borrowings to the end of 1988 are €161.2 million and it has approval to borrow up to €260 million under sections 24(1) and (2) of the Forestry Act 1988.The Minister of State gave a good overview of Coillte's workings, the direction it wants to take in corporate planning and the working groups established to review its operations.  There was no mention, however, of the pensions deficit, a fundamental aspect of the company's operations, or the chief executive officer's and the board's remunerations.  There are also questions surrounding a Forestry Stewardship Council report which indicted some aspects of Coillte's operations.  The Labour Party would be reluctant to support any mechanism to allow for an increase in a company's borrowing requirements unless there is some degree of transparency in its operations.  The Minister of State's Second Stage speech did not sufficiently address these matters.The company's reports and accounts also do not address these issues.  When Coillte attended the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in October, one got the impression everything was rosy in the garden.  There were, however, some difficulties for ancillary firms such as Mediate and others with the downturn in the construction industry and this was reflected in their results.  What is the future for these firms?  I do not see enough reporting back to this House on how these operations will proceed and their individual financial positions.  Is the new borrowing requirement to facilitate any of these offshoot companies?  What will the nature of their financial position be as a result of this amending legislation?  Before the House is requested to up Coillte's borrowing requirement, it requires more information as to how it does business.People tend to look favourably on Coillte's operations because of the recreational and amenity value of its work.  I have benefited from them myself in the Ballyhouras and there is a certain pride in how Coillte has developed amenities well.  With the Copenhagen summit agenda, there is the political consideration of the role of forestry in reducing or offsetting CO2 emissions.  Will the increase in permissible borrowing go towards facilitating this process?  If so, will Coillte have a significant role in that process?I would also like the Minister of State to address the issue of the role of the Forestry Stewardship Council.  It is hoped, given the 2006 report and the audit under way, that there would be significant improvement in corporate social responsibility and the role of corporate governance in respect of how Coillte performs its functions.  Fundamentally, we need a little more transparency in regard to the operations of Coillte.  While we all believe that it is a force to do good, there are aspects of its operation which, from time to time, leave doubts in one's mind.  Were the agency to be a little more transparent there would be a great deal more goodwill towards measures such as this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to the issue of inflation, the 1988 Act and the Minister's response to questions put.  My understanding of the Forestry Act 1988 is that at any one time the aggregate borrowings of the company should not exceed £80 million or €101.5 million in today's money.  The Minister of State stated borrowings had reached €182.5 million in October 2009 and that this is accounted for by inflation.  Perhaps I misunderstood the legislation or I am naive but my understanding is the figures set out in the 1988 Act are finite and definitive and that there is no allowance for inflation within the 1988 Act.  Perhaps my interpretation is wrong and, if so, I will stand corrected.  If borrowings increased beyond the limit at any time between 1988 and 2009 there should have been an amendment to the 1988 Act to facilitate such a change long before now.  The importance of the point is that if the Minister of State allowed for inflation or if such a measure were not in the 1988 Act, then the Government should have amended the legislation long before now and this raises a question over any borrowings in excess of €101.5 million in the intervening period.  Will the Minister of State clarify this for my satisfaction and understanding?I refer to the Fine Gael amendment, which is reasonable because the tone of the debate from the Opposition side of the House has been such to ensure Coillte is subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny.  As we stated, Coillte was before the committee and there was no mention of potential for increasing its borrowing requirement at that stage.  That throws up a question about the role of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  When witnesses from the semi-State sector report to the committee, are they obliged, in the interests of transparency, to let members know what their strategic requirements are, particularly with regard to borrowing?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that.Questions regarding the remuneration of the chief executive officer and other high-ranking staff were not answered adequately by the Minister of State.  There is a question mark over whether the borrowings are for the purposes of remuneration or to meet deficits in the pension.  I understand the Minister of State said this would be dealt with in further legislation but it is also pertinent to this Bill, in particular, to the amendment put down by Fine Gael and supported by the Labour Party.
