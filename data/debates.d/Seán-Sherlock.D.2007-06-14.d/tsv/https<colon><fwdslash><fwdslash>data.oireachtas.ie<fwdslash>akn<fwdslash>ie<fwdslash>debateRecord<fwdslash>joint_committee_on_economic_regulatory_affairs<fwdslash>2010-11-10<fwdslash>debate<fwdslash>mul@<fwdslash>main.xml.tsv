SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I welcome Professor Honohan and his colleagues to the committee.  It is good we are having this frank and open discussion.Professor Honohan referred to burdensome mortgage debt, the buy-to-let category and the policy challenges arising from this.  Will he give a more unambiguous view as to how active policy interventions can assist those ordinary mortgage holders at risk of defaulting?  While I understand the points about capital adequacy ratios and the 5% write-off provision, the language used in describing this problem should be less abstract and provide some comfort for those mortgage holders pinned to their collars.David McWilliams and others have posited the notion of debt forgiveness for mortgage holders.  Is that a tenable proposal?  Has the Central Bank information on private banks' bad debt provisions for residential mortgages?  Is there an oversight mechanism in place for the various stages of default from a mortgagee moving to interest-only payments to actual arrears?A report in last week's edition of The Sunday Tribune stated the European Central Bank holds €18 billion in Irish sovereign bonds, 20% of the total debt.  For how long more will it keep purchasing Irish debt?  Are we wholly reliant on it now?We are trying to get a picture of how austerity measures and achieving growth will help get us out of the economic morass in which we find ourselves.  It goes back to the language used in these discussions which is often suitably vague.  I will have to go back and read some of Professor Honohan's answers three times to interpret them and read between the lines.  Clear and unambiguous statements on the economy are needed not just for the committee but also for the wider audience.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Somebody needs to lighten the mood.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We hope Professor Honohan will not take him literally in dealing with these questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The households, yes, and we need to drill down to that level.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I appreciate that response.  What about the purchase of €18 billion in Irish sovereign bonds?
