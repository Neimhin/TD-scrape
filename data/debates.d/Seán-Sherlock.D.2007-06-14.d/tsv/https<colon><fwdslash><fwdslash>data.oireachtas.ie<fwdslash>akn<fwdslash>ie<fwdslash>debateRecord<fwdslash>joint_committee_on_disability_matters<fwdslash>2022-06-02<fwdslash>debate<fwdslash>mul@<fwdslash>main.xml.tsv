SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	I welcome this meeting and the witnesses coming before us. Starting with the individual family support plans, I had a parliamentary question on this issue answered by Mr. O'Regan. It was dated 24 May 2022. In that question, I asked the Minister of Health the number of individualised family service plans issued and accepted by each CDNT, broken down by CHO area. The response I got was that the individual family support plan process is a live one, in that the team and family keep it under review while service supports and strategies are being implemented and as the needs and achievements of the child and family change. Is the output of the individual family support plans being measured as this process is being rolled out? Where I am going with this question is towards trying to get at the experience of the family that interfaces with the service.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	On this same issue, we have now created another bolt-on aspect to the experiences of the family and the child. The experiences of families of which I am aware, whether we like it or not, reflect a lack of confidence in the service. Families are afraid that they are being sent down yet another road and to another service that they must sign up to get access to services. I am not going to be rhetorical. I just ask the HSE to be mindful of this point and if it can do that, it would be good. We know what the experiences of families are. We all know they are jaded now. Let us take that as a given. We all accept that. If I dovetail the individual family support plan process now with the creation of the CDNTs, then this is again about measurement. Turning to Ms O'Neill, another parliamentary question I submitted asked "the number of children that have been transferred from Children's Disability Network Team back to primary care on foot of assessments since April 2021, by age, CHO and LHO in tabular form and general categorisation for such a transfer back to primary care operations". Ms O'Neill's response to me stated, "Though there is no specific timeline on when the system will be available, I can confirm that there has been a procurement process and the system is now at the development stage." Again, we do not have a live measurement of the families' experience as they are going through the system. They are again being asked to sign up to a CDNT process and they are wondering how many more arguably bureaucratic processes they will have to go through before they can get access to the speech and language therapist, SLT, the occupational therapist, OT, the psychologist and all the therapy services. Do the witnesses appreciate where I am coming from in this regard? We must ensure that parents and children are minded in this context. The bottom line in all of this is still access to the services, notwithstanding all the issues we are talking about here concerning recruitment, which is, effectively, the big elephant in the room. I just want to hear from witnesses from the HSE that they are going to be careful and mindful of families in this process. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	I am happy for Ms O'Neill to answer because she replied with the letter responding to my parliamentary question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	I will keep moving on because I am conscious of time. Do we know how many therapists, by their designation as SLTs and OTs, have left the CDNTs since January 2022? If we know the answer to that question, do we know if those people have been replaced? What is the status of the individual files? I ask this because, again, we have the child interfacing with a service, and he or she has already started to do so in these cases. One person who was a part of delivering that service then leaves, for all sorts of appropriate reasons, and, suddenly, that child and the family are left in limbo. They do not know where they stand. I will ask my fourth question and then I will be done. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	Can I ask my final question?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T10:50:00+01:00	My last question concerns the section 39 organisations. If I am reading Mr. Reid and the Minister of State correctly concerning the need to address the imbalance here on the pay parity side, there is a responsibility, and I say this respectfully, on the Government to engage with the trade unions and the representatives of employees to address this subject. I say this because, and the Co-Chair will attest to this, we have a facility in north County Cork, namely, St. Joseph's Foundation located at Cooleens House, and every time I submit a parliamentary question - and there is a plethora of them now - the response I get back refers to the problem of recruitment and being unable to recruit. My fear is that what has happened is that people have moved over from one service to another, because, whether people like it or not, there is this perception that there is this type of Darwinian system where the HSE has recruited and taken on people from section 38 and 39 organisations because of better terms and conditions. If we do not address this aspect, we will be at nothing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T11:10:00+01:00	Chairman, my question was not answered. I refer to the specific question I had about what happens in a CDNT when somebody leaves and there is a live file. What happens to the file? What is the legitimate expectation of the child and his or her family in respect of that file? I need an answer to that question because I have cases where that has happened. The second point I made that was not addressed was pay inequalities. Mr. Reid said he met with the section 39 organisations, I think he said specifically. I would like to know what the nature of those discussions were and whether the issue of pay parity and equality of pay came up. There is an elephant in the room here. I referenced St. Joseph's Foundation but it is one of many service providers where the same thing is happening, namely, they cannot open services and they remain closed because the providers cannot recruit. I am being told they cannot because they are competing with the HSE. I would like to hear from Mr. Reid about how the HSE intends to grasp the nettle on that one and where the Minister of State is then as far as ensuring we have parity is concerned. Deputy Tully was here earlier and opened up with that very point. We need to address that point. I would like some response from-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-06-02T11:10:00+01:00	What about my question on the files? I am not going to let that one go.
