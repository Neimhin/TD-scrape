SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:30:00+01:00	I would like to address all my questions to Mr. Devine only. Can Mr. Devine please help me to understand what a variation is? I have six minutes so let us not have any plámás.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:30:00+01:00	The variation would be made at the behest of the project director. Is that the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:30:00+01:00	Is it at the behest of the design team?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Mr. Devine have answered the question and I thank him. It is not the main contractor making the variation, it is the board making the variation that gives rise to the claim. I would like a "Yes" or "No" answer. I am trying to understand this correctly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	I thank Mr. Devine.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	So who is the employer's representative in this process?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	The architect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Help me out here. The architect is the designer of the project from day one but the architect is also the arbiter in respect of the decisions on claims. Is this correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	In broad terms I am correct in what I am saying.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Mr. Devine is saying an independent person is built in but it is still the architect and it is still coming from the project board side. That is the point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	That is fine. There are 906 claims notified under clause 10.3 for determination by the employer's representative. Mr. Devine has sent us the document on the 10.3 clause and there are six subheadings. People will be able to interpret them quite easily. If I understand it correctly what the witnesses have stated today is the value of those 906 claims is now approximately €446 million. Is that correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	There are nine disputes agreed and no longer in dispute management to the value of €2.9 million.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	That is correct.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	We do not have the main contractor or any of the subcontractors before us. We do not have the mechanical, electrical or lift contractors before us. We have to take everything Mr. Devine is saying at face value. I am trying to dig a little bit deeper on this. It seems to me the claims arise from variations made. Notwithstanding the line, which is well co-ordinated, that has been put forward to us today by the Department of Health and Mr. Gunning that external costs will drive this project well beyond whatever figure is to be determined and well beyond the initial costs and the stated public cost, there is also the issue that the development board, and I am trying to be as objective as possible, is part of the process of driving up costs because of the variations it is making. Is this a reasonable statement to make? Effectively, the main contractor is the postbox used for any subcontracting increases or variations. The witnesses explained what a variation or claim is. Where there are such variations to the order outlined, any mechanical, electrical or lift variations have to come from the subcontractor to the main contractor through that postbox to the board. Is this correct? Do I have that right or am I wrong?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Okay.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Okay.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Is it reasonable in a normal contractual process to claim for time? Is this Mr. Devine's experience as a project director? The project is running into billions of euro at this stage. Is this normal practice?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	Mr. Gunning has spoken about an inordinate number of claims. He referred to the heat of the battle.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T10:40:00+01:00	I thank the Chair.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T11:10:00+01:00	I will go back to the 906 claims notified for ER determination under the 10.3 clause. Have we determined that the estimated cost of outstanding claims is €446 million?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T11:10:00+01:00	I am sorry. That is what the contractor is claiming. Can Mr. Devine clarify what has been settled from that €446 million?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T11:10:00+01:00	This leads me to my next question about the legal processes. This is a matter of public record so it should not be sensitive information. Can the witnesses quantify the number of proceedings that have ended up in the High Court? On how many occasions has the development board ended up in the High Court? Who has instigated those proceedings and what has been the cost to the taxpayer, ultimately, of that? That is public knowledge-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T11:10:00+01:00	It is public knowledge so please give a straight answer. It is not commercially sensitive. What are the costs so far?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-07-13T11:30:00+01:00	I have a practical, procedural question for our visit tomorrow. Will the contractors be there to meet us?
