There is so much that is in what the witnesses have said that I am finding it hard to internalise it in live stream, so to speak. It is devastatingly pertinent and, thankfully, there is a language relating to it that is coherent. I thank the witnesses for that because this is what we, as legislators, really need to hear. We are getting down to the nub of the matter. I wish to speak specifically to the Data Protection Bill. Professor O'Sullivan referred to section 29, which acts coterminously to Article 8 of the regulation. We have had before the committee entities that represent the rights of children state with goodwill and solid bona fides that the digital age of consent should be retained or legislated for at 13. Professor O'Sullivan makes the point that there is a distinction to be made between the article and the legislation. In other words - and this is what I want clarification on - is he saying that the article is not about a child's general capacity to enter into a contract?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T14:20:00+00:00	Indeed. That is where I need clarity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T14:20:00+00:00	I have researched this matter and discovered that under the law of contract in Irish common law which has not been updated or consolidated recently, a minor does not have full capacity to contract. I shall quote the antiquated language used in the law of contract in Irish common law. It states:Where necessaries are sold and delivered to a minor he must pay a reasonable price for them. Necessaries in this section are defined as meaning â€œgoods suitable to the condition in life of [a minor] ... and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and delivery".If this aspect of the law is left in place and not amended, it seems possible that a minor will have the capacity, at 13 years, to consent to the processing of his or her personal data but will not have the capacity to enter into the substantive contract in question on the grounds that it is not one for necessaries.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T14:20:00+00:00	In other words, a digital age of consent of 13 years would put us offside in our own common law system.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T14:20:00+00:00	I thank the delegation for their excellent information. Did I hear them correctly when they said - I shall paraphrase - that when a parent signs a contract to buy a phone and gives it to his or her 13-year-old, 14-year-old, 15-year-old or 16-year old and images of an adult nature are shared between boys and girls, girls and boys, etc. it constitutes-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T14:20:00+00:00	What does that constitute?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T15:00:00+00:00	Is the future dystopian or is it hopeful?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T15:30:00+00:00	On UK legislation and the point in the witnesses' submission, the UK amendment refers to high privacy settings being switched on by default. I need an explanation as to how that would work in practical terms. Ireland is one of the most innovative countries in the world and nine out of the top ten "born on the Internet" companies are here. Their European, Middle East and Asian, EMEA, headquarters are operating out of Dublin. We have the Insight Centre, a Science Foundation Ireland-funded body. We are investing significantly in big data analytics. The innovation the witnesses are talking about to crack that code could be done on the island of Ireland. We have the scientific personnel and the excellence in science to be able to do it. I want to get the witnesses' perspective on the fear I have. The top companies I referred to have commercial sensitivities and are looking for market share. My fear is that if one tries to legislate for or create the innovations to block and filter access, Mr. Facebook, CEO, or Ms Facebook, CEO, and others may ring the Taoiseach to say they do not like what we are doing in Ireland where they have made a solid commitment to their investments. The threat of pulling out could be used to push back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-13T15:30:00+00:00	That is a fair point but it is a consideration I put to the witnesses.
