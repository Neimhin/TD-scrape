[<p eid="para_16">I anticipate that there will be a presentation but I think we have already had it.  A list of the issues raised was furnished to Mr. Gunning and Mr. Egan.  I would like the committee to go straight to those issues instead of revisiting what was already said about Coillte's operations and the results for 2009.  It would make best use of our time to go to the issues if that is possible; there are at least nine that require answers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_20">Respectfully, I ask that we do as I suggested and that we go straight to the issues, adopting our normal format where any questions from spokespersons and then other members are addressed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_22">We should go straight to the questions.  Any of the issues before us on the submissions on figures will come out as the questions are answered.</p>]
[<p eid="para_25">I thank Mr. Gunning and Mr. Egan for coming before the committee a relatively short time after their last submission.  Since then, the €400 million facility was agreed by way of legislation at Christmas and the Irish Forestry Contractors Association has appeared before the committee.  There is an inherent respect for the work Coillte does, it is seen as a vital resource, but there are issues where questions can be asked, particularly about the structure for the €400 million.</p>, <p eid="para_26">On the designation of Coillte, what is the exact structure?  Is it a semi-State company, a State company or a private company?  What Department is it vested in and which Minister does it answer to?  What is its exact designation as a company?  Why did the chief executive request a €400 million credit facility for financial restructuring?  Is it because loans outstanding had to be restructured or because there are short-falls in financing arrangements?  Is there a shortfall in pension provision or is the company in financial difficulty?  We have seen the 2008 and 2009 reports and the picture for 2009 is not what the body would like it to be.  What is the extent of the difficulties?</p>, <p eid="para_27">The Irish Forestry Contractors Association appeared before us and made some serious allegations concerning the standing sales.  Mr. Christy Nolan, who appeared before us on 14 April, said that in regard to the 2010 ratio of standing sales, Coillte wants to take over most of those sales and is only putting up 40% of timber for standing sales to the mills contractors and that it is taking over more of the harvesting sales, which amounts to approximately 53%.  He stated that this will force the mill contractors to tender against Coillte contractors, who are already in dire straits.  He claimed to have been informed by the mills that Coillte has taken up to 100,000 cubic metres off the system for optimisation, which he believes is another means of getting control of more of the harvesting on its conditions.  I am not saying I agree with that but I would like to see that allegation answered by Coillte.  We want to get a true picture of where the issue of standing sales stands at present.</p>, <p eid="para_28">There is a perception that has been expressed to us that there is depletion of long-standing staff in favour of sub-contractors.  There is a perception that contractors do not have a stake in forestry management in the same way as the existing staff and, through the depletion in numbers there has been a diminution in the standards in terms of replanting, thinning and other issues.  As somebody who knows very little about forestry, I have to say that when I walk in the Ballyhouras I get a sense of depletion and that replanting is not as vigorous as it might have been.  I do not know if that is the case or reflects the rest of the country but I would like to see the point answered.</p>, <p eid="para_29">The question was also raised by Mr. Nolan about Coillte's diversification into other products and markets.  I, for one, would stand behind any company that seeks to diversify into as broad a range of areas as possible.  It is a good and healthy way to do business.  However, the idea of Coillte, which is a forestry company, diversifying into nursing homes warrants some degree of questioning.  Whether Coillte is seeking to do this to avail of tax incentives or has a clear objective to seek a return from this type of activity is open to question.  However, the perception is that there has been diversification into such a wide range of areas that it is to the detriment of the core business, and that should be addressed.  These are the issues we wanted to raise and which we wanted to give Coillte an opportunity to address.</p>]
[<p eid="para_63">With all due respect, the reason for the legislation and the technical issues around that are understood, that is, the fact that Coillte had to come back on an annual basis and seek the requirement.  At issue here is the use to which the borrowing requirement is being put, transparency in regard to why a requirement of €400 million is being sought and how that translates into pounds, shillings and pence in substantive terms.</p>]
[<p eid="para_68">Does Mr. Egan not think Coillte was ill-advised on the Medite acquisition or that it took a short-term view of the matter given the borrowing requirement of €70 million?  It appears to me the banks dictated that debt restructuring would not take place until they were satisfied that the company had an extended borrowing facility.  What banks were involved and what was the nature of the deliberations?  We have entered a new era of transparency in terms of the link between the banking sector and State companies.  If a State-owned company like Coillte seeks an extension to its borrowing requirement, we would like to know more about the nature of its relationship with the banks.</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">On a point of order, I referred to the contentions made by the Irish Forestry Contractors Association in respect of the 2010 ratio of standing sales.  The following has been alleged by the forestry contractors to this committee.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_91">Coillte wants to take over most of the standing sales and is only putting up for 40% of timber for standing sales to the mills contractors and is taking over more of the harvesting sales, which amounts to approximately 53%.  This will force the mill contractors to tender against Coillte contractors who are already in dire straits.  We have been informed by the mills that Coillte has taken up to 100,000 cu. m off the system for optimisation.</p>, <p eid="para_92">We need some concrete answers to these allegations.</p>, <p eid="para_93">I also posed a question on the relationship with the banks.  I would like to know which banks Coillte has been dealing with.  Has it had any dealings with Anglo Irish Bank?</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">Does Coillte have a legal obligation to remove refuse that is dumped illegally?  The company has reduced its staff down to a core group of about 500 employees.  This means that there is not as much of a presence and if the standing quota of staff is reduced, then the company cannot be as vigilant on forestry management and illegal dumping.  The sub-contractors will not be vigilant on behalf of Coillte in respect of illegal dumping.  There will have to be a core staff in certain sectors that will be able to police illegal dumping.  If this does not happen, we will not be able to control the tidal wave that follows.  It is getting worse in Munster and in my own region.</p>]
[<p eid="para_179">I asked a question relating to the bank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_194">On a philanthropic and very local issue, a 67 year old man living by a forest pathway in north Cork, without electricity, wanted to get an electricity connection.  He was told by Coillte he would have to pay €80,000 for that to be facilitated by the ESB.  There was toing and froing and he was subsequently told it would cost him approximately €14,000.  This is a man who has lived in the forest all his life, who, late in life has decided he wants to electrify his little holding.  He cannot pay €14,000.  If there is any way in which Coillte would see its way to facilitating this man in his autumn years he would be very grateful.  I have a note on the details that I can pass to the delegates.  It would be a major feather in Coillte's cap.</p>]
[<p eid="para_197">The ESB side is such that the situation is all squared off and it is ready to go.  Coillte is the sticking point.</p>]
