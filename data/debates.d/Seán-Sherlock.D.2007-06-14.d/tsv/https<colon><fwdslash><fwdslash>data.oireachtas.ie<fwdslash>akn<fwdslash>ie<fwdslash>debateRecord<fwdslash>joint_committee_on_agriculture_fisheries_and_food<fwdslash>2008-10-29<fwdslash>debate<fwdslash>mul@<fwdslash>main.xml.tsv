[<p eid="para_59">In assessing at first hand the contribution made by the Irish Dairy Industry Association, one concludes that the current policy of seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will result in a net reduction in the number of cows, thereby reducing production, which will have a significant impact on the agriculture sector.  Is it fair to assume that there are inherent flaws in the scientific analysis of greenhouse gas emissions with regard to agriculture?  Mr. Gilhawley mentioned that eight model herds were used.  Is that in an Irish context or a European context?  The view coming across strongly here is that there is a long-term political imperative to reduce greenhouse emissions and, if I understand correctly, the measurements used for agriculture are inherently flawed, which means the final figures are flawed.  Thus, agriculture is not as large a transgressor in terms of greenhouse gas emissions as we would believe.  I am trying to get a rational understanding of the logic here.  If the political imperative in this country — which comes from the Green Party, to make no bones about it — is to reduce emissions, is it the case that the assumptions on which this is based are wrong?</p>, <p eid="para_60">Is it the view of the representatives that based on the current scientific analysis, changing the inputs — in terms of feedstuffs and so on — could have a positive impact in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the production of methane?  I always take the view that agriculture is not the big transgressor here and that it is easy for the political discourse to target it.  There are so many other mechanisms that can be used.  We need only look at the amount of waste and packaging produced but that has not been targeted in a similar way, politically, to agriculture.  That is something this Government needs to consider.</p>, <p eid="para_61">With regard to milk prices, what is the actual equilibrium rate or economic rate of return for milk production, in terms of the market as we see it now and in five to ten years' time after — in a worst case scenario — a 10% reduction?  The view of the representatives is that if production moves from Ireland to countries where there is less regulation, that will have effects in its own right.  The question is, politically, how do we stop that flow?  I am not sure whether the political will is currently there within the WTO to do this.  Does Commissioner Fischer Boel have the political will to do it?  My analysis is that she does not because she is trying to push through a number of what she would term to be reforms — CAP reform and the CAP health check — which will see pillar 1 to pillar 2-type spending.  That will have a serious impact on agricultural production here in the long run.</p>, <p eid="para_62">I am trying to get a greater understanding of how we in this committee can lobby our Government and what the Government needs to do at the Council of Ministers and at WTO level to stem the reduction.  Is there an alternative analysis to that being put forward by what I would term the establishment in terms of the reduction in cattle production, which we can get our teeth into and give a differing view?  I take the view simply that agriculture is the one sector that has remained constant despite the fluctuations in the wider economy. We should not throw out milk and meat production for the sake of attaining the goal of decreased global greenhouse gas emissions if we will find in the long run that our analysis was wrong.  That is the point I am trying to make in a very convoluted way.  I ask the Chairman to forgive me.</p>, <p eid="para_63">An alternative analysis needs to be put forward.  There is nothing within the presentation that I would disagree with but the politics of this will become very important.  It all depends on how much power is wielded in Government by the Green wing and whether this wing will seek to use it as a political stick to gain concessions.  That is not something I expect the representatives to answer, but it is a view that needs to be put forward.</p>]
