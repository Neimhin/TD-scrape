SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T16:30:00+00:00	Last week The Irish Times published a report by Conor Lally which stated that Garda Commissioners would have the same power as Cabinet Ministers in appointing staff. The article also said that the successor to Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan was unlikely to be appointed before September. My question is simple. What is the progress to date regarding the arrangements for the selection of the new Garda Commissioner? What is the expected timeframe? What is the new Commissioner's salary to be? What are the arrangements in relation to the appointment of a team to assist the Commissioner and whether changes to legislation are required?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T16:40:00+00:00	I am gleaning from the Minister that this is an ongoing process, no final salary has been determined and as of today there is still do not have a definitive date for an advertisement for the post. In clear yes-no terms, I ask the Minister if that is the case. I also ask the Minister in relation to the recruitment of staff within that department because the newspaper article states that there is the possibility that the new Commissioner "could appoint their own team around them. These would likely be hired on a contract basis". Furthermore, promotions and appointments, as we know them within the Garda network, are such that, "Promotions and appointments have long been regarded as open to favouritism and nepotism", and that some work had been done on that. Can the Minister give us guarantees that if somebody is appointed externally and at the discretion of the new Garda Commissioner, it will not cause upset within the force where one is now subject to certain rigors and a new process in relation to guarding against nepotism?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T16:40:00+00:00	If the process is such that the new Commissioner can appoint external persons at his or her discretion, will that require changes in legislation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T17:20:00+00:00	The Policing Authority report is very good. It is easily readable and digestible. There is the creation of a new language, as it were, within the Policing Authority regarding how it sets out the challenges it faces. Has there been any progress on the completion of the workforce plan and human resources strategy?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T17:20:00+00:00	Does the Minister acknowledge that concerns were raised in the report of 22 December 2017 about the pace of implementation? The July report stated that although the Garda Síochána had indicated that 20% were completed, the authority found on further investigation that many of those which had been marked as complete had, in fact, not met the intent of the relevant recommendation in Changing Policing in Ireland. Does the Minister acknowledge that the clear, cohesive language of the Policing Authority, which is reporting back to us and publicly, is telling us that there is still much change management to be completed within An Garda Síochána and that the pace of the implementation of change is not where it needs to be?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T17:30:00+00:00	I thank the Minister for his response. All Members, along with the community who are observing the ongoing change management, want to see a policing strategy and a committee to examine performance in that regard. I acknowledge that is taking place on a monthly basis but we must ensure that milestones are being reached and that reform, which is a slow and meticulous process, is achieved. Does the Minister agree that the role of the Policing Authority has been crucial in ensuring the progress of the change management process?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T20:40:00+00:00	I would like to ask, through the Leas-Ceann Comhairle, what the status of the motion will be if the Government is defeated on its amendment. If Fianna Fáil wins the day on this motion, is the Government obliged to carry out Fianna Fail's ask, so to speak, and de facto conduct a review? I ask the Minister that if, in the event the Government is defeated, it is obliged to carry out the review being called for in the motion? It is a technical question but there is a little political edge to it also. Tonight all Members received from the Minister, and I do not know if it was by accident or design, correspondence relating to the current situation that pertains to what some have called a fiasco. The correspondence is between Mr. Moat and the Minister, Deputy Naughten. I will quote from a letter dated 30 January addressed to the Minister in which Mr. Moat states: eir entered the [national broadband process] NBP in good faith with the ambition of winning the entire tender. We have spent over €7m during the past 30 months and have fully engaged in the process. Notwithstanding our well-communicated 'red line' issues, eir remained in the process and submitted our ISDS in September in the hope that these issues would be addressed in the final months of the contract negotiation."Red line" is the key phrase there. In his response dated 31 January, the Minister stated:When we met last Tuesday (23rd January 2018) my officials set out clearly that the completion of the draft contract negotiation phase of the project would not occur for several weeks yet. There was ample opportunity to continue to engage on outstanding "red line" issues, and it would, therefore, appear premature for eir to take a decision to exit the process. You indicated an Intent to consult further with your Board.We know what happened subsequently. What is perplexing everyone in and out of the political realm is the question of how this transpired. How did it transpire that there were still red line issues at this stage of the process such that Eir, as one of the bidders, decided to pull out of the market? What were those red line issues? Everyone here and outside these walls wants to know. If we had some articulation from the Minister or his officials as to what the red line issues were without invoking the cloak of commercial sensitivity, it would be very helpful for us to further understand the ongoing process. What is very confusing for me and thousands of others is that not too terribly long ago a deal, as I understand it, was done to facilitate Eir to provide for an extra 300,000 houses and premises. In the intervening period, approximately 100,000 of those have been covered. The Minister will clarify that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-06T20:50:00+00:00	Arguably, that is progress. How was that deal done and why did eir do that deal but a few short months later, completely and utterly pull the plug? We all have our theories on what is happening but it is incumbent on the Minister, perhaps not during Private Members' time tonight, but certainly tomorrow when we have statements, to clarify the correspondence he has sent to every Member on his interaction with Eir. There are serious questions in that regard. We all have scenarios in our constituencies of relevance to this issue. There is one pocket or enclave of 12 houses in my constituency, for example, where Eir came within 12 poles on either side before stopping the roll out. That is typical of west Cork and parts of Kilkenny. If one were to move around the Chamber, Members from every county would have an articulation of the very scenario I have just painted. The question now is whether the last bidder, in effect the winner given the scenario we are in, can come in and plug that gap. There is some scepticism out there, including on my part, given that it is reasonable to wonder what price it will take for the last bidder standing to come in and close the loop in those black spots if Eir could not do so within the current competitive architecture. Will that bidder in fact be able to name its price and hold the Government to ransom as a result? I am conscious of the time and those are just some of the issues we have. We will support the motion, but we do so under advisement in circumstances where there is a further opportunity for the Minister to come to the House tomorrow for statements. It is an opportunity for him, without using any couching language, to clarify matters for everybody here and outside who is depending on the national broadband plan, as well as on him for answers, and to set out his stall. He has come out fighting tonight, for which I give him credit, but he has stood over the facilitation of a crucial market share for a monopolistic player. The Minister will answer the point tomorrow night and I will give him time to think about it. There are still question marks over why it was done. I appreciate that a commitment was given to bring in 300,000 players, but where stands SIRO now? What is the nature of the communications with SIRO and does it exist as an entity? What are those other players doing within the market? Are they creating parallel processes or networks on which they can deliver products? There are a lot of questions but time, unfortunately, is against me. I look forward to having this debate with the Minister again tomorrow evening.
