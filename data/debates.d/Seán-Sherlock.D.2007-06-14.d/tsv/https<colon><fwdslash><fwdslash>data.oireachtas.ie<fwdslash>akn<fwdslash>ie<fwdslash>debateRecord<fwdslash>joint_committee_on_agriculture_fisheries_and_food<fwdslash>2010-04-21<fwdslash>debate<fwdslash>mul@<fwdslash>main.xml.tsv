SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I join in welcoming the Ombudsman before the joint committee.  I will not address the aspects of her presentation pertaining to the constitutional aspects of her office as that matter should be left for another day.  I believe that today's meeting of the committee should deal specifically with the Byrne case and the complaint made by the Byrne family.  I wish to get a sense of where the Byrne family were coming from in the first instance.  I wish to establish whether their primary motivation in the first instance was compensation or the replacement of tonnage.  I ask this question because both the Minister, in his statement to the Dáil on 4 February, and Mr. Plunkett seek to convey the clear impression that somehow, the primary motivation is a compensatory package.  However, to my mind the Byrne's primary motivation was the replacement of tonnage.  I wish to get a sense of the particular provisions under which Mr. Byrne made the complaint in the first instance and I ask the Ombudsman to articulate what they were.  First was that the special circumstances of his family's case were not properly considered by the Department and that the lost at sea scheme had not been properly advertised.  The Ombudsman should speak a little more on that issue.  In addition, the Department wrote to a number of potential applicants at the time and it already had records of the lost at sea.  As for the records concerning the lost at sea, is the term "deep storage" the Ombudsman's own or is it a term that is used by departmental officials?  It suggests to me that the Byrne family felt there should have been some record of the loss of the Skifjord and therefore that they should have come within the criteria.  I wish to establish in layman’s terms the reason that was not the case.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Therefore, one aspect of Mr. Byrne's complaint was that essentially, the Department did not try hard enough to deal with the fact that this boat has sunk and therefore, the Ombudsmen considered such a response to be inadequate in the context of designing the scheme.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the compensatory issue, the Ombudsman's report states on page 82 that:Because the Scheme has long since expired and because of subsequent developments in relation to Ireland's sea-fishing capacity, it would be inappropriate to attempt to apply the terms of the Scheme by way of a remedy — even though this is precisely what the Byrne family is seeking.  Besides, I could not recommend that the Department apply the terms of this scheme to the Byrne family in circumstances where their application did not meet at least two of the qualifying conditions.Given this scheme has long since expired, I seek to establish, in layman's terms, the reason the Ombudsman did not allow for tonnage to be divvied out, the reason she took a decision to award compensation and the reason she used the decommissioning scheme as the criterion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister, in his speech to the Dáil stated that given that the scheme was intended to allow families to continue a family tradition of sea fishing, it was difficult to see how it could be sustained that the Byrne family was disadvantaged by the failure of its application some 20 years later.  After the sinking, he said, the family was seen, perhaps understandably, to have left the fishing industry for the subsequent 20 years.There is an issue of quota here.  We would support the fact that compensation was paid.  The Ombudsman will correct me if I am wrong, but even if she could have recommended that tonnage should be given to the family, this could not have been done, in any event, because of the expiration of the scheme, quite apart from the restrictions on tonnage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Ombudsman referred to an interview with Mr. Carroll, the former Secretary General, on page 51.  How specifically designed was the scheme?  It seems to me that it was not a wide ranging scheme, but was very much targeted towards certain individuals.  Mr. Carroll agreed that the officials "were negatively disposed towards a change in policy" as was envisaged, but the then Minister was particularly tenacious on the issue.  The Ombudsman in her speech, stated that the Minister instructed that the scheme should go ahead but "no doubt, in view of the opposition of his officials and some of the producer organisations....I want to see how we can ringfence six to eight genuine cases including those before the High Court".On page 101 of the report, Deputy Fahey in his response to some of the deliberations stated that his use of the word "ringfence" should be interpreted as his wish to ring fence the scope of any scheme to only genuine bona fide cases.  Further use of the word "ringfence", he said, was in response to a note from a person.  The impression here is that really and truly natural justice was not served.  If it was really designed to have a broad scope, then the Byrne family would have quite easily fitted in under the criteria, which as they existed or were administered, had been designed with certain individuals potentially in mind.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	For the purposes of understanding can I clarify the difference between maladministration and contrary to fair and sound administration?  I am not being facetious in asking that question, but on page 18 of the report the Ombudsman refers to "maladministration" while on page 81, in terms of the recommendations, it is stated that the scheme was operated contrary to fair and sound administration.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, the Labour Party did not seek to politicise this issue.  We sought at all times to ensure the Ombudsman would be afforded an opportunity to appear before this committee in a non-partisan way.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have a concluding remark.  The Ombudsman, through this report, has endeavoured to seek natural justice.  Deputy McGinley has summed up the arguments in terms of the human factors.  Nobody in this committee would disagree with him that the rules of equity and fairness, as this scheme was devised, did not apply to the Byrne family.  I hope that natural justice is restored to this scheme and the Byrne family.  I also hope that the Oireachtas, in examining the powers of the Ombudsman, would proceed with caution.  If it is the case that there should be a reversal of the decision and a recommendation is made which seeks to compensate the Byrne family, which I hope will be the case, then we want to ensure that no changes are made in haste which will have us at this juncture again, except in a different set of circumstances.  I call for caution.  My experience of the Ombudsman's office is that it works well because the assumption under which we operate when we take a case to the Ombudsman is that fairness will prevail and the decision is recognised as a completely independent decision that all parties can accept.  If there is a change of heart in this case, we should proceed with caution thereafter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is the point that I was making.
