[<p eid="para_230">I apologise for coming late to the meeting.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me in and forgive me if some of my points have already been covered.  In regard to the constituency I represent, Cork East, there is a deep sense that there is not a policy in respect of the delivery of home care packages.  I know of nobody who is in receipt of a specific home care package, particularly in the north Cork area.  The sense I have of the situation as it relates to north Cork is such that the policy is <i>ad hoc</i> and that it is a little arbitrary in that there is no consistency for each individual.  One relies on the service but one cannot be guaranteed that it will be delivered to a particular person in his or her home at a given time and it can be cut at a given time also.  We want a national policy or guideline that ensures each person has a minimum right.  I realise Mr. Mulvihill may have addressed that point already and if he has, I apologise but I want to record it anyway.</p>]
