[<p eid="para_35">I welcome the Minister of State.  I must compliment him for succeeding in putting this issue on the political agenda, which I welcome, because it gives recognition to it as a sector of our economy with great potential to add value to local communities.</p>, <p eid="para_36">There are a number of farmers' markets in my constituency, including the one in Midleton, to which I am a regular visitor.  As they are by their nature organic in their organisation, with local people coming together to sell their produce, I would not favour any mechanism that would overregulate farmers' markets.  Much can be done to provide resources, including water and electricity supply if needs be.  However, they should not be overregulated regarding, for example, apples needing to be measured or have the dirt cleaned off them.  The duck eggs I buy from Castlelyons market on a Saturday morning should not need to be regulated to a degree.  Farmers' markets need to be retained as an organic organisation.  We cannot apply the same strictures that apply to, for instance, a restaurant, caf√© or other food outlet to a farmer's market.  We are going in the right direction because there is a political recognition of their importance.  They add value to the local economy and I welcome the contribution of the Minister of State in that respect.</p>]

[<p eid="para_188">There is an ambivalence in the Government's position on this issue.  The position the Government has taken at Council of Ministers level is one in which, one senses from the position of abstention, there has been a shift.  In spite of the scientific advice and rationale applied by the EU scientific committee, the Government is going against this advice and has adopted a position against the importation of EU scientific committee-approved feedstuffs.  If that is the Government's position or if the Government has arrived at a new position, there must be no ambivalence about it.  It must be clearly communicated to the agricultural sector because farmers who are feeding livestock will need to know the Government's position on this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_189">I am not a scientist, I am a layman, but my view is that we must rely on science.  The EU scientific committee has applied a certain rationale which is based on common sense and practical solutions.  If it is advocating a certain position, I do not understand why the Government is not adhering to that advice or why it would abstain on votes when the time comes.</p>, <p eid="para_190">What we are talking about is whether Irish agriculture can sustain its competitiveness and, ultimately, whether Irish consumers will have to pay for the increased costs of feedstuffs that arise from the non-importation of scientifically-approved feedstuffs from the EU.  If that is the case, it will have a negative permutation for consumers.  If these feedstuffs are not approved, the inevitable outcome is that we will begin importing cheaper produce that is fed on genetically modified organisms.  I do not see why we cannot apply a more rational approach.</p>, <p eid="para_191">The Minister of State said in his presentation:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_192">I have consistently said that the commitment in the programme for Government is not about banning imported feed but rather about seeking to negotiate the establishment of an all-Ireland GM-free zone so that we can avoid the release of live GMOs into the Irish environment.</p>, <p eid="para_193">The Minister says he is not against banning imported feed.  Will he tell us unequivocally whether he is opposed to the banning of genetically modified feed that is scientifically approved by the EU?  We require a clear statement of Government policy.  There must be no ambivalence at this stage in the process.</p>, <p eid="para_194">There is no dichotomy or contradiction between maintaining the biodiversity of this island and the importation of EU-approved feedstuffs.  The two are not mutually exclusive.  It is reasonable to express reservations about scientific trials on the growth of GM feedstuffs pending further debate and dialogue.  However, if the EU scientific committee advises and recommends that we import certain feedstuffs, I do not see why the Government cannot approve it.  We have all bought into that process by virtue of our membership of the EU.</p>, <p eid="para_195">The precautionary principle is rolled out when it is politically expedient to do so.  The Green wedge or wing of the Government has a politically philosophical position on these issues and there is a certain constituency to which it must play.  This is to the detriment of Irish agriculture and ultimately the Irish consumer who will end up, if we continue on this route, paying less but without a guarantee that imported livestock or meat products from third countries are GM-free.</p>]
