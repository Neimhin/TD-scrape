SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:40:00+00:00	I welcome Mr. Gloster and his colleagues to the committee. I congratulate him on his appointment as CEO. It is heartening to hear that he has some experience as a front-line professional in this space. That gives us some grounds for comfort. I am also encouraged by his attempt to ensure a transparent process in which we as public representatives are seen as key stakeholders in communications and the transparency of Tusla's functions. I wish to ask about the culture of the organisation. Mr. Gloster has spoken about ensuring a process of local ownership. I do not fully understand what that means. Is he talking about flattening the structure and getting rid of silos? What does that mean for social care workers, social workers, childcare workers or anybody under the employ of Tusla? We have to move beyond words and take actions. Every person working in the organisation must feel he or she has a pathway right to the top. There must be no Chinese walls. I would like Mr. Gloster's perspective on that. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	I welcome that. My second question is a programmatic one. The school completion programme, the guardian ad litem service and the creative community alternatives pilot programme are under way. They are three key programmes. I ask Mr. Gloster for his perspective on ensuring proper standards in the school completion programme and standardisation across the country. On the guardian ad litem legislation before the House, what is the full year cost of the guardian ad litem service? What transition planning is taking place to cede the service to the Department and what is Mr. Gloster's perspective of how the transition is proceeding? As a public representative I already see the outworking of the creative community alternatives programme, even though it is a pilot. It is having a positive impact on the ground. I am familiar with Cloyne Diocesan Youth Services, CDYS, in north Cork, an organisation that is probably typical of the many organisations that act as agents for this programme. CDYS is concerned that there will be staff lay-offs if its funding is not continued into 2020. Is it envisaged that the programme will continue? What tyre kicking, so to speak, has taken place in respect of that programme? From the conversations that I, as a Deputy in the area, am having with the people working on the programme, it is clearly having a positive impact on families. I am hopeful that we will see the continuation of the programme into 2020 and that Tusla will find a funding pot for it to ensure there will not be any lay-offs. I ask Mr. Gloster for his perspective on those questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	Is the â‚¬16 million adequate to meet the needs of the service as it is currently constituted?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	That is the key. It is a demand-led service, which is at the discretion of the District Court. If the judge makes a determination, Tusla has to resource it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	I appreciate the response. I spoke not only on behalf of CDYS but also in respect of the principle because-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	-----by Mr. Gloster's own admission, it is a very good programme. It could become a flagship programme for Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in future if resources can be allocated.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-11-06T10:50:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Gloster.
