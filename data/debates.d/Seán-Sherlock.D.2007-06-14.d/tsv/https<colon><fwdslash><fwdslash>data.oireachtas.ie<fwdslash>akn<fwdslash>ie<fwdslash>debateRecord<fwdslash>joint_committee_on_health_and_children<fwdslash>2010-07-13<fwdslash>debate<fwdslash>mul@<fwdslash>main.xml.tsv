SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I want to speak specifically on the reconfiguration process in so far as it relates to Mallow General Hospital.  I will be brief because I realise there are many questions to be answered today.  I raised this issue on the Adjournment last week and was given an undertaking by the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, that officials would be in touch with me to organise a meeting to discuss the acute services and the reconfiguration process as it pertains to Mallow General Hospital.I am concerned about the document that is being discussed internally.  It relates to ceilings of care, certain protocols and modelling systems that may be put in place by the HSE.  As a member of the Mallow General Hospital action committee and a representative of the people of Cork East, I believe this will have an adverse effect on the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services.Professor John Higgins states the reconfiguration process is about change management.  We are all in favour of the change that is necessary.  We were given undertakings that there would be no change to acute medical services and that they would be increased.  We were told there may be changes with regard to the delivery of accident and emergency services and acute surgical services.  The document I put into the public domain last week clearly contradicted that.  Trust has broken down.  We bought into a process with Professor Higgins whereby we accepted there would be ongoing negotiations with people such as the group I represent.  When the document came into my possession last week, it threw that process out the window.  Trust must be regained because it has been lost under Professor Higgins and the HSE with regard to the reconfiguration process.Some members may feel the advisory group comprises a wonderful approach that espouses lateral thinking.  However, when a secret advisory group is put in place and people who have bought into the reconfiguration process and who are trying to manage change, such as the people I represent, are not being consulted on that process or the internal document, it makes a mockery of the whole process.  I seek a meeting with the head of the HSE and the people who are in charge of reconfiguration at national and local levels.  That is all I want.
