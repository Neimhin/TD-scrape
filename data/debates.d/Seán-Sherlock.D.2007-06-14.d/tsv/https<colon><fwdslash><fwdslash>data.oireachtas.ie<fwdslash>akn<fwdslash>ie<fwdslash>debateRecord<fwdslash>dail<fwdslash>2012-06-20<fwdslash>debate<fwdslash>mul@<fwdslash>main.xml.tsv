[<p eid="para_304">The scheme will not be debated.  Best practice is to lay schemes before the Oireachtas and not to engage in debates on individual schemes.  I cannot accept amendment No. 2, the purpose of which is to have the scheme debated.  On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, clearly indicated he was unwilling to engage in a further full-blown, policy-based discussion on the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme when presenting it to the Oireachtas.  The time for policy-based discussions is during the presentation of Bills to the Oireachtas, not on the presentation of secondary legislation.  I understand Deputies were offered the opportunity to contact officials from the Department in the interests of discussing the draft scheme.  I am not sure whether, to date, any requests in this regard have been received.  To my knowledge, they have not but the matter is open to clarification.</p>, <p eid="para_305">The operator of the scheme is currently running workshops with the banks.  The target date for going live with the scheme is August.  As soon as the Bill is enacted, we will be in a position to try to ensure we meet this target.</p>, <p eid="para_306">Many of the arguments that have been put forward by Opposition spokespersons were also put forward in the previous debates on the Bill.  The Minister has been definitive in the context of replying to those arguments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_310">I do not know if Deputy O'Dea is playing politics with this issue-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_312">-----but I suspect he is doing so.</p>]
[<p eid="para_314">There is no precedent which would prevent the scheme, once it is up and running, being debated by the committee.  There is no lack of clarity on my part or that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in respect of that matter.  The Bill before the House is enabling legislation and the scheme is the subject of a procurement exercise.  There were actually two such exercises carried out in respect of the scheme, one for the design consultant and the other for the operator.  The Deputy is a former Cabinet Minister.  He would have had control over policy in the various Departments in which he served and he knows exactly how the game is played in respect of these issues.  He is also aware we are obliged to comply with the timelines relating to public procurement.</p>, <p eid="para_315">It took time to draft the legislation and deal with the various technical details involved.  However, this was necessary to ensure we got it right.  The process is all but complete and we want to ensure we will be in a position to roll out the scheme in August.  If the committee wants to discuss the scheme thereafter, there is absolutely no issue in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_316">That is a given.  It is a fundamental democratic principle that the committee be given that opportunity.</p>]
[<p eid="para_326">Without being disingenuous, I apologise to the Deputy if he found my remarks personally hurtful, although an element in my brain tells me his skin is thicker than he might let on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_328">The Deputy knows that when I say we know how the game is played, I mean there is a process and a system in place.  I was speaking in a metaphorical sense.  We are moving to ensure we can put the scheme in place and expedite it as quickly as possible.</p>, <p eid="para_329">The scheme must be targeted towards commercially viable businesses.  We are conscious that businesses have failed in the last while.  That is why we are anxious to get the scheme up and running before the fall of the year.  Business that are in trouble will not, necessarily, be supported by the scheme.  An application must be viable and accompanied by a business plan, with potential projections for the business.</p>, <p eid="para_330">The figure of 2% had to be charged, in line with state aid requirements.  In tabling amendments opposition Deputies must have regard to this.  State aid rules must be adhered to.  We must be cognisant of this in order that when we communicate our respective party positions on the Bill, the public will be made aware that the 2% charge is not being imposed simply for the sake of levying a charge.  There is an onus on us to do this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_332">It is important to answer the point.  A charge had to be made under State aid rules.  We all accept that premise.  That is fact.  The decision was for 0.8% upwards.  The Government chose 2% as the most appropriate rate because one must allow an appropriate figure to be able to cover losses contributed to by administrative and other costs.  One must factor that in.  We are dealing, essentially, with taxpayers' money and we must factor in a potential figure for those losses and 2% was deemed to be the most appropriate figure in that respect.</p>, <p eid="para_333">I have just been handed a note on the progress fund.  We do intend to approach the European Investment Fund, EIF, re support for the microfinance fund.  That will be introduced in the Houses in the coming weeks.  There will be progress in that regard.  Perhaps we can communicate with the Deputy on that particular issue as well.</p>]
[<p eid="para_341">I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already given a commitment that there would be a review of the scheme after a year of operation.  It would be right and proper that a review would take place.  As a matter of course one would have to review the scheme and I believe the Minister's commitment is sufficient.</p>, <p eid="para_342">One could argue that there may not be sufficient data, patterns or trends emerging on the type of lending that arises from the scheme before a 12 month period has elapsed.  That is the justification for the Government's decision in that respect.  However, the commitment has been definitively given by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in that respect.  The review will be broad and comprehensive and will not be restrictive as per the amendment suggested.  The policy commitment is to conduct a review and to lay it before both Houses.  The matter is adequately dealt with in section 10.</p>, <p eid="para_343">Invoice financing will be eligible for the scheme.  We will monitor closely the performance and we will consider if other types of credit should be included, as per Deputy O'Dea's point.  We will make changes if we deem it necessary following the review.  We are trying to ensure that we get the scheme off the ground, put a review mechanism in place after 12 months based on qualitative criteria and then if modifications or adjustments need to be made there is an open mind in government on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_345">I acknowledge the Deputy's point which has been made in good faith.  A scheme of this nature will be vital in providing the credit necessary to fund businesses which are the backbone of the economy.  In this light, it would be ridiculous not to review the scheme after a certain time.  It is important that it be reviewed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_346">Before continuing, I would be obliged if, in accordance with Standing Order 140, the Chair would direct the Clerk to make a verbal correction to the text of the Bill.  It relates to the ordering on page 4 of the Bill of the definitions of "participating lender" and "participating borrower".  I request that the order of these two definitions be changed in order that the definition of "participating borrower" is placed before the definition of "participating lender" in keeping with the alphabetical layout of the definitions on page 4.</p>]
