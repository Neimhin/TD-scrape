SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Mr. Nolan and Mr. Ryan for appearing before the committee today.  Their submission is hard-hitting and they do not pull any punches with regard to their views on Coillte.  This is an issue which the committee needs to consider seriously.  The submission states that the witnesses believe the forestry industry is unsustainable as a result of the reckless misadventures of Coillte.  If this is being said by the contractors' association who are at the coalface, so to speak, this needs to be investigated.  I support the views of Deputy Sheehan in that regard.  I would also argue that perhaps we need to discuss this with the new Minister.Just before Christmas, the Oireachtas passed a Bill which gave Coillte a re-financing facility of approximately €400 million.  In my view, this measure is very opaque, with more unknowns about this facility than there are knowns, so to speak.  The manner in which that procedure was rushed through the Dáil raised a number of questions, some of which are now coming forward in this submission.  There is a corporate governance issue with regard to Coillte.  There is no question but that its own standing staff quota has been reduced significantly over the years and no question but that Coillte took a punt on other avenues of business which have not borne fruit.  I realise it went into the construction industry at the height of the game and invested in ventures such as Medite and so on and these have not borne fruit.  However, if the forestry contractors are questioning issues with regard to machinery sales and the investment or diversification into nursing homes and if this is at a price of the quality of wood being grown and the management of the forestry, then we need to raise these issues with Coillte.I have a couple of questions on the submission.  I want to increase my understanding of the manner in which contractors are forced to take responsibility for the forest estate.  Can the witnesses elaborate on the ratio between standing sales and harvested sales?  As I understand it, Coillte seems to be shifting the goalposts.  If I am not mistaken, mills are having to compete with the contractors on management and on harvesting.  If that is the case, I wonder if we are setting a dangerous precedent.  I would like the delegates to elaborate on that.I would also like to ask about the percentage of land that is forested.  Does the Irish Forestry Contractors Association have any ideas on growing the number of trees needed to reach the 17% target?  I am also concerned about the issue of whether contractors and other stakeholders in the industry should be represented on the board of Coillte.  Would that help to address the whole issue of corporate governance?  If contractors are treated as major stakeholders, at least they will have some sort of say at the table when decisions are made about what is happening on the ground.I am most familiar with the Ballyhoura region.  I have seen at first hand the value of the amenities, including the bicycle trails, which have been developed there.  More and more, however, I am witnessing problems with Coillte's forestry management.  I look at forestry as a layman, as I do not have an expert view on it.  Every time I walk around the Ballyhoura Mountains, I can see the amount of dumping that is taking place.  I am sure this is replicated throughout the country.  When I was in the Ballyhoura region last Sunday, I thought the amount of dumping was absolutely scandalous.  I get a sense that the number of standing staff has been reduced to the extent that those who work to manage or monitor the forest resource are contractors, rather than permanent staff.  I suggest, from a layman's perspective, that the quality of wood may have diminished somewhat as well.  There was a time when between 25 and 30 men would have been working in an area like the Skahanagh and Castlepook region.  I realise that the mechanisation and modernisation of machinery has supplanted many of those men.  There was a time when those present on the ground were able to monitor what was going on.  It seems to me that Coillte has completely and utterly shifted its ethos towards a kind of outsourcing.  It is now trying to bring its outsourcing down to the lowest common denominator, by beginning to squeeze the contractors who are working at the coalface.I am glad we have received this submission today.  To a certain extent, it has opened our eyes to what is going on.  I would like the delegates to elaborate on the current pricing mechanisms for the contractors.  Where do they envisage that the future growth in their industry will take place?  Can we get some sort of elaboration on how they see that being addressed?  How can we assist that process?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Can the committee take it then that because the forest-scapes are currently so sparse, replanting is not occurring?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	There are certain things we can say under parliamentary privilege which Mr. Nolan cannot.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate his position.  The committee, however, can ask Coillte about an issue raised by Mr. Nolan concerning forestry machinery which he feels should be investigated.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Can I clarify this point?  Does Coillte have an obligation to clear this up?
