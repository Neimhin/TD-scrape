[<p eid="para_59">The spread of the Ebola virus in west Africa continues to present a significant challenge to the international community. We have an obligation to strengthen our collective response in order that the necessary skilled personnel and medical facilities are funded, mobilised and deployed to west Africa to deal with the crisis.</p>, <p eid="para_60"> I am aware of the comments to which the Deputy refers and I agree that all outstanding funding pledges must be met, quickly and in full. There is a moral obligation on donors to do so. It is only by tackling the Ebola virus in west Africa that we can ensure its spread will be arrested and lives saved. Ireland has been playing its part, however, through the work locally of our embassy in Sierra Leone and significant financial support for the Ebola response. The European Union and its member states have committed €1.1 billion to the Ebola response. Ireland will provide more than €17 million this year, directly and through non-governmental organisations, to the countries in west Africa most affected by the crisis. Some €10 million is being provided through our annual development programmes in our partner countries, Sierra Leone and Liberia. This support is focused particularly on strengthening their national health systems. We have also provided more than €4 million in recent months specifically for Ebola treatment facilities and work on contact tracing, community mobilisation and child nutrition programmes, among other activities.</p>, <p eid="para_61"> Ireland has a strong reputation for acting on its pledges and I confirm that all of our announced funding has been delivered. In recent days, the Minister and I announced an additional grant of €221,000 for the supply of essential food and non-food items to families in Sierra Leone affected by local quarantine restrictions. This funding will be disbursed without delay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_64">With regard to the EU response, there will be a further discussion at the December meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, at which the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be present, on that very issue of providing an update on funding and how it is being disbursed from an EU perspective. The EU Ebola co-ordinator will present further recommendations at that time.</p>, <p eid="para_65"> I wish to reassure the Deputy that, aside from the investment we are making in regard to assisting the health systems, the Irish response is part of the process. There is also the danger of the secondary humanitarian crisis that follows an outbreak of this nature, where there is already a weak health system. I visited Sierra Leone between 1 and 4 October and I am delighted to say we have a very strong embassy team in Freetown, headed by ambassador Sinead Walsh.</p>]
[<p eid="para_68">To pick up on the point about the Irish response, which is where we need to focus, the UN now has a mission on the ground which is co-ordinating the effort in the three most affected countries. The effectiveness of that response is as a result of an Irish influence on the ground because we are one of the few countries in the world that has a bilateral relationship with Sierra Leone - in other words, we have an embassy there. I would acknowledge the role of Irish workers, including our embassy staff, working on the ground with our agencies, such as GOAL and Concern. There are Irish workers on the ground who are having a major impact. We acknowledge the role of the Cubans and every other nation state for the workers they have sent but Irish workers are not only influencing at Government level, they are also influencing at United Nations level and they are an integral part of the response. Slowly but surely that impact is being felt in that we are getting ahead of it. It is important to note that the Irish taxpayers' moneys being disbursed are staving off a humanitarian crisis but also buttressing existing health systems on the ground.</p>]
[<p eid="para_113">Nigeria will hold presidential and National Assembly elections on 14 February 2015. These will be followed on 28 February by gubernatorial and state assembly elections. We are following developments in Nigeria closely through our embassy in Abuja. I understand that political associations in Nigeria are constitutionally prohibited from functioning as political parties unless they are registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. There are strict criteria for registration laid down in a guidelines document issued by the chairman of the commission in March last year.</p>, <p eid="para_114"> I am aware of the decision of the electoral commission to reject an application from the Socialist Party of Nigeria for registration as a political party. This matter is now the subject of proceedings in the Nigerian Federal High Court in Abuja. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specific case. However, as a general point of principle, I have no hesitation in calling for the forthcoming elections in Nigeria to be as inclusive as possible. It is important that they are conducted peacefully, transparently and credibly. The challenge, but also the importance of this, is underlined by the deteriorating security situation in the north east of the country and the violence being perpetrated by the terrorist group, Boko Haram.</p>, <p eid="para_115"> I welcome that in September the EU committed €15 million to support Nigeria in preparing for these elections, which involve in excess of 70 million registered voters and 150,000 polling stations. I also welcome the decision of the EU to deploy an electoral monitoring mission to monitor the elections. We have nominated a number of Irish observers for appointment to the mission.</p>]
[<p eid="para_117">I understand that the case is currently before the courts and is listed for a second hearing tomorrow, 27 November.</p>]
[<p eid="para_119">From an Irish perspective Nigeria has been identified as an emerging high potential growth market in the context of the review of the Government trade, tourism and investment strategy 2010-2015. It is regarded by Enterprise Ireland as the second most important sub-Saharan African market after South Africa. Nigeria is Ireland's largest goods trading partner and largest export market in sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, total merchandise trade was worth more than €500 million and significant amounts of Ireland's exports to Nigeria come from Irish indigenous companies. Ireland's first trade mission to Nigeria took place last year and focused on financial services and education, again supporting Irish jobs and Irish workers. Some 70 Enterprise Ireland client companies are currently engaged in business with Nigeria.</p>]
