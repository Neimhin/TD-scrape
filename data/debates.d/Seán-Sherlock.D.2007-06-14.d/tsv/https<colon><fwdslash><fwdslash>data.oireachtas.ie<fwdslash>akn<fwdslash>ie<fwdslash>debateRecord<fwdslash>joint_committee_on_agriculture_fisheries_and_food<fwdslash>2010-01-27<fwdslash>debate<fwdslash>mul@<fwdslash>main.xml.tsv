SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Chairman.  I too welcome Mr. Ryan, Mr. Maguire and Ms McCann to the committee.  I have some very short and glaringly obvious questions to which I would like immediate answers.  Did the Irish Draught Horse Breeders Association apply to take ownership or control of the studbook?  Does the Department recognise that the Irish Draught Horse Society has made an application for the studbook?  That seems like an obvious question but I just want an answer for the record.  Does the Department recognise that the Irish Draught Horse Society has a legal personality?  I would appreciate answers to those three questions before proceeding with my next round of questioning.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In effect, no application has been made at close of——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I want to be unequivocal about this.  Is it correct that no application was received by the IDHBA to take control of the stud book?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have to keep reminding myself about why we are here and what is the issue.  The society is seeking to take ownership and control of the stud book to preserve the breed in perpetuity.  I, therefore, have a question about passports.  When a passport is issued by Horse Sport Ireland for a draught horse with draught horse parentage on both sides, does it state that the horse is an Irish draught horse or an Irish sport horse?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	For a period, therefore, in the 1990s Irish draught was not recorded on passports of foals who were born with Irish draught parentage on both sides.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I would like to fast forward to the Department's correspondence of 16 October 2009 with Ms Anne Loughnane, which refers to the application to maintain the stud book for the Irish draught horse.  Mr. Michael Dillon in response to Ms Loughnane's application for approval under EC Equine Studbook and Competition Regulations SI 399/2004 to maintain a stud book for the Irish draught horse outlined the reasons for the intended refusal of the application.  He states:Horses of the breed to be entered or registered in the stud book for which approval is sought may be entered or registered in a section of a stud book which is maintained by a person or an international organisation or association already approved and operated in conformity with annex 95353...HSI is already approved to maintain the stud book...and can already be registered in the existing approved Irish draught horse stud book maintained by HSI...The Minister may refuse to grant an approval for the purposes of maintaining a stud book if he or she considers that the granting of approval would endanger the preservation of the breed or jeopardise the improvement or selection programme of one or more organisations or associations already approved.This is central to the debate.  If we accept that the IDHS has a legal personality and its modus operandi is the preservation of the breed, it is ludicrous for anybody, including a Minister or official, to suggest its application for control of the stud book would potentially be considered to endanger the breed.Why can nobody come up with a solution that suggests that if the IDHS takes control of the stud book, it will in no way impede the future of the sport horse while also ensuring the pedigree and future of the draught horse?  If the society is concerned about the breed, it is the most likely organisation to have the purity of the breed at heart.  It would cost the Exchequer nothing in the sense that the breed would be maintained but the future economic viability of other breeds would also be ensured as a result.  I cannot tally this.  This is an overtly political decision, which has no regard to the future of the breed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With due respect, it is given as a reason for the refusal to grant control over the stud book.  The letter quotes from the legislation and this is used as one of the reasons for refusal.  It states, "... he or she considers that the granting of approval would endanger the preservation of the breed or jeopardise the improvement or selection programme of one or more organisations ...".  Mr. Ryan stated that HSI has more competence to ensure the continuation of the breed but it is disingenuous to suggest that the reason for refusing to grant control over the stud book to the IDHS is there may be a potential danger to the breed therein.  That is how that could be interpreted by a layman such as myself.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How would that be detrimental?
