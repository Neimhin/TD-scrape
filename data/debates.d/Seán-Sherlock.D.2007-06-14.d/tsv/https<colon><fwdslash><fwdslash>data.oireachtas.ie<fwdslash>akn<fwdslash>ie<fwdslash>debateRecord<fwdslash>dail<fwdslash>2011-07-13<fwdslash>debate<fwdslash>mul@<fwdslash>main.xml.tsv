[<p eid="para_1670">The EU Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, (FP7) covers the period 2007-2013 and has a budget of approximately €50 billion.  The national target for drawdown by Ireland from FP7, over the seven-year period, is €600 million.  The tabular statement that is being provided with the official reply provides details of the amounts of funding awarded to Irish participants to date.</p>, <p eid="para_1671">The number and value of projects funded from FP7 which have a North-South dimension, are as follows:</p>, <p eid="para_1672">Some 43 projects, securing €35.2 million, have a North-South dimension.  These projects involve 119 Irish participants (47 from Northern Ireland and 72 from the State). The amount of funding awarded was €8,495,247 to Northern Ireland participants, and €26,699,845 to participants from the State.  The period covered, for which latest figures are available, is from 2007 to April 2011, inclusive.</p>, <p eid="para_1673">Details of the number and value of projects funded, in which the lead partner is from the State and includes a researcher from Northern Ireland, are as follows:</p>, <p eid="para_1674">16 projects securing €20.9 million, have the lead partner in the State and include a researcher from Northern Ireland. The breakdown of funding to these projects is €17.5 million to the participants from the State and €3.4 million to participants from Northern Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_1675">FP7 has long been identified as an area where cross-border collaboration is feasible and makes eminent sense.  In order to maximise Irish participation in FP7, Ireland's National Support Office, which is headed by Enterprise Ireland, leads an all-island approach by all of the relevant agencies to promote FP7 and support the participation of companies and research organisations to provide significant competitive advantage for the island of Ireland.  The aim is to focus on areas and instruments that present opportunities for cross-border collaborations, including opportunities to exploit existing and future sectoral networks.  One example of this approach was the recently held Regions of Knowledge Conference in Belfast, on 30th   June, 2011, which was attended by representatives of the research community from both sides of the border.</p>, <p eid="para_1676">Overall funding from FP7 to Irish participants per annum to date</p>, <p eid="para_1677">€m*</p>, <p eid="para_1678">2007</p>, <p eid="para_1679">49</p>, <p eid="para_1680">2008</p>, <p eid="para_1681">32</p>, <p eid="para_1682">2009</p>, <p eid="para_1683">72</p>, <p eid="para_1684">2010</p>, <p eid="para_1685">116</p>, <p eid="para_1686">2011</p>, <p eid="para_1687">26**</p>, <p eid="para_1688">Total</p>, <p eid="para_1689">295</p>, <p eid="para_1690">*Amount of funding notified by the Commission for allocation to Irish-based participants (not including Northern Ireland) in proposals approved for funding during the year in question</p>, <p eid="para_1691">**This figure to April 2011 only.</p>]
