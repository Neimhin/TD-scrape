SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T16:40:00+00:00	Children with Down's syndrome whose level of intellectual disability places them in the mild general learning disability, GLD, range may receive individual resource teaching hours in the same manner as children with other low-incidence disabilities but they receive their support through the general allocation model, GAM. Schools have provision, under the GAM, to allocate and target resources to those children most in need of those resources and also to make the best use of those resources. Although not prescriptive, children with mild GLD will generally receive approximately 2.5 teaching hours per week under the GAM allocation. This provision is reflective of the resource teaching support which is provided for children with mild GLD prior to the introduction of the GAM. Schools also have a discretion to supplement teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils with greatest need and where a child with Down's syndrome also had a diagnosis of moderate general learning disability and thus received an additional low incidence resource teaching allocation of 3.5 hours, the difference between that provided under the GAM, if the child was receiving 2.5 hours, would be one hour. However, the difference could be less if the school was supplementing teaching support under the GAM through shared and group teaching for pupils. Can I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to complete the questions?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T16:40:00+00:00	Historically, the Department allocates resources to support children with special needs on the basis of categories of disabilities but for many years children with special needs were primarily educated in special schools or special classes. These schools and classes were designated as catering for a specific category of disability, but the report of the Special Education Review Committee, SERC, of 1993 made a wide range of recommendations on the level of resources that should be allocated to cater for children in different categories of special needs. The SERC report still provides much of the basis which underpins the current policy and provision. The disability category set out in the SERC report formed the basis of resource allocations. That report did not identify Down's syndrome as a particular disability category for the allocation of resources and consideration of the categories of disability to be catered for under the GAM based on high incidence or less severe disability was centred mainly on the category of mild general learning disability detailed in the SERC report. I refer the Deputy then to my original reply.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T16:40:00+00:00	I acknowledge the points made by Deputy Finian McGrath. They will be taken on board.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T17:00:00+00:00	The Children's Rights Alliance report noted that the Department of Education and Skills received an overall "B-minus" grade for solid progress, particularly in literacy, patronage and school buildings. This is one of the highest grades given to any Department and reflects well on the overall performance of our education system. The report also notes that the level of investment in the area of special educational needs was maintained in the current school year but that implementation of the EPSEN Act has been delayed. I understand and acknowledge the concerns that have been expressed to date about the delay in implementing the EPSEN Act. In light of the very difficult economic situation, the previous Government deferred full implementation of it. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has advised that an additional investment of up to â‚¬235 million per annum across the education and health sectors would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. In the Department's view, the level of investment required could be greater. While the Minister has done his best to date to preserve overall funding for special education, it has not been possible to identify additional resources from within the education budget to cover this cost. The NCSE has been asked to provide policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special needs. This advice will guide the preparation of a plan on how aspects of EPSEN can be implemented, including prioritising access of children with special needs to an individual education plan.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T17:00:00+00:00	I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. As I stated earlier, the NCSE has been tasked with the provision of policy advice on the appropriate nature and configuration of educational supports required to be allocated in order to achieve as much as possible of EPSEN within the confines of the parcel of funding available in that regard. The Government will endeavour to ensure as much as possible of it is implemented. The internal assessment is that the cost could be higher than the figure which I mentioned earlier. We will do our best to implement EPSEN within current constraints.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T17:00:00+00:00	Without being facetious, that is too optimistic. A number of sections have already been implemented. I can provide a list of all the sections that have been implemented thus far but for the sake of brevity, I will not do so now. I take the point made by Deputy O'Brien in regard to ensuring greater collaboration between the Departments of Education and Skills and Health and for people to think outside the traditional silos within which they exist in terms of delivery of policy outcomes. I note the point made in that regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-03-07T17:10:00+00:00	Is the Deputy serious?
