SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-06T14:20:00+00:00	I find this disconcerting. Minister of State after Minister of State is rolling in here, giving us a five-minute statement, going through the motions and then walking out again. This is one of the greatest crises that we have faced nationally and globally in generations. More respect should be given to the issue at hand in the first instance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-06T14:30:00+00:00	There is an obligation in law for the Ministers to present cases or what they are doing as per their own Departments. There is no opportunity to interrogate that whatsoever.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-06T14:30:00+00:00	There are young people here today. The optics of this with regard to how this Parliament deals with this issue are atrocious. I wish to record that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-06T14:40:00+00:00	I express my disappointment that there are not senior Ministers present for this discussion on such a vital topic. Nobody would deny that the Minister is absolutely committed to addressing climate change. His integrity in respect of the issue is beyond question. His interaction with the Joint Committee on Climate Action was one of quality and there was a clear commitment on his part to seek to tackle climate change in a systematic way. Notwithstanding that, there are certain obligations under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act. That is why we are having these statements today. The Act prescribes that details on emissions, inventories and projections should be published. We did not hear from the Minister or Ministers of State clearly defined projections as to how they proposed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We are now at the stage where the annual transition statement is disconcerting in how it depicts a lot of positive action, without stating clearly how far this country is off course in tackling climate change. We are moving in the wrong direction in climate pollution. Emissions are rising, rather than falling, contrary to all targets, legal obligations and political commitments. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Ireland agreed to cut emissions by 5% per annum from 2018 until 2050.Ireland is one of just two EU member states that will not meet these commitments. There is without question a need for radical action. We have to see a greater sense of urgency from the Government in dealing with the challenges we face. It must involve a clear policy on carbon budgets. Secretaries General have come before the Joint Committee on Climate Action. It has to be said that, in the case of most Departments, there is no sense of urgency about a set of mitigation policies that would contribute to the cutting of emissions. It was made clear in the recent special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that we had a narrow window of opportunity to enable global warming to stabilise gradually at 1.5Â° Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures. It has been well articulated that this will require unprecedented changes within the next 12 years. We have to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 45% from 2010 levels by 2030. We have to transition to net zero emissions globally by around 2050. According to the Minister, the EPA is in the process of updating its projections for greenhouse gas emissions to reflect the impact of a higher level of policy ambition. For example, the climate action commitments contained in the national development plan are being factored in. I think we need to see that happen sooner rather than later. We need to ensure that when this Parliament reports on the findings of the Citizens' Assembly, the policy outcomes that will result from the assembly's recommendations are more radical than, or at least equal to, those recommendations. We need to see more radical action at community level in respect of the potential to use wind energy and for the deep retrofitting of houses. Communities need to be helped to own and buy into energy projects. As we have articulated at the joint committee, there are numerous possibilities to do things across the agriculture and environment sectors, as well as others. They can be measured. Programmes should be under way within the next three months. If we do not start to act on a quarterly basis, with proper metrics and proper targeting, we will be using the same language again this time next year. As the economy grows, there will be challenges. For example, the effect of increases in greenhouse gas emissions will need to be offset. The only way to do it is by ensuring the funds readily available to the Government are used in a way that will facilitate people on the ground who want to take radical action. It is clear from the report of the Citizens' Assembly that people are of a mind to take radical action. We need to put in place policies that will be backed up by proper funding and that allow people to start to take action at all levels, down to community level. That means transitioning away from diesel and petrol vehicles towards electric vehicles and providing for the deep retrofitting of older housing stock, to mention just two examples of something that could be done in a very short space of time with some energy and commitment. If we are all here this time next year, when the country is meeting its obligations under the annual transition statement, we will need to give greater political urgency to this matter. By this time next year, we must ensure we will have reached a set of targets collectively and in a non-partisan way that will enable us to say we are seeing clear evidence of a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not achieve these targets, we will be on a hiding to nothing.
