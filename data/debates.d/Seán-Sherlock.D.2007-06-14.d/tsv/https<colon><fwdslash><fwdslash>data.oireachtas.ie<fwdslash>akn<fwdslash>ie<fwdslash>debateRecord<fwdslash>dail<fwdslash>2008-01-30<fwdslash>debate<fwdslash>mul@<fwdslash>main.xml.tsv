SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to debate a matter of national importance, namely, the proposal to construct a northern relief road at Mallow, County Cork, and the urgent question why the notices to treat were not served to landowners within the vicinity of the project and why the NRA has postponed this project again.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Today I received three pieces of correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle's office regarding four questions I put down to Ministers, three of which, relating to the upkeep of the N72 and N73 roads in County Cork, were disallowed on the basis that the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for this matter, which falls within the remit of the National Roads Authority.  I also posed a question to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources about Lombardstown Post Office and the continuance of its operation and, again, I was told that the Minister has no official responsibility.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When is it deemed possible for a Member of this House to ask a question he or she feels is pertinent to the running of his or her constituency and is important enough to raise on the floor of the House by way of a parliamentary question, without being told it is an operational matter not for the Minister but for the NRA?  Is it now the case that the Minister for Transport no longer has responsibility for roads and that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources no longer has responsibility for An Post?
