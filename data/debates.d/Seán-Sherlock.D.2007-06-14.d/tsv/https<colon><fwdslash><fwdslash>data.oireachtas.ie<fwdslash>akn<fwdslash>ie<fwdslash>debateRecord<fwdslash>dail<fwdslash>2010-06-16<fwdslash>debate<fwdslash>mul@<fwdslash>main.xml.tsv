SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We have shifted the blame on to the managers now.  That is a subtle shift in position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Why not have a public inquiry?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Government will not be able to do anything after spending €22 billion on Anglo Irish Bank.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How many cases have been tried under that legislation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is only rubbish; ráiméis in ainm Dé.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Fianna Fáil wined and dined them or else it was the other way around.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Based on Department of Finance figures.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will start by nailing the lie that is coming from the Fianna Fáil benches in regard to the Labour Party and any policies it may or may not have.  I invite Deputies McGrath, Collins and Byrne to take a look at the Labour Party website.  Therein they will see at least 50 position and policy papers on a wide range of subjects from tourism right through the economy.  I invite them, in particular, to take a look at the Labour Party proposals on the creation of a strategic investment bank that will get this economy up and running again.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It will create wealth and jobs and will be used in a manner which is productive and will grow the economy, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and can be used effectivity to get this economy up and running again.  I want to nail this lie which is now emerging from Fianna Fáil that somehow we are a party which is devoid of policies.  It is an insult to the intelligence of anybody in the Labour Party who put their names to a ballot paper because it suggests somehow that we were devoid of any kind of substance politically before we ever decided to enter politicsWe have always been a policy-driven party.  I invite people to take a look at our record in terms of our involvement in this House down through the years and ages.  The record will speak for itself on that matter.  When we are in Government the people of this country will see that we will do our best for them and will not be pandering to vested interests.On the reports, nobody, including me who is on my first mandate, had perfect knowledge on the fateful night of September on the Government's position or the true picture of where the banks stood.  It is right and proper that when we are legislating in this House that every single Deputy who is given a mandate in this House has perfect knowledge.  It is very clear now — we do not seek to take political advantage from it — that the guarantee which was given on that night was too wide-ranging.  It was too big a blanket, in terms of how it covered the individual banks.Anybody who examines the reports in any objective fashion will see that it was too wide ranging.  Anybody who is an ordinary decent citizen of this land will see that the cost of covering Anglo Irish Bank has been €22 billion so far, if I am not mistaken.The €22 billion spent thus far is money that the next Government will be down in terms of being able to provide services to the ordinary decent citizens of this country.  Fianna Fáil Deputies will be lambasting us from the other side of the House for not delivering services because we will be down €22 billion.  This is Fianna Fáil's classic game.  It is acting as surreptitiously as possible and is spinning the story that winding down the bank in an orderly manner will cost a multiple of €22 billion, even though we do not know that for certain.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We want transparency so that every citizen, regardless of his or her political affiliation, can decide whether the Government of the day is doing a decent job.These independent reports clearly have not vindicated the Government's position.  Their criticism of past macro-economic policy and the over reliance on tax breaks is as clear as the nose on my face.  The bottom line is good governance in the banks, a proper regulatory framework and a public inquiry that allows us to understand the relationship between politics and banking so that we can develop legislation that ensures the chicanery we have become used to over the past decade will be no more.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would the Deputy have done two masses?
