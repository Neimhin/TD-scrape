SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This was a very important deal, worth €180 million.  I would like time to be made available to discuss the issue next week.  When will the Supplementary Estimate be made available?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On 12 November, I received a response to a parliamentary question regarding the publication of a report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children on complaints made against the Diocese of Cloyne.  It is now 11 December and I was told the report would be published before the end of the year.  Will time be made available to the House to discuss this issue?  It is a vital report.  I sought to raise it by way of a parliamentary question, but I do not see any point in raising it under Standing Order 32.
