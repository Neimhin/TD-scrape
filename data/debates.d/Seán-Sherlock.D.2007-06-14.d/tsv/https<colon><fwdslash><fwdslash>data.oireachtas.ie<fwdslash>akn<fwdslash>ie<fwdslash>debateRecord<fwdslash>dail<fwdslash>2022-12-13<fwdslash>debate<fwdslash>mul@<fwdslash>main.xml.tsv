I want to extend to Mrs. Aylward and her family, on behalf of the Labour Party, our deepest sympathy on the passing of Bobby. I was first elected to the Dáil in 2007 and I served on the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with Bobby. Like every Member of this House, I found him to be a warm-hearted and decent person who was collegiate. He was partisan in the sense that he was staunch Fianna Fáil but he was the type of person you could work with and he was decent, affable and amiable. We all miss him and it is hard not to sense his spirit here. We are deeply sorry for the Aylward family's loss. He will be remembered and he is remembered beyond the enclave of south Kilkenny. There are others here from across the land who remember him fondly as a decent person. I extend our deepest sympathies to the Aylward family.
