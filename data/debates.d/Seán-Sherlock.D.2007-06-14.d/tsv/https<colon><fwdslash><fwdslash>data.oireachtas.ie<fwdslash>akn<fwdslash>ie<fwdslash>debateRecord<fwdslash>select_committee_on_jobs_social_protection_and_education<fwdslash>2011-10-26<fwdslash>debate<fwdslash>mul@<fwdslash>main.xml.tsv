SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Se√°n Sherlock)	None	I thank the Deputy for his proposed amendment.  The amendment refers to section 5(3) and the motion is for the deletion of lines 6 to 10 and the insertion of "no later than three months after the passing of this Bill into law".  The text of section 5(3) is standard and allows for the Act to come into operation on a date or dates to be specified in an order or orders.  This gives ministerial discretion on when the Act would become effective in law.The purpose of the subsection is to allow for any administrative changes required before the Act can be commenced.  In this instance it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them into line with the London agreement.  The proposed amendments to the Patents Rules 1992 are being drafted at present.  I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to commence the Act and the new Patents (Amendment) Rules 2011 by way of an order or orders as near to the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Act 2011 as possible.  I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment on this basis.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I assure the Deputy there is a sense of urgency about this matter.  However, I cannot give him a definitive timeframe today.  Dialogue with the Office of the Attorney General is ongoing.  We are in a queue, if one will, in terms of our deliberations with the Attorney General.  We are pressing her office as much as possible to try to have the legislation expedited in as timely a fashion as possible.  While I am not in a position to give a definitive timeframe, I am cognisant of the need to ensure we get all the pieces together and expedite the legislation as quickly as possible.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 4, subsection (3), line 7, to delete "Enterprise, Trade and Innovation" and substitute "Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	If the Deputy wishes to check the record, the initiation process for this legislation was started some time ago under the previous Government.   I am not trying to fudge the question in any way but I can only speak about my time as a Minister of State.  We are discussing Committee Stage of the Bill in a new Parliament that was given a mandate this year.  I contend that we are proactively engaging with the matter in hand.  In terms of the historical perspective, there was a process of engagement and the legislation was initiated.  As to the reason the Bill did not come to Committee, Report and Final Stages earlier, one could argue - again I am not trying to fudge the question - that is a matter for previous Administrations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The message we are sending today is that the unitary patent is a matter of European Union policy, as agreed by all of the member states.  The concept of the EU patent, which was previously known as the "Community patent" is to provide a patent system that is affordable and devoid of administrative barriers across the member states.  We all buy into that process because it will benefit all stakeholders.  Any Irish businesses seeking to bring goods to market or exploit the potential of their intellectual property and so forth will be able to do so in a streamlined and consolidated process.  We are evolving towards that position.  What the Bill does is legislate for the London agreement to which Ireland signed up.  It is another staging post.  The Government is actively grappling with this matter and, as I indicated to Deputy O'Dea, issues have arisen in respect of further engagement with the Attorney General.  The matter is ongoing and we are taking a proactive approach to it as we are conscious of the need to expedite the legislation.
