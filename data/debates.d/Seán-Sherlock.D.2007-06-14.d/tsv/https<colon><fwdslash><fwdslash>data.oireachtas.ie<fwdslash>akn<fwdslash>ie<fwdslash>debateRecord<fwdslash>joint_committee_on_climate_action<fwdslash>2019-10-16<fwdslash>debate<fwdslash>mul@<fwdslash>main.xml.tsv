SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:00:00+01:00	I will do some rapid fire questioning, if the Chairman does not mind. Professor FitzGerald is looking hale and hearty before his impending birthday. I congratulate him as he has been a great figure on the public landscape and he has always spoken with a great degree of common sense. It is very easy to listen to what he has to say as it is always based on common sense. I want to speak to the binary argument of beef versus forestry. Given the years of experience, what is the perspective of Professor FitzGerald? That is either wearing the Climate Change Advisory Council hat or the professor hat.Can horticulture drive a wedge into that binary argument and force us to think more laterally about what food we are producing and land use? Can we get a short perspective on that from Professor FitzGerald to begin with?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	Does the Climate Change Advisory Council have a mandate to look at that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	That is at a micro level.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	My second question relates to Professor FitzGerald's earlier intervention when he spoke about the need to legislate for the carbon price or tax trajectory. What would such legislation look like? If the Climate Change Advisory Council were to legislate for this tomorrow morning, what would it advise the Government to do? What would that legislation look like? Would it be highly prescriptive on the trajectory? Would it set out a certain price for every year leading up to a given target?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	My next question relates to the financing of climate action. It is difficult for us as Members to draw a line under what is currently allocated for climate action. The whole philosophy is based on behavioural change. The people I represent are not in a position to switch from a diesel engine to a fully electric engine. They are not in a position to spend between €50,000 and €80,000 retrofitting a 1970s bungalow. If we are talking about financing, incentives have to be provided. Local authority housing has extraordinary potential to take carbon out of the atmosphere. What would a scheme look like? Has the Climate Change Advisory Council given consideration to the cost of such a scheme? Has it looked at the entirety of the local authority housing stock in the country? We are starting with a project in the midlands, for which €20 million has been provided. We all absolutely welcome that, but I represent the people of Cork East. There are many people in Cork East living in local authority houses who do not believe they are eligible for such schemes. It is a question of how we incentivise private homeowners and those in local authority houses. I put it to Professor FitzGerald that if we do not have an entire figure for what has been allocated to retrofit houses, it is difficult to do an assessment of what we could allocate per house. Does the advisory council have a perspective on how we would finance that? I suggest that it must be part grant and possibly part savings. It is conceivable that when people reach a certain age, for example, when their children have flown the nest, there may be a few bob in the credit union. Maybe we could combine a grant, part savings and part loan. Has the advisory council given some thought to this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	So did I.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-16T15:10:00+01:00	That is a big range.
