Apologies have been received from Deputies Eugene Murphy and Dara Murphy and from Senators Colette Kelleher and Denis Landy. The usual proviso pertains regarding the use of mobile phones; I do not need to go through that again. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.
