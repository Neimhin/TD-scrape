SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:40:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister. On the figure of €6,000 per week, I would welcome a further breakdown. The Minister stated it is the average cost of each residential place and that it is across voluntary, statutory and private providers. It would be very useful if the Minister could provide to us a breakdown. How is the metric of €6,000 arrived at? What percentage of it is attributable to insurance? What proportion of the cost is attributable to the cost of renting private property? What is the real-time metric for staffing costs? I have some sympathy in that there are quite a number of children with very complex needs but the figure of €6,000, or €312,000 per annum, seems extremely high. It would be useful to have a breakdown or a further perspective from the Minister on the justification for those costs.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:40:00+00:00	One would always appreciate that. One always appreciates that there is a ratio of staff to children. That is a given and it is widely understood in every context where one is dealing with children. If in parsing a figure of €6,000, the Minister is saying it is across residential, voluntary, statutory and private providers, and if a certain number of private companies are offering the service, how much of the €6,000 is for profit in private facilities? The private providers are obviously offering the service because the State is not in a position to do so. How much do the private companies have the State over a barrel - I do not mean that in a pejorative way - because of the lack of supply of State-funded facilities for the provision of services to children with complex needs and children who need residential placements? I do not deny that we need to use private companies where there is a lack of supply in the public sector but I am worried that it is always possible to make a charge that private companies can profiteer in providing such a service. That is my worry. A figure of €6,000 per week, or €312,000 per annum, is an extraordinary amount of money. That is why I asked the question about the breakdown in the first instance. If we are involved in an Estimates programme here — it is one of the few powers we have as Deputies in terms of interrogating the Estimates, especially where a Supplementary Estimate is sought from the Houses of the Oireachtas — it is vital that we have a breakdown of the €6,000 and that we have more oversight in respect of how much the private providers are actually earning as private providers of what is essentially a vital service that nobody would deny to any child.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:40:00+00:00	That is accepted.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:50:00+00:00	We need transparency around this process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:50:00+00:00	I thank the Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:50:00+00:00	Might I say-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T13:50:00+00:00	But we are entitled to expect that the Minister would come before us with a breakdown of the €6,000 per week, and that her officials would have anticipated that we would have interrogated that figure of €6,000.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T14:00:00+00:00	What is the status of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill 2019, which pertains to guardians ad litem? It seems to have gone to ground. I am not being facetious but we were going great guns on Committee Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T14:00:00+00:00	We had robust exchanges, as we tend to have, which is good. It appears, however, to have just dropped off the face of a cliff.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T14:00:00+00:00	It has been longer. We came out of the recess and out of the starting blocks. It was published.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T14:00:00+00:00	Fair enough. What is the status of the Bill?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-03T14:00:00+00:00	I thank the Minister and I appreciate that.
