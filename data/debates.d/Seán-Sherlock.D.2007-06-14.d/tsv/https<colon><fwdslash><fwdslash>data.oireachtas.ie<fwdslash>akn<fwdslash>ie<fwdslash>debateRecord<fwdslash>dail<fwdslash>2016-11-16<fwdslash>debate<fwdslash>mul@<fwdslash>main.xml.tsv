[<p eid="para_573">I wish to raise the lack of access to women's gynaecology services in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH. Women in the Cork region have drastically longer waiting times for these services than women elsewhere in the country. It is causing devastating consequences for the women and their families in the region served by the Cork University Hospital and CUMH.</p>, <p eid="para_574"> I will outline some facts that have been communicated to me. I admit to being quite new to this issue. The matter was referred to me by a consultant gynaecologist and the director of the gynaecology unit at Cork University Maternity Hospital. She told me the gynaecology service for women in Cork has been neglected in the past decade. There are currently 4,058 women waiting for an outpatient appointment. It is the longest waiting list of all gynaecology units nationwide and is increasing by approximately 1,000 per year. It is also three times the size of the Cork University Hospital general surgery outpatient waiting list, with 35% of women waiting over a year for an outpatient appointment and many waiting two to three years.</p>, <p eid="para_575">Many women arrive in emergency rooms in crisis due to long waiting times. I have been told there is a risk of delayed diagnosis of cancers in women who are forced to wait for years for their outpatient assessment, and this is a clinical assessment of that. There are 518 women on a waiting list for surgery, 38% of whom have been waiting at least one year. Cork has the longest waiting list for gynaecological surgeries, being twice that of the Rotunda Hospital, which ranks second.</p>, <p eid="para_576"> In the past decade, no new consultant gynaecologist posts have been created in Cork, despite the fact that 26 such posts have been advertised nationwide in a one-year period during 2015 and 2016. Gynaecology theatres in CUMH are functioning at only 40% of their originally intended capacity. CUMH has two fully commissioned, state-of-the-art gynaecology theatres, only one of which is used for surgery and for just four days per week.</p>, <p eid="para_577"> I want to distinguish between gynaecology and maternity services. I anticipate that the Minister of State's reply may refer specifically to maternity services. I hope it will not. I refer specifically to gynaecology services and the lack of services for women's health. This is not a call for additional funding. The issue is one of governance and ensuring the HSE makes a greater effort to allow the services to be put in place. I do not believe for a minute that it is due to a lack of funding. It is due to a lack of will.</p>]
[<p eid="para_582">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. She spoke of some progress in the appointment of a sonographer and a clear schedule to clear the ultrasound waiting list by 2016. In that sense, I accept the Minister of State's reply. In raising the issue, I am trying to examine the governance issue regarding the relationship between CUMH and Cork University Hospital, CUH. Although the HSE will examine it as coming under the umbrella of CUH, it must be recognised as a separate governance procedure similar to other hospitals in the South-South West hospital group. We need to examine how we provide for the reduction in waiting times for women who have been waiting too long for access to services. We also need to examine the risk that is built in regarding the potential for the development of cancers as a result of overly long waiting times.</p>, <p eid="para_583"> I acknowledge the response. I ask the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, his colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy to interrogate the dynamic between those who manage CUMH from a HSE perspective and those who are clinical leads. At one stage, when we were going through a reconfiguration of hospitals in the Cork region, clinicians were taking the lead and decisions were being based on clinically led practice. Now, it has shifted back to the HSE. While I will speak to the Minister of Health myself about it, will the Minister of State convey to the Minister that we need to improve the gynaecological services in CUMH?</p>]
[<p eid="para_747">We support this motion. There are aspects of it worthy of further interrogation, particularly the publication by Grant Thornton of its report predicting that 450 to 500 post offices will cease to exist by 2017. I question that figure because the evidence during the past five years would not bear it out. It would take a major diminution in services for that figure to be borne out in real terms. Notwithstanding that, there is a problem. Are people in rural areas going into their local post offices to use their services or do they drive past them and go to the nearest town, urban conurbation or city?</p>, <p eid="para_748"> When I was a county councillor, I advocated strongly for young couples who wanted to build houses in rural areas. Between 2004 and 2007, I spent a great deal of time helping young people to obtain planning permission in rural areas where there are post offices. It is arguable, however, that most of those people do not use their local post offices but drive to the nearest town to avail of all the services available there. How do we disrupt that behaviour and incentivise people to develop a loyalty to their own local offices? That will be challenging. It will require behavioural change.</p>, <p eid="para_749"> An Post made a submission recently to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs setting out metrics. It has introduced the court fines payment system. It will extend the National Lottery service to all post offices nationwide. The State savings business is growing and is worth over â‚¬20 billion. It is talking about plans to enhance those services but will that translate into more people going into post offices to transact that business or will people prefer to do it online? Since March 2014, An Post has experienced a decline of over 11% in core mail usage. Since the peak of mail reached in 2007, it has experienced a 38% decline. There is behavioural change from posting letters to online transactions, particularly for Government services.</p>, <p eid="para_750"> I do not see the State directly subsidising individual post offices but a co-operative model for communities where the local post office is under threat has been mentioned. We had and still have a strong co-operative ethos in this State and I do not see why, with soft or hard supports, communities where there are offices at risk of closure, not being passed on to the next generation or with no uptake if somebody decides to retire, could not develop a social enterprise model. I do not know how many motions about rural post offices I have witnessed in the past ten years. If we can be progressive and expansive in our thinking and work with communities, we can see whether, short of direct subsidisation, we can build out a co-operative model. It is only one suggestion but it could be done on a trial basis in one or two communities. </p>, <p eid="para_751">If they feel strongly enough about their local post offices, and the surveys tell us that they do, then let us put that to the test and see if there are others ways of dealing with this issue. It it worth reading into the record again that which was stated by An Post. In March 2014, An Post said that it had more than 750,000 weekly Department of Social Protection customers. I know this has been mentioned already. This has now fallen to 625,000 customers, a decline of 17%. An Post has said that it was caused primarily by a decline of 30% in the number of jobseeker payments as people gained employment or moved onto schemes. An Post then experienced a reduction of 5% in pension payments due to the very low number of new pensioners choosing the post office option for their payments. I know that there were some tensions around that but we have to be honest: if people decide that they want their payments paid in a particular way, that is the choice of citizens.</p>, <p eid="para_752"> While we in the Labour Party support the motion, I do not take the dystopian view that post offices will be wiped out. We have seen a growth in the number of one-off rural houses and we have seen investment in schools in rural areas. What we need to do now is see how we can help communities, particularly those in sensitive areas, such as the ones that Deputy Pearse Doherty spoke about in his own native Gweedore. If we take that as an example, and there have been public meetings around this, perhaps it is one area that we could look at as a model in which stakeholders can come together to sustain the post office and roll in other services, not just post office-related services but other social services, to create the kind of hub that is so vital to the rural communities to which we refer in the context of the motion.</p>]
