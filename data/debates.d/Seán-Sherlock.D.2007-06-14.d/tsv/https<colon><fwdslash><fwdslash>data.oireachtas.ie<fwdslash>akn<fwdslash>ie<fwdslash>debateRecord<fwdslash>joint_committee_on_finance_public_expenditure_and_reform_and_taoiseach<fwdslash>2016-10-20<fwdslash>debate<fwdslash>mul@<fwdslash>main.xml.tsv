[<p eid="para_44">On Second Stage we assented to bring the Bill to this stage. One of the questions I have had on my mind for some time has been where the Central Bank is in respect of its position on mortgage pricing in Ireland. There was a report from 2015 but is there an updated report in that respect? I do not necessarily need the answer now. It seems there is a very clear position within the Central Bank on bank profitability. The report states that equity investors, whether the State or others, cannot be expected to inject capital if a return in the form of profits is not in prospect.</p>, <p eid="para_45">The report stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_46">That is why it is unrealistic to imagine a regime even in the long-run in which mortgage lending rates do not build in not only a sufficient spread (over the cost of funds) to cover the credit risk being undertaken, but also make an adequate contribution to profits. It is likely, however, that the rates in effect for most banks at the end of April 2015 [which is when the report was published] were higher than would be necessary in the long-run for a bank unburdened by a poorly performing mortgage back book.</p>, <p eid="para_47">Could we get a perspective from the Central Bank as to whether this view point has been updated? It would be pertinent regarding dealing with the issues of competition as elucidated by the Minister.</p>, <p eid="para_48"> There is an issue regarding how the property rights of some creditors would be affected. Can we have a deeper dive into the dynamic of the property rights as they affect those people who paid 6% or 7% on variable rates? In one case I am familiar with, it will add approximately â‚¬100,000 to the cost of the mortgage over its lifetime. I wonder how somebody like me could explain to the person that it is a constitutional issue in which the property rights of the bank or financial institution take precedence. It is a little unclear.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">Perhaps we could have an updated report from the Central Bank on the standing of the mortgage book in that respect. If there were an update of the May 2015 report Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland, it would be very useful.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">Is this a precedent in the history of the House?</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">The Minister has quoted from the document I referred to earlier. Specifically for the reasons outlined therein I asked for an update on the position. Given the Minister's intervention, it is clear that the <i>modus operandi </i>of the Central Bank is, to all intents and purposes in relation to mortgage lending, to take a<i> laissez-faire</i> approach. The question for us then is whether we can legislate for the cost of funds and a percentage over and above that. For the purposes of this engagement we are fairly clear at this juncture that there are two courses of action open to us in terms of our seeking legal advice and further engagement with the European Central Bank, ECB, on this matter. From my perspective, at this juncture we should move on.</p>]
