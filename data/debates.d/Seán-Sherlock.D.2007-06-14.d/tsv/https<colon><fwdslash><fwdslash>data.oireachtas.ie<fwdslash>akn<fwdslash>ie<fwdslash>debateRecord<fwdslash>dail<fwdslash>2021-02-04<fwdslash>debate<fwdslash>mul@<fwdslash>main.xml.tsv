There are queries coming into my office from parents of children who have very specific highly dependent needs and where carers are coming into the home or particular settings. They are asking me if any consideration is being given to vaccinating children within the "disability sector" - that might be an unfortunate use of that phrase but I mean where there is a high level of disability and dependency - so that we are vaccinating the child being cared for. Is there any discussion taking place around that cohort at Government level?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-04T13:30:00+00:00	I thank the Minister. I appreciate his response and I certainly will do that. We have sight of the survey that took place in relation to the early years sector, which I am sure the Ministers have also had sight of. Some 2,000 professionals took part in the survey. It found that 22% of early years educators earn more than the living wage of â‚¬12.30 per hour and 90% of all professionals struggle to make ends meet with difficulty or great difficulty. There is an online strike this Friday. The Ministers will be aware of that. We acknowledge that and give it our support, from a Labour Party perspective. I note the positive commentary in relation to the interaction with Dr. Duffy. I note the Minister's statement that he expects to receive a report within a matter of days. What will determine an outcome that will lead to a recommendation of an improvement in pay and conditions for workers? I doubt the report will, for instance, recommend the status quo remain. One could anticipate with some degree of common sense that there will be an advocacy of an improvement in pay and conditions. If there is such an outcome, how soon thereafter do the Government, the Ministers and the Department anticipate that they will act on those recommendations?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-02-04T13:30:00+00:00	It will be about money flowing into the sector if the Government decides to improve the pay and conditions. The question arises as to the balance of the onus: is the onus on the employer or on the Government through funding via the schemes into improving pay and conditions? That is the question that will be asked.
