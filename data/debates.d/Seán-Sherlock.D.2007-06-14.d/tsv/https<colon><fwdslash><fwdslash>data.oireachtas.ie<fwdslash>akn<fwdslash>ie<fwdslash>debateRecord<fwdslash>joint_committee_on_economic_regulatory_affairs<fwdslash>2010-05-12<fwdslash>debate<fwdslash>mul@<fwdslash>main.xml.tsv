SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome Mr. Raleigh and his colleagues and congratulate them on the report and its presentation.  It is succinct and its language is clear and unambiguous.  Very often in our game we have to wade through vast amounts of documentation so it is good to see a report that is clear in what it seeks to do without any ambiguity.I believe the last paragraph of the submission probably sums up the culture that exists in this country.  Do I understand there are plenty of codes — a vast quantum of code — which one can follow and buy into but are not necessarily backed up by a legislative framework in regard to corporate governance in this country?In the first paragraph on page 3 of the report Mr. Raleigh states:We believe this situation gives rise to the lack of a clear unified framework for companies to follow, potentially overlapping lines of responsibility among regulators and the perception of potential conflicts of interest.  The Stock Exchange, for example, is currently being asked to market the exchange, retaining existing companies and attracting new companies to its list, while also being required to monitor and ensure compliance with the combined code.Therefore the combined code exists.  It seems to me that the culture of compliance as it pertains to the vast bulk of companies seems to be quite strong but there still is a lag.  Do we need a more august body of legislation to ensure 100% compliance, bringing about a sea change in the culture and a change in the perception abroad of Irish companies?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is very clear.  In regard to the public interest entities —  the first time I have heard them referred to in that way is in the blurb — we might look at page 23 of the report on audit committees, in particular, on Anglo Irish Bank.  I do not know if the delegates have looked at Anglo.  I believe there is a reference to it as being covered.  It was nationalised at the time so I am not 100% clear whether it came under the ambit of the report.  We had a member of the audit committee of Anglo before this committee at one stage——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Internal audit.  I just want to get a sense of the distinctions between competences.  If recommendations for passing particular loans are made, for example, and the internal audit committee declares the loan represents a risk to the overall entity should there be clear rules about legislating for that or is some degree of flexibility needed?  The loan might be passed up the line with the board subsequently agreeing to its being slipped through because it needs to go through.What struck me when we were examining the culture within Anglo was that there was a fluidity across all competences, from chief executive down.  Although it is only one company there may be a perception that this culture pervades many other companies, especially in the banking sector.  Should there be clear, legislated-for rules or some code for cases where there is an inherent risk, where an internal audit committee says there is a risk to the overall entity if a particular loan is passed or a certain decision is made, even when officials feel they are acting in good faith?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to page 4 of the delegation's submission which states, "The often-stated assertion that there is not enough appropriately qualified directors in the Irish market should be challenged, not least because the increasing exposure of Irish companies to international markets means that Irish companies should seriously consider the level of international representation on their boards".  What does the delegation mean by that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is pertinent to make that statement in this hallowed institution.  The culture in this country is very much about connectivity, inter-relationships, who one is and who one represents and I am unsure how one could legislate for that.  I imagine it is rather difficult to put in place a rules-based structure because it is very subjective.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would Grant Thornton have done that for Kingspan, for instance?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To what extent will European Union rules have a bearing on changes to corporate governance structures?  Does the de Larosière report have a bearing on the changes we are discussing here or is that a separate process?
