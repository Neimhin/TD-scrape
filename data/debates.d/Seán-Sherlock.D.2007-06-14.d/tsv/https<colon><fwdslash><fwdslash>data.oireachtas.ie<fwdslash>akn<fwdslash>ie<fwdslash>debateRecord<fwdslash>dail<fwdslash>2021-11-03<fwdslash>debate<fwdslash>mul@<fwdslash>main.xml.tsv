SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-03T11:00:00+00:00	At this stage of the proceedings, further down the speaking slots, it allows time to read a Minister of State's speech and parse the words. In supporting this Bill, in the same spirit as we have always done, we would continue to support any initiatives that come before the House in respect of highlighting the continuing important presence of credit unions in our towns and villages throughout the country. In proposing an amendment to the Bill, the Minister of State states that it is deemed to be read a Second Time this day nine months to allow for the progression of the review of policy framework, which is at an advanced stage and for such progression to be taken into account in further scrutiny of this Bill. At face value, it would appear that he is seeking to engage with the proposer of the Bill and, pending the review, see where stands the Bill. However, when I quote from his speech, I am a little bit disturbed by some of the words, which suggest that the contrary is the case. He started by stating, "The potential legislative amendments will be considered as part of the review". The key point is his statement is:However, my engagements have highlighted that there is no firm consensus as to the desired legislative change which would assist in solving the financial challenges to the sector. I do not want to raise unrealistic expectations about the potential impact of any such change, if it were approved. I have been long enough around the House, including having served as a Minister of State, to recognise the coded language in that. That suggests that the Government has no intention whatsoever of promulgating this Bill. It may be that the only exercise if the Bill is to succeed is that the review has to be fast-tracked in a way that involves engagement with all of the stakeholders. Even if the pregnant pause, to use Deputy Connolly's expression, that has now replaced the guillotine is to be implemented as a tool, it is a coarse tool to use not to allow legislation to proceed to Committee Stage.  However, if the one thing that comes out of this is a fast-tracking of the review such that the stakeholders feel that they have been meaningfully engaged with, then that might not be such a bad thing. It is hard not to be cynical, however, because the Minister of State said, "I hope to update the House in the not too distant future of the Government's plan to support the credit union sector". There are too many ifs and buts. The language is nebulous.  We want concrete actions in respect of a sector that is vital to the functioning of this society. There are 3.6 million credit union members on the island of Ireland. There is €16.38 billion in savings and €19.28 billion in assets. I could go on. Credit unions have been consistently voted the best organisations for customer experience for the past seven years.  Credit union stakeholders are in and out of this House, through the committee structure, on a regular basis. What the Minister of State is hearing from all of us is a genuine plea to Government to engage with stakeholders in the credit union sector so that credit unions can lend productively within their communities. It is most patronising for him to come into the House and say:I would encourage them to engage more with local community groups, voluntary and sporting organisations to increase their lending. Its in keeping with their ethos and social value to the community.I am speechless at that remark.  The volunteers in credit unions know exactly what their ethos, mandate and mission are. They are doing this day in and day out. They are seeking to lend. However, now the very ethos that underpins the credit union movement is being hampered by regulatory overreach where, in certain circumstances, the Central Bank now controls whether the credit union can pay a dividend. This sticks in the craw of every reasonable and rational credit union member who ever was, including me.  Dividend restrictions on credit unions by the Central Bank have, by stealth, undermined the ethical basis through which credit unions were created. There was a time when Fianna Fáil would have stood up to the Central Bank on issues like this. There was a time when Fianna Fáil would have pushed back against the Central Bank on this. The way to push back against the Central Bank on this now is to put in place a proper policy framework so that credit unions can realise their full potential throughout Ireland and within the very communities that we represent. I do not know what the modus operandi of the Central Bank is, but is high time that we reach a point where it and the Department of Finance pull back a little and consider the potential of the sector. Given the stark reduction in the number of credit unions throughout the State, there is the danger of an existential threat to their very existence in some of the communities mentioned here today where banks have gone to ground. There is no oversight of the Central Bank by other central banks in respect of the regulation of credit unions.  I reiterate the point about dividend restrictions. There is no other country in western Europe where there have been transformational changes in governance in credit unions. Those involved are volunteers who have gone through a process and have done everything that has been asked of them in terms of governance and meeting requirements. It is time to give them a fair chance, take the foot off their necks and let them thrive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-03T12:40:00+00:00	The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has published a report on urban wastewater treatment. Raw sewage is being discharged from 34 towns and villages. We are told construction will start on 14 locations this year and eight in 2022. A third of these towns and villages will continue to release raw sewage after 2024. The report identifies a number of locations specifically in Cork. Cobh, thankfully, is to be resolved this year, but Ballycotton, Whitegate, Aghada and Mitchelstown are planned for later in the decade, as is Inchigeelagh. The EPA's concern is that repeated plans over the years have not been acted upon. This is not just an ecological and environmental issue. The lack of these facilities is also impacting on the housing crisis. For many young people with mortgage approval in towns like Mitchelstown where there are capacity constraints who wish to see houses built and where builders with sites are ready to go, the EPA report makes for very grim reading. I ask the Taoiseach to give this his priority.

SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:40:00+00:00	There will be an opportunity to come in during the questions and answers session.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:40:00+00:00	You are encroaching the time allocated to Deputy Connolly. I will let in the Deputy again during the questions and answers session.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:40:00+00:00	That concludes the speaking slots and 20 minutes are now allocated for a questions and answers session. There is a protocol whereby we will move through various groups in the Opposition. Questions have been raised and I propose to move now to the Sinn Féin allocation of time in this session. We can then move through the various Members.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:50:00+00:00	I propose to allocate five minutes for the Minister of State to conclude after the 20-minutes slot, but that is probably not enough time for him to wrap up and answer all the questions.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:50:00+00:00	I therefore propose to stick with the order of speakers and move to the questions and answers session. I am hopeful there will be enough time at the end. Perhaps ten minutes within the 20-minute slot will be sufficient for the Minister of State to respond to the other questions.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:50:00+00:00	Before the Minister of State addresses the questions, I wish to clarify that I propose to go to People Before Profit-Solidarity, the Regional Group, the Rural Independent Group and the Independent Group.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T15:50:00+00:00	I call Deputy Boyd Barrett. If we can be as concise as possible, we will get more in.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T16:00:00+00:00	More people will have a second chance to come in if the Deputy allows the Minister of State to answer.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T16:00:00+00:00	I now propose to move to the Rural Independent Group. If we can keep our questions concise, more people will be allowed to come in afterwards.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2021-11-03T16:00:00+00:00	There are less than two minutes left in this component of the debate. The Minister of State stated earlier that he wanted some time to address the questions raised by other Members. I propose that we do that now. After this slot, there is a further five minutes for the Minister of State to respond to the debate in total.
