SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 132 together.The public consultation process referred to attracted more than 50 submissions from interested parties on this subject.  Several of these submissions contained legal arguments in regard to the issue as well as comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments were forwarded by my Department to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.I consider that there is further work to be done on the issue between my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.It is an issue on which there is interaction between rights holders, the internet service providers (ISPS) and the end users, of whom there are millions.We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct in this area. I have been holding discussions with a number of the stakeholders, in this regard, and I hope to be in a position to finalise this matter by the middle of January 2012.
