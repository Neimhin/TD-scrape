SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	While I am not a member of the committee, I appreciate the Chairman giving me some time to make a contribution. I also appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State.  I will start with the Minister of State's last comment to the effect that the Government of the day had accepted the anti-fracking legislation. It was passed with the goodwill of the Members of the House on a unanimous basis. There were no dissenting voices. If one takes the view that fracking, by its very nature, is subject to licences and exploration, a term I use loosely, it is surely the case that the same concept and understanding could be applied to exploration offshore. Is that not the case? That is my first question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	The principles the Government applied in dealing with the issue of fracking and its support, as the Minister of State stated, for anti-fracking legislation included issues related to climate action, the injurious effect on the environment and the disturbance caused for communities. At least two of these three principles can be applied to the Bill under discussion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	I take the point made by the Minister of State. However, if revenues forgone from the issue of licences is the justification for requiring a money message to prevent the Bill from proceeding to the next Stage, why was the same principle not applied to the fracking legislation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	There were licences. Why is the same principle that was applied to the anti-fracking legislation not being applied to this Bill if the Government of the day had, in fact, issued the licences in the first instance?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:30:00+01:00	I am not sure I accept that answer which warrants further exploration. However, I realise we do not have a great deal of time.  My second question is related to the process of examining what defines a money message for the purpose of allowing a Bill to proceed to the next Stage. I do not intend to get into an interpretation of the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, except to say there is a memorandum of understanding between all Members of the House and the Government of the day on Private Members' Bills.It is arguable that the Government has contravened the spirit of that memorandum of understanding and it is arguable that it has been disrespectful to the individual Members of this House who have brought forward legislation. What is the process, in the simplest terms? I do not understand what the Minister of State needs to do to define this for the purposes of justifying the Government's argument on what needs to be done to deliver or not on the money message. What does the Minister of State need to do to justify his position with regard to the requirement for a money message?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	The Ceann Comhairle has determined that a money message is required. That is my understanding. For a money message to be delivered on, it is not the Ceann Comhairle who will go and do that business but the Government. What needs to be done to deliver the money message or not deliver it, depending on the Minister of State's justification? I suspect the Government has already made its decision and is seeking now to quash this legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	What does that mean?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	I appreciate that but the question is how the Government makes that determination. What criteria does the Government use in making that decision? Does it look at the opportunity cost forgone in respect of licences? What is the process? If I introduce legislation about health or education and I am told that it requires a money message because there is a charge on the Exchequer, whether a first order charge or an incidental charge, if I am the proposer of the legislation, surely I am entitled to know exactly what the Government intends to do with the legislation that I have drafted, as per Deputy Smith's contention, and how the Government intends to deliver the money message? What is the process and mechanism that the Government must now follow to decide on a money message? If that question cannot be answered, then I would contend that there has been a subversion of the democratic process here.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	I ask for a further articulation of that to be given to this committee with regard to what exactly that means. It would be useful for me as a Member of this House to understand that process, which I do not understand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	That is fair enough.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	I understand that a reasoned opinion and justification would be given. I am seeking to understand, within the Minister of State's line Department, the criteria when the Secretary General or assistant secretary generals and principal officers sit down to go through this process. We must now report to the Dáil on our decision about the delivery of a money message. What are the criteria about the decision on the delivery of a money message? What criteria are we setting out internally for the justification of our position, regardless of what that is? I do not expect the Minister of State to answer that now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	That is not what I am saying.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	This is my final intervention. I thank the Chair and Deputy Bríd Smith. It is worthwhile, because we have a Minister of State in front of us, to question the Minister of State in respect of the internal dynamics of the process of examining the money message procedure from his Department's point of view. The Ceann Comhairle has written on this. The Department must now respond.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	The Department.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	May I make a final intervention?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-11T16:40:00+01:00	The point was made earlier that this should not be caught up as a geopolitical issue. I contend that it is a geopolitical issue. Organisations such as Trócaire are advocating on behalf of this legislation. It is an organisation that is funded from the public purse, which seeks to bridge the divide between the global north and the global south. It seeks to advocate on issues such as the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals and in respect of how the global north does its business and how that has a significant impact on the poorest people living on the planet. I suggest that this legislation is germane to this very issue and that is a point I want to address with regard to Senator O'Reilly's earlier point. It is very germane to a geopolitical context.
