[<p eid="para_51">I, too, welcome this comprehensive presentation, from which many questions arise.</p>, <p eid="para_52">In terms of the draft directive's objectives, will specific pesticides in common use be banned?  If one of the objectives set out by the European Commission is to improve the behaviour of pesticide users by ensuring better training and education, will every pesticide user in the land, regardless of profession, require certification?  Is this matter to be returned for a Second Reading at the Council of Ministers?  Are there stumbling blocks between the European Parliament's reading of the directive, the Second Reading by the Council of Ministers and where the issue stands?  The officials' assessment states the text of the agreement will be finalised in the official languages of the European Union with a view to its formal adoption by the Council.  Is this a <i>fait accompli</i> or must negotiations be undertaken before the Second Reading by the Council and the directive is placed before the European Parliament again?</p>, <p eid="para_53">This issue arose from the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community 2002 â€” 2012 and was, therefore, a matter that could have been foreseen.  Those involved in the food industry and agri-business may fear that the directive will be so prescriptive regarding practices that they will experience unnecessary costs.  We all recognise that the use of pesticides must be regulated but my questions remain.</p>]
