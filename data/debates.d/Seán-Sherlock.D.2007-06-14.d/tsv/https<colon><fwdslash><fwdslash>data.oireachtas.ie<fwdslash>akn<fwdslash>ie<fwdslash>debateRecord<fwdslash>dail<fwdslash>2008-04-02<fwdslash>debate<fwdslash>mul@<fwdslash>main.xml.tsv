SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Ceann Comhairle will regret his confidence.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When will the acute hospitals review be published?  When will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be published?  A publication date of 2009 is given.  This acute hospitals review will have serious permutations in terms of the delivery of hospital services in places such as Mallow General Hospital.  The Ceann Comhairle should know that we are awaiting this review because of its serious permutations for Mallow.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a procedural matter, if I raise it under Standing Order 32 it will not be taken and neither will it be taken if I seek to raise it on Adjournment.  I am a Member for Cork East and I want to raise the issue of Mallow General Hospital, but I am being told I cannot do so.  They are diminishing the services to the hospital by stealth as we speak.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	A review report is sitting in the national hospitals office of the Health Service Executive, of which we do not have sight.  Before that report is even issued——-
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——they are diminishing the hospital services.  The people of Mallow and its catchment area will be without a hospital before long and I do not have the wherewithal to raise the issue here.
