[<p eid="para_23">That would be my intention. I wish to speak for people who are living in private rented accommodation throughout this State, much of which is substandard. Many of these people are on local authority housing lists. I do not want to be overtly political about this or seek to score points. I am not raising this issue for the purposes of putting a clip up on Facebook. I merely wish to raise the matter on the basis of the increasing number of people contacting me who are living in what can be only described as hovels which have passed muster for the purposes of the housing assistance payment, HAP, but in respect of which there does not appear to be a proper inspection regime. I am not seeking to apportion blame. I merely wish to speak for these people.</p>, <p eid="para_24">In one instance, a family came to tell me about mould and damp on the walls. There are all sorts of public health issues arising from that, with children presenting with severe respiratory illnesses as a result of living in substandard accommodation. If the inspection regime was buttressed and kick-started, that would help the situation.</p>, <p eid="para_25"> In a parliamentary reply to my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, in respect of Cork, it was stated that up to September 2020 there were 611 inspections carried out. A total of 601 improvement letters were issued on foot of those inspections. Similarly, up to September 2020, in Cork city 434 inspections were carried out, 96 improvement letters were issued and one improvement notice was issued. The local authorities are at the pin of their collars in trying to manage this service. It is unfair to expect them to do more with less in terms of the number of employees who are tasked with this job, in respect of whole-time equivalence as to personnel.</p>, <p eid="para_26"> In the absence of an adequate supply of social housing stock - a supply issue which will pertain for the foreseeable future – the inspection regime should be robust. If a landlord acts immorally or unethically in relation to his or her tenants, and does not meet the terms and conditions of the legislation as laid down by this House, the inspection regime should be robust and enforce the legislation so that landlords carry out their obligations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_32">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I welcome the fact that this is on the Department’s agenda in the context of providing increased funding. I would argue, however, that while an increase to €10 million from €2.5 million is dramatic, when one factors in a county like Cork, I am not sure how far €10 million would go if it was extrapolated out across all counties. I ask that this be looked at again.</p>, <p eid="para_33"> We all know landlords; they live among us. Ninety-nine per cent of the landlords I have met are very good and decent people who want to ensure that their tenants are protected and that they live in accommodation of a proper standard. They are very proud of the fact they have long-term tenancies and agreements with letters, and so on. However, there are a small minority who I would describe as slum landlords. In one instance, someone approached me last week to say they had asked for a simple repair and were told that if they did not like it, that they could sling their hook. The landlord in that case is in receipt of a supplement or subvention from the State in respect of the property involved. That is the mere point.</p>, <p eid="para_34"> There is a moral and ethical argument here in the context of tenants who cannot get local authority houses at present because of a lack of supply. These are tenants of long standing. Some are happy to maintain their arrangements if the repairs can be carried out. There needs to be a follow up for those people as to the inspection regime. I am very conscious that we are in this pandemic, however, I make the case and highlight the fact that the inspection regime needs to be kick-started as soon as we can.</p>]
[<p eid="para_169">I support the motion and congratulate Deputy Nolan and her colleagues on bringing it before us.</p>, <p eid="para_170"> Members should spare a thought for the many fishers who are in Cork at the moment. A flotilla has arrived in Cork Harbour. I wish to acknowledge the wonderful way in which they have organised the event. They are primary producers as well, of a fashion, and are deserving of our support and attention. I hope they will be successful in their travails throughout the day and that they will get to meet the Taoiseach.</p>, <p eid="para_171"> There is an elephant in the room in respect of beef, namely, the current negotiations between the United Kingdom and Australia on a zero-tariff and zero-quota agreement that could be concluded next month. My understanding is they are teeing it up for the G7 summit in Cornwall. I am fearful about that deal because it will have major consequences for Irish primary producers, including Irish beef and sheep farmers. If the deal concludes, the permutations are such that it will allow Australia to ship beef and lamb without tariff to the United Kingdom. I am really concerned about how that will impact on Irish exports to the UK. Notwithstanding the current travails in respect of Brexit, I am fearful that the conclusion of such a UK-Australia free trade agreement would have even more untold and negative consequences for Irish primary producers. I am keen to hear the Government perspective on this deal and what kind of forward planning the Government is doing to mitigate the effects for Irish farmers.</p>, <p eid="para_172"> We know the nature of farming in Australia. They have factory farms to all intents and purposes. If they are able to export to the UK it will have dire consequences for United Kingdom farmers and for Irish farmers. We wish to know the permutations, what real-time planning is taking place and what mitigation measures the Government will undertake to ensure Irish farmers are supported. If there is a significant loss of income and loss of what is a vital market, what is the Government doing to offset that potential loss? We have to hear from Government on its plans in that regard. It is a vital issue and one deserving of attention. It speaks to the heart of the motion before us today.</p>, <p eid="para_173"> I wish to raise the issue of market access to China. Will the Minister outline the status of export beef to China at present? It would be useful to know the value in euro terms and the status of our trading relationship with China at present in respect of beef exports. It is a growing market and a vital one, given the primacy of Irish beef. I hope we will not be locked out of that market for too much longer. It would be useful for Irish farmers in the export game to know the status of that market. It would be useful for them to know where the Government is at present in its diplomatic efforts to restore and enhance that market.</p>, <p eid="para_174"> We need to hear from the Government in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy. We know that many farmers will farm to schemes. We know there is an inevitability about the fact that climate action measures will be writ large across the next CAP agreement. The agreement has to come on the basis of ensuring financial supports for farmers. We must be honest about this. If there is to be an incentive provided for farmers to move into agri-environmental schemes supported by the Government and the European Union, then there needs to be clarity on what that means and what the permutations will be for farm incomes. I refer to farm incomes for the type of farmers we are discussing today, namely, farmers who are farming on a marginal income and who are wholly dependent on a market price. They will need continuing subvention to support their incomes if they are to be guardians of the countryside, to use the often-quoted phrase. Incentives will have to be provided to ensure that income is supplemented where loss of income is perceived or projected.</p>, <p eid="para_175"> I will speak briefly to the reality of where the market is at present. I understand that the export benchmark price that was negotiated, discussed or landed upon in the context of the beef sector agreement is currently, at 2020 prices, approximately €3.55 per kilo. I am told that the Bord Bia prime cattle price for exports was approximately €3.56, or effectively 1 cent more. I would like to hear from the Minister where the Government sees the projected price of beef being one year from now, taking CAP and the UK-Australia agreement into account. What are the future projections and what plans is the Government making to ensure there is adequate support for the sector and individual family farms?</p>]
