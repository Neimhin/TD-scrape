SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:30:00+00:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Dara Murphy.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:30:00+00:00	I thank the Senator. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some matters before resuming in public session. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:40:00+00:00	We are considering public petitions. The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00028/18. We propose to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(2)(b). Is that agreed? Agreed. Next is Petition No. P00034/18. We propose to forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00035/18. We propose to forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition is Petition No. P00044/18 from Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan. This has been the source of some discussion. The petition concerns the official Dublin Christmas tree lighting ceremony, which is not going ahead. The petitioner states that there has been no crowd trouble in the past and he does not anticipate any in future. I note that when the committee was in private session committee members expressed some views on the matter. I will open the floor to Senator Buttimer.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:50:00+00:00	I think there is unanimity on this issue. We should keep Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan's petition open. I am getting a direction to the effect that we should correspond with Dublin City Council. I suggest we say to it that we do not accept the correspondence it has furnished to the committee. It states in it that the traditional location for the Christmas lights switching-on ceremony was on O'Connell Street. It seems it does not want to inconvenience people by asking the operator of the Luas cross-city line to stop operating it in order to accommodate the ceremony. Moreover, it seems there have been issues in managing the large crowds which have attended the lighting ceremony in recent years. The council has also stated it has created winter lights in Dublin city and brought Christmas lights and building projections to more locations and people than ever before. I think we all accept that the council is trying to do its best. Let us suppose I was a first, second, third or fourth generation Dubliner and going to see the switching on of the lights. It is a real family event, something that is synonymous with Dublin at Christmas time. It is firmly the view of the committee that some mechanism should be found to facilitate the process.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:50:00+00:00	There is no cross-city Luas line in Cork.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-11-21T13:50:00+00:00	There are no cars in Cork either in that area, but sin sc√©al eile. It is clearly the view of the committee that it has been progressive in seeking to make suggestions. Senator Buttimer's suggestion is laudable and one that could be communicated to Dublin City Council. The petition remains open and we will correspond with the council. We thank the petitioner, Mr. Darryl O'Callaghan, for having the wherewithal to address the issue to us. I propose that the committee adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 5 December. I thank members for their attendance.
