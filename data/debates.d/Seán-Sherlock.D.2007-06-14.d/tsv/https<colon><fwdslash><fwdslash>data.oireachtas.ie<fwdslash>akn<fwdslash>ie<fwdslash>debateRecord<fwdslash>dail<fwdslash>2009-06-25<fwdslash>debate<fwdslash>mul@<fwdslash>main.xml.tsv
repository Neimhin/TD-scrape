SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	My questions relate to more pedestrian matters.  When will Committee Stage of the Fines Bill be taken?  Why has the animal health and welfare Bill not been published?  If the Minister for Finance is not in a position to give me an answer, I ask for some written direction as to when it will be published.  We have been waiting for more than two years for this Bill.  It is turning into a farce.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 63:
In page 39, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:"(a) procedures for the rapid termination of the tenancy of any household where a member or members of that household have engaged in anti-social behaviour;”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 66:
In page 40, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(6) Without prejudice to any power conferred by the Act of 1997 or otherwise, a housing authority may without notice terminate the tenancy of any tenant who has engaged in anti-social behaviour.".
