[<p eid="para_178">Let me first state that I apologise for not being able to engage with the Senator as proficiently as possible through the medium of Irish.  Perhaps that is a reflection on the rota of Ministers who reply and perhaps he should have been afforded the opportunity of a full reply as gaeilge.</p>, <p eid="para_179">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Senator about DEIS status for Pobal Scoil Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal and scholarships for Gaeltacht students.  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and inspectorate.  Second level schools were selected by reference to centrally held data from the post-primary pupils and the State Examinations Commission databases.  The identification process was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available.  The school referred to by the Senator was not selected for inclusion in DEIS.  A review mechanism was put in place that did not quality for inclusion in the school support programme under DEIS.  An appeal by the school to the independent review body confirmed that the level of disadvantage did not warrant its inclusion in the DEIS process.  None of the existing schools that was unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review process was ever admitted to the DEIS programme.  A key priority for the Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant given the economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure.  It also reduces the capacity for any additions to the DEIS programme, including the selection of further schools.</p>, <p eid="para_180">As announced in the 2012 budget, five scholarship schemes for higher education, namely the Easter Week 1916 commemoration scholarship scheme, an scéim scoláireachtaí tríú leibhéal do scoláirí ón nGaeltacht, an scéim scoláireachtaí gaeilge tríú leibhéal neamh-theoranta, an scéim scoláireachtaí tríú leibhéal and the Donogh O'Malley scholarship scheme will be replaced with a new single scheme of bursaries based on merit and financial need.  These earlier scholarships, with one exception, were awarded without the application of socio-economic criteria.  The new bursaries are specifically designed to target students attending DEIS schools in disadvantaged areas and also indicating a level of personal or family disadvantage by virtue of having qualified for a medical card.  The bursary will be an extra support and incentive to recognise high achievement for students from disadvantaged families and attending DEIS schools.  The change was made to make the best use of the limited funds we have available for bursaries in order to focus on the best performing students in the cohort of those who are most in need of financial help.  It is envisaged that 60 students will receive a bursary this September and the number will rise over each of next three years with more than 350 students per year benefiting by 2015.  These changes will not impact on those who already hold scholarships under the existing schemes and the principal financial support made available by the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate access to third level education continues to be the means tested student grant.</p>, <p eid="para_181">Other financial measures to support broader access and participation include the provision of the special rate of maintenance grant for students from welfare dependent families and the availability of the student assistant fund at college level to assist students in particular financial difficulties.  From the academic year 2012-13 onwards grants will be centrally administered by a single grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, a division of the City of Dublin VEC.  SUSI will administer the student grants scheme on behalf of the Department.  A new online-only grant application system has also been introduced to facilitate applications.</p>]
[<p eid="para_187">I acknowledge the point made by the Senator but there cannot be a geographical bias for bursaries either.  We must have regard for the economic circumstances that we find ourselves in.</p>]
