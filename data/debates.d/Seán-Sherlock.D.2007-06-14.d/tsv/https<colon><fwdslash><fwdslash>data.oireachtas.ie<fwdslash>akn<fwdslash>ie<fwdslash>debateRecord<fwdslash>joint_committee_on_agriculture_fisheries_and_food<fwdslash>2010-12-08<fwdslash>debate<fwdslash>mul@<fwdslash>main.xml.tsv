SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would it be acceptable if members were allowed to put questions on the section of the report to which Professor Boyle has just referred?  Would it be appropriate to deal with the report on a section by section basis?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy for coming before us.  There is a clear message being sent to the committee - via the statement presented by Professor Boyle - in respect of the advisory service.  The question that arises is whether a properly funded State advisory service should remain in place or a privatised model should be adopted.  A political challenge arises in that regard.  We must take cognisance of the fact that if we are to achieve the targets relating to Food Harvest 2020, a strong advisory service will be required.  Such a service is already in place at Teagasc.  As already stated, there is a challenge to be met and we must be aware of it.  The position is self-explanatory in that sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Deputy Edward O'Keeffe.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I do not need a pat on the head.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is what I call progress.  From our perspective we are beginning to drill down into the Food Harvest 2020 report and recognise the challenges facing us arising from it.  As we see it, we have set ourselves political targets which in themselves present serious challenges.  The challenges have been summarised, but the question that comes to my mind relates to the improved restructuring of land.  From the research I have carried out, the number of farms has decreased from 223,000 in 1980 to 170,000 in 1991 to 128,000 in 2007.  The average farm size has increased to 32.3 hectares.  If we are to achieve the economies of scale necessary to achieve the targets, then obviously, as stated in the submission, there must be an improved restructuring of land.  The question that follows is whether there is recognition by farm owners or land owners as to the need to restructure the land.  If that restructuring is to take place, how will it take place?  Will it take place through farm partnerships or some type of collectivisation?  I do not mean that in a loaded political sense of the word.  Are we talking about people selling their holdings to achieve those economies of scale?  Will the traditional family farm - which is an emotive term - as we know it cease to exist to achieve those targets that are necessary?  The next question is how does one get farmers to take up new technologies to achieve the efficiencies and the returns that are necessary.  If the demographic is older and the age profile is older now, how do we achieve a greater throughput of younger farmers who are more inclined to taking up the challenges than the more traditional farmers?  Perhaps I am wrong - perhaps older farmers are more open minded to scientific knowledge.  My perception is that the older one is and the longer one is in the sector, the more traditional is the individual's output and the less likely one is to take on board new technologies to improve one's holdings.  There are a great many challenges.  What I am driving at is whether there is a view in Teagasc as to how these targets can be achieved in practice.  What is the political input and what decisions need to be taken by policy makers with a view to achieving these targets?I am a regular reader of the Teagasc magazine  Today’s Farm.  I find it invaluable and the T research document that comes out on a regular basis is invaluable as far as I am concerned.   In one article on greenhouse gases in the current edition where Mark Gibson, the environment specialist in Athenry talks about the international research.  He states that international research has established that the fairest and most accurate way of measuring greenhouse gas emissions is on a per unit product basis so that for example total greenhouse gas emissions from a litre of milk or a kilogramme of meat by reducing the carbon footprint of our produce would enable all countries to compete on a level playing pitch and work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from global agriculture.  If I track back from there as a layman, the question is what research is going on, how is the multidisciplinary internal working group working at the moment to achieve those targets and is there something concrete arising from it that will feed into the end game or the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020,  to which we all subscribe at some level.  Greenhouse gases, as far as I am concerned, are one of the major challenges and I know there is a great deal of work going on in Moorepark on that issue.  That is well recognised and well established.  The question is whether we will achieve the targets and where are we scientifically in that sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will make a brief point and I accept that it is somewhat tangential in nature.  I refer to carbon leakage and the issues raised in Mr. Mark Gibson's article in Today’s Farm.  The question that arises for many people outside the committee is whether we should reduce the numbers in the national herd.  My view is that, particularly for economic reasons, we should not do so.  There is also a scientific opinion which indicates that, because of carbon leakage, we should not do so.  Will Dr. Hennessy provide a brief outline regarding how Teagasc defines carbon leakage?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Dr. Hennessy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When I asked to speak about the artisan food sector issue, I wanted to get a sense of whether there was a formal structure within Teagasc and the sector.  I was not sure what the existing structure was and my question was answered.
