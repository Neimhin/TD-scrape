SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I apologise for my late arrival due to travelling up from Cork.  I note the presence of Mr. Louis Duffy and am sure that with the number of Cork people present, he must feel this meeting is a bit like a meeting of Cork County Council.  He is probably wondering why he came so far for it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Exactly.  I note the submission from Cork County Council and will speak on that, but there is no point in me addressing the submissions of other local authorities because the only one on which I can speak with some authority is the Cork one.  The question facing us is whether, if the coming winter is similar to that of last year, we will see similar abandonment of horses as happened last year.  There is no evidence to suggest matters will be any different this coming winter.  We cannot lay the blame at the door of the local authorities because they are doing everything they can to try to alleviate the problem.  The issue is how to ensure responsible ownership.  The type of horse abandoned in north Cork in particular was the typical piebald horse.  A question arises, therefore, as to whether members of the Traveller community adequately ensure their horses are identifiable in compliance with legislation.  It is fair to surmise, without being racist or prejudiced, that this is the problem.  How can we ensure everyone who owns a horse, no matter their class, creed or origin, complies with the law on ownership of animals?  Is microchipping being policed?  If not, how can it be policed and has the State the resources to police it?I do not believe in the notion of giving irresponsible owners a slaughter premium so that they can create another market.  People must take responsibility for the animals they have purchased from day one and now that there is an excess supply of horses, they or others should not benefit from slaughter premia to get rid of the problem.  We need to tackle the issues and find some mechanism to ensure horses will be traceable from birth and that owners can be readily identified.  Where such horses are abandoned, punitive measures should be taken against the owner without prejudice.  I suspect the pound operated by Cork County Council in Carrignavar will be full again this year, despite this discussion, unless the Government takes control of and grapples with the issue once and for all.
