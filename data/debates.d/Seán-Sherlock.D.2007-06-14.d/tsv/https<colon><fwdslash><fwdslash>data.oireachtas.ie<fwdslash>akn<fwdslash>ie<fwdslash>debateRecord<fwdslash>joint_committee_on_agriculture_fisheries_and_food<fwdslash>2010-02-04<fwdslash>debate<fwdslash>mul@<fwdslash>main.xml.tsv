SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I welcome the members of Teagasc.  While there have been several attempts to bring them before the committee, it is good to see that they are here, finally.On the whole area of research and the McCarthy report proposals for one centralised research body with the various interests seeking to draw from centralised funding, what will the permutations of that proposal be for Teagasc, if it is implemented?  In terms of Teagasc's current research function, what percentage of the proposals actually come to fruition within the marketplace or in the agricultural sector  per se?I am a rational person, although not a scientist.  As a layman I understand that while there are many proposals in scientific research, many of them could fall by the wayside, with research ending up in a blind alley.  I am trying to get a sense from Teagasc as to how applicable much of its research may be in real terms, the budget lines and whether these are warranted and if a case could be made against the proposals in the McCarthy report.  Obviously, it will be the task of politicians down the line to make decisions as to how such funding is designated.  I would like the views of the delegates on that.I would also like to hear about the intellectual property rights in research being carried out by Teagasc.  While I realise it is looking for more effective ways of interacting with the food industry, and successful and commercially viable proposals might arise from that, the question is who will hold the intellectual property rights, in the event, and whether the food industry is getting a cheap advantage which it could turn into a large profit.  Can anything be clawed back by Teagasc in the event of such effort becoming commercially viable?Could somebody please tell me what is going on in the local offices, in Mallow, for instance?  I shall be accused of being somewhat parochial in this regard, but it is probably typical of some other offices around the country.  We are told that it could be moved to Fermoy or Mitchelstown and the staff are somewhat confused about what is going on.  They do not know what the future holds for them.  Could somebody please clarify the future of the Mallow office?Also, on the advisory services in particular, if there is a 40% reduction in staff in this area, will this give rise to the 12% projected decline, or has this been factored in?  I refer to the advisory office rationalisation proposal.  By the end of 2012, the report says, there is expected to up to a 40% reduction in all advisory service staff, and the projected decline in numbers is in the order of 12%.  I just wonder about the exact correlation there and again, perhaps, Teagasc might clarify this.Are we handing over the advisory services to the agricultural consultants association or such bodies and in the event, can a mix of two such areas of expertise effectively co-exist?  I am reluctant to hand over such a service to one or two entities and believe that a strong capability exists within the service as it is.  A 40% reduction in all advisory service staff is a dangerous departure and I would not like to see this.  While I can understand the need for rationalisation, an excellent service is being provided within these local offices.Teagasc has hit the nail on the head, however, in terms of my way of thinking on advocating that the service should be near the client.  In particular, with the Mallow proposals, there is the question as to whether the service will be moved further away from its client catchment area.  If we are talking about the client, ultimately, the service has to be near him or her.  Forgive me if I sound parochial, but I am using Mallow as a benchmark for other offices.On the agricultural colleges, we need a further explanation of the transfer of undertakings.  My impression of Pallaskenry is that it comprises Teagasc staff employed within that college.  There is no ambiguity in my mind about that.  Perhaps I can be forgiven if an incorrect impression was conveyed to the committee on that matter.  I shall leave it at that.
