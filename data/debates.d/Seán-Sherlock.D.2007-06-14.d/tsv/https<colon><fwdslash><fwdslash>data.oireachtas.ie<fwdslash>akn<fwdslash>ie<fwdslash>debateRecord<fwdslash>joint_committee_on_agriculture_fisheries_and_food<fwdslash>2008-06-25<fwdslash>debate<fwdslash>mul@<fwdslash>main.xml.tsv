SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Mr. Gunning for his presentation, which contains much to digest.  I will confine my contribution to making three or four points.  The work of Coillte is regarded positively.  It has a clear operational structure and a mandate to try to maximise the potential of wood and forestry in the State.  However, speaking as layman, one senses from the figures that there is much greater potential to maximise the return from forestry, given the lands held by the company and the markets for wood related products, whether for sustainable energies and fuels, construction or other areas.Based on a €40 million profit on a turnover of €318 million, which is predicated on the Medite acquisition, and given the slowdown in construction, what are the projections for profit in 2008 and 2009?  Perhaps my analysis is wrong but the Medite acquisition will create a blip in the company's books.  Will profits decline in the next two or three years?To be parochial, I have a particular interest in the Ballyhoura Mountains as I trek regularly in that area and the Galtee Mountains.  I wonder whether the clear potential for forest parks is being fully exploited.  Mr. Gunning indicated the forest park in Ballyhoura is operated at a cost and does not deliver a return on investment, save the social benefit which accrues from it.  He also stated the UK Government pays the Forestry Commission £1 per visitor.  In the context of increasing urbanisation, perhaps the Government should consider introducing a similar scheme here.  Forests will become natural playgrounds for families.  I think especially of the Ballyhoura project and the mountain bike trails, which is a fantastic resource.  Friends of mine come from far and wide to use the trails.  I sense that this aspect of forestry is still at an early stage and that it has even greater potential.  Does Coillte have the potential to build infrastructure around those projects?  For instance, there is the Griffner Coillte partnership.  Is there any scope to develop a residential component or visitor centres within forests to encourage people living in urban areas to visit and holiday in or adjacent to forests?  I am merely throwing out ideas.Given that forestry in Ireland comprises 10% of the total land area and that the EU average is 44%, what is Coillte's position on the acquisition of land and is there scope for greater land acquisition?  I accept that the current price of land is prohibitive.  Wood could become the new gold in the sense that it has boundless potential, especially taking into account the potential for forestry and wind energy on Coillte's land holdings.  This could help to offset our carbon footprint but there is also scope to make money from the development of the economic potential.  The €40 million profit in 2007 seems small given the potential of the assets in question.  I would like to see greater exploitation of the resource.  What can we as legislators do to assist Coillte to add value, or what Government policy needs to be implemented in order to increase the potential further?I represent a constituency that is largely urban but there is a strong rural mix.  There is some mountainous area among the low land and a lot of the land in the constituency of Cork East belongs to Coillte.  Does Coillte have the power to diversify further into the broadband market if broadband is not being provided through fibre optic or Eircom exchanges?  Coillte could step in where there are variations in topography.  Does Coillte have the potential to become involved in that regard or is it only capable of allowing access to its lands?  I would like to see Coillte become directly involved in the market if it has the wherewithal to do so.I welcome today's presentation.  We all know people who traditionally worked in forestry.  One can see that forestry has diversified from just growing trees.  I would like to see more diversification and I can see great potential for it.  I welcome the fact that Coillte appears to be going in that direction, which is very encouraging.  I thank Coillte's representatives for their contribution.
