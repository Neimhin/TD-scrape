SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-04-16T17:20:00+01:00	I am taking this important matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who wishes me to convey his apologies to the House regarding the fact that he is not able to be present to discuss it. I fully acknowledge the concerns that have been raised. We have all received visits to our constituency offices from farmers in recent weeks. I am aware that the Dairygold Co-op in my area is planning to import hay from the UK in order to try to alleviate the shortage. We are very conscious of the situation in which farmers, particularly those who live in more disadvantaged areas, find themselves at present. The Minister has asked me to convey his acute awareness of the difficulties being experienced by some farmers as a result of recent unseasonable weather. The difficult conditions which obtained on farms last summer have been compounded by the extended winter. We acknowledge that the harsh weather of recent weeks has led to delayed grass growth and to increased demand for fodder and feed. Animals which, in normal conditions, would be on grass at this time of year have had to be kept indoors. While it is important to record that the outlook for our livestock sectors remains positive and that prices are relatively strong, it is clear that the conditions prevailing at present have resulted in short—term but significant management challenges. These include cashflow and credit issues - to which the Members opposite referred - for affected farmers who are faced with the burden of fodder shortages and additional feed costs. In the context of the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, the Minister urges farmers to contact their local Teagasc advisers. Where winter fodder is limited, Teagasc is providing specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this spring. Staff at all Teagasc offices are available to provide advice to farmers over the phone. Agricultural advisers are equipped and ready to outline the options open to farmers facing difficulties and to make plans which best suit their situations. Teagasc has also made extensive use of national and local media to provide farmers with advice and has co-ordinated with farm organisations, marts, local authorities, co-ops and other suppliers to provide targeted advice to all who need it. Advice for farmers on coping with fodder shortages has also been published, including guidelines to dairy and drystock farmers with little or no grass on feeding this spring. The Minister takes this opportunity to thank Teagasc for its efforts to date and asks that these be intensified in the coming days until the problems being experienced are alleviated by grass growth. The Minister also notes that farm bodies have urged farmers to assess whether they have surplus fodder in stock and whether they are in a position to make some available to others in difficulty. These efforts are to be commended and the Minister echoes the call for those in need of assistance to be supported and urges people who have fodder to spare to be proactive in making it available to neighbouring farmers who are encountering severe problems. This is an occasion when solidarity is needed among the farming community. It is also the case that farmers have increased the usage of concentrates to fill the fodder gap. While addressing the fodder issue, in some cases this has resulted in problems with cashflow and access to working capital on farms. In response to farmers' concerns in this regard, the Minister has already written to the banks and will meet them shortly to highlight the extreme challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather. At that point, he will urge them to take a flexible approach to dealing with short-term credit issues. He will also write to the grain and feed merchants to urge them to be flexible during this difficult period. It is important that financial institutions take into consideration the fact that while the current difficulties may cause cashflow pressures for farmers, the overall outlook for the sector is favourable. Commodity prices are very strong and the positive expectations for dairy, beef and lamb prices mean that farmers should see improved market return for their produce this year. The Minister would also ask that co-ops and others operating in the agrifood sector be sensitive to the particular difficulties being experienced by farmer suppliers this spring. The Minister recently announced an extension, to 15 May 2013, for the closing off of the traditional hay meadow measure in the agri-environment options scheme. He has allowed a deferral of one month to the closing-off date and this will help to maximise grass utilisation in the critical recovery period as the weather improves and grass growth resumes. There is no doubt that the availability of forage on farms presents an ongoing challenge. The Minister has great confidence, however, in the resilience and ingenuity of the Irish farming community. The improvement in soil temperatures during the past week is very welcome and should see a return to more normal growth rates for grass and crops alike. This, together with relatively positive market conditions, should see a significant improvement in the situation in the coming weeks.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:30:00+01:00	I take the Acting Chairman's point, but my understanding is that, with due respect to the Chair, three speakers indicated under the rules of the House and four speakers were granted time. If it is my fault that the time allocation has been impacted upon, I apologise and stand corrected.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:30:00+01:00	No Deputy does not acknowledge the problems facing farmers, particularly those in rural and disadvantaged areas. Some of the prescribed solutions border on blind rhetoric. Fair enough, as that is part and parcel of what we are about in the House. However, that a former Cabinet Minister claims that €10 million should be made available from administration and other sources within the Department leads me to the conclusion that-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:30:00+01:00	-----it should be taken from other schemes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:30:00+01:00	If that is the case, the Deputy should prescribe from which schemes and farmers the money would be taken.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:30:00+01:00	This is a difficult situation. Some reasonable interventions were made about the potential development of a hardship fund. In that sense, I will convey the Deputies' concerns to the Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:40:00+01:00	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I have a technical response on children ingesting detergent "liquitabs" and I will outline it with your indulgence, Acting Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:40:00+01:00	Okay. I take the point. I understand that the National Poisons Information Centre was in contact with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, as the competent authority for detergent regulations last August to September, as it was concerned about the number of incidents reported - as highlighted by the Deputy - involving children and liquid detergent tablets. More than 50% of the inquiries to the poison centre's helpline related to incidents with "liquitabs" involving children, with the majority being between one to three years old. These products are small, with a soft texture which means they are easy for children to pick up and squeeze or put into their mouths. I am stating the obvious. The National Poisons Information Centre was also aware of a report in the media in 2012 from Scotland, reporting five children, all under the age of two, who were admitted to hospital over an 18 month period as emergencies with stridor - or an abnormal breathing sound indicative of a blockage in the throat - and drooling after biting into a liquid detergent capsule. As a result of that and information from the UK, treatment guidelines now advise that "children aged under five years who are asymptomatic but have been exposed to this product within the last two hours should be referred for medical assessment". Therefore, it is essential that parents and guardians contact the National Poisons Information Centre for advice if their child ingests a "liquitab". In response, the HSA met with the National Poisons Information Centre and with the manufacturing companies who are placing these products on the Irish market to discuss the issues arising. The HSA also brought the matter to the attention of the EU Commission and colleague EU member states. In response to its engagement with industry on the issue, all of those companies that place the products on the market in Ireland signed up to the voluntary product stewardship programme in December 2012, which involves commitments to change the packaging to reduce the visibility of the capsules and to restrict access to the capsules by small children. The programme also covers product information and communications about keeping these products out of the reach of children, as well as an awareness campaign designed to keep such products - along with household chemicals - out of the reach of children. The campaign is being prepared by the National Poisons Information Centre with the engagement of industry. All product packaging changes should be in place by June 2013. The HSA and the National Poisons Information Centre continue to monitor and review the progress of the product stewardship plan on an ongoing basis. As recently as last month, the HSA met with the IBEC industry representatives and was updated on proposals in hand with the National Poisons Information Centre concerning awareness plans for the products, along with progress on changes to product packaging. Last November, the HSA formally raised the matter at EU level. In particular, the HSA sought to explore the possibility of taking action under the EU detergents regulation or the EU dangerous preparations directive as a means of addressing the current issue. The EU Commission's considered view was that if EU measures were considered necessary, the provisions of the general product safety directive could be used for immediate action and for long-term measures and what is known as a "restriction" proposal under the EU REACH regulation could be examined. The Commission has indicated, however, that while further discussion would be required with member states to determine the most appropriate measure, it would prefer to await the outcome of the voluntary action being undertaken by industry. I am close to the end of the response. AISE - the EU industry representative organisation for the sector - explained that the capsules have been developed to meet "sustainability" challenges and consumer requests for "easy to use" detergents. One might say that could be deemed as a typical industry response. It also outlined the actions already put in place or ongoing by practically all individual companies concerned and presented proposals for further future actions, including specific labelling and warning icons on the packaging and awareness raising campaigns. I have a few more points to make but in recognition of the amount of time available I will conclude now and respond following Deputy Conway's supplementary questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-04-16T17:40:00+01:00	Again, I fully acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. It is fair to say – I speak objectively – that the HSA is quite fastidious in terms of how it approaches matters such as this one. The Government is happy to allow the HSA to continue to work with the National Poisons Information Centre to monitor and review progress on the voluntary product stewardship programme. If further measures are necessary there is potential for the backup of potential REACH-type legislation at EU level on the matter. I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-04-16T19:20:00+01:00	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I will briefly outline the principal objectives of the Bill. The primary changes extend the remit of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI. Through funding supports via our higher education institutions, SFI will be able to fund applied research as well as continuing to support oriented basic research. This will allow SFI to take the outcome of the research closer to market through increased commercialisation, the development of new products, the generation of new services and technologies and lead to the creation of new sustainable quality jobs for Ireland. I stress that the foundation will continue to support basic research. The legislation will also allow SFI to broaden its programme offerings to cover the 14 priority and six underpinning areas identified by the research prioritisation steering group and approved by Government in March 2012. Importantly, the legislation will also enable the foundation to provide funding on an all-island basis for the first time. Subject to the excellence and strategic criteria being met, SFI will therefore be able to fund researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland. It will also allow the foundation to enter, subject to the consent of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, collaborative arrangements with international partners and help Ireland leverage significant non-Exchequer research funding into the country. In doing so, it will also enable Ireland to support the wider EU research agenda through programmes being supported under the EU's Horizon 2020 strategy, which will have approximately €70 billion available in research funding from 2014 onwards. As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I am eager that Ireland should aggressively target Horizon 2020 funding and the extended SFI legislation should enhance our success rate. The Bill also provides a legislative basis for SFI to stimulate the study and awareness of the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In addition, it includes a number of ancillary provisions that are not specific to SFI, but which relate to Enterprise Ireland, El, IDA Ireland and enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone; amendment of the Freedom of Information Acts specific to our enterprise agencies; and strengthening Forfás's function to provide research data so as to fall in line with international best practice. I shall comment further on these later but I will first give a brief overview of the recent progression of our research and innovation system, of SFI and its role and of the rationale for the changes proposed in the Bill. This legislation affords us an ideal opportunity to remind ourselves of the reasons governments around the world fund research and development. It is universally accepted that the private sector does not fund research and development at the optimum level for economic and societal benefit. There are many reasons for this but primary among them is the inherent risk and uncertainty of such investment. The commercial return from research and development investment, particularly in basic research, is often insufficiently clear-cut for the private investor. Another likely factor is that the direct returns to the private research and development investor are often eclipsed by the societal returns. Considering research in an Irish context, I do not subscribe to the argument that Ireland, as a small open economy, can simply avoid significant investment in research and development, particularly basic research, and simultaneously take advantage of and benefit from discoveries made elsewhere. Discovery, and the benefits it brings, do not exist in a vacuum. If Ireland is to absorb externally generated new knowledge and take advantage of it, we must have the capability to understand and use this new knowledge. The best way of ensuring we can create new knowledge is to conduct excellent and relevant research and development ourselves. Ireland needs to be a "knowledge generator" if further creators of knowledge are to be enticed to the country. A constantly developing and changing global economy and society require Ireland to keep pace if our position in the international marketplace is to be maintained and enhanced. We must continue to invest appropriately in creating and innovating to ensure we can successfully compete in global terms. These are just some of the reasons the Government needs to encourage and supplement private investment in research and development. In Ireland, there has been significant public investment in science, technology and innovation since the late 1990s - primarily to address a number of critical deficits. Following decades of under investment in research and development we lagged well behind our competitors. Our research capabilities then were well below the OECD norm. We lacked a core of talented, high quality research personnel, performing industrially relevant research. This combination of factors impeded our ability to attract and maintain large scale, knowledge intensive industrial projects to Ireland while we were simultaneously failing to develop indigenous, internationally competitive, high growth firms. Our industrial policy in the latter part of the 1990s, therefore, came to be based on the conclusion that we needed to move up the employment value chain by generating our own research talent pool to create the jobs of the future and diversify from low cost, low end manufacturing. In this context, in 1998, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation undertook a technology foresight exercise, which sought to identify emerging areas that would be the key to our economic development and enhanced competitiveness. The resulting foresight report recommended that Government should establish a fund to enable Ireland to become a centre for world-class research excellence in a small number of niche areas. Subsequently, SFI commenced operations in 2000, and was formally established through legislation in 2003. SFI's mission was to support research excellence in the strategically important areas of information communications technology and biotechnology. In 2008, a third research pillar - sustainable energy-energy efficient technologies - was added. A core aspect of what SFI does is the development of a talent pool of Irish-based scientists who, through honing their significant scientific skills here, help to develop the good jobs of the future for Ireland. Significantly, SFI does not provide research grants to industry. That is done through other State research and development supporting agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and so on. The foundation provides grants to researchers and research groups based in our higher education institutions, on the basis of competitive calls for research proposals. It uses a rigorous international peer review process to ensure that only the best proposals receive support - typically 15%-20% of all applications, which is in line with international norms. The foundation's annual grants budget, which is in the region of €150 million, directly supports a cohort of 3,000 researchers in our universities and institutes of technology. These SFI funded researchers are connected to close to 650 distinct companies that employ more than 90,000 people in Ireland. The researchers also leverage significant research funding from non-Exchequer sources, such as the EU and industry - usually between €80 million and €90 million per annum.
