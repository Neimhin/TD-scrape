[<p eid="para_236">I happen to be from Cork. I might have a different view to Deputy McAuliffe on the amount of content that people in the regions perceive that is attributed to Dublin.</p>, <p eid="para_237"> I will begin by saying "well done" to RTÉ on its latest partnership with Virgin Media Television in respect of the Six Nations Championship. That is a wonderful example of collaboration. Speaking as a proud Munster man and a Munster rugby supporter, I also commend RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector on the provision of United Rugby Championship, URC, output. I strongly believe that model has provided excellent content for the average punter sitting at home who wants to view rugby or sporting output at the highest level through the terrestrial channels. The URC is a great example of where the licence payer sees the best of the utilisation of that fund. Are there plans to expand that further? Can we expect to see more of that? Does the director general perceive that RTÉ will do more collaborations of that nature and exploit further opportunities so that more and more people can enjoy - because that is what it is about - the output that is coming through collaborations of that nature?</p>]
[<p eid="para_240">Is there anything in the pipeline at present that Ms Forbes can tell us about in respect of that collaborative model? She spoke about the diversification of sport and, specifically, gender, which is absolutely vital, but what is in pipeline that will embed that model further? From the ordinary punter's point of view, and I am an ordinary punter in this regard, when I look at the URC coverage I see the best of RTÉ, TG4 and the independent sector collaborating.</p>, <p eid="para_241"> Looking at the <i>Irish Examiner</i> model of delivering sport at the most local level through a streaming package, I can tune in to my local team at a county final from the comfort of my living room. Should we go down to that level of granularity? Should the national broadcaster be getting on that wagon to see where the opportunities lie to further embed itself into that collaborative model so that there is more output and RTÉ is taking feeds from a more diverse range of venues across a more diverse range of sports? The technology allows us to do that now. Presumably, RTÉ does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that. I would love to see more of that from our national broadcaster: more localised, more regionalised and more diverse output. If Ms Forbes can tell me it is now part of a policy in RTÉ to continue with that, it will give many people a lot of confidence.</p>]
[<p eid="para_243">I thank Ms Forbes. I will move on to the independent sector. My understanding is that there is a statutory requirement for RTÉ to spend in respect of it. For instance, in 2020, the statutory requirement was to spend approximately €40.2 million - Ms Forbes might correct me if that is wrong. My understanding is that RTÉ spent approximately €36.5 million, which is about €3.7 million under target. I understand that the Covid pandemic was a deciding factor in that because of cancelled productions and so on, but the underspend is then required to be spent within two years. Will Ms Forbes elaborate, or educate us, on how RTÉ plans to spend that underspend? Again, I speak specifically for the independent sector, which is starved of funding at present, has plans afoot to deliver content and is anxious to get going again.</p>]
[<p eid="para_245">What words of assurance can Ms Forbes give us that that will be spent? What plans are afoot in that regard?</p>]
[<p eid="para_421">I ask the witnesses to please forgive me if they have answered a question on this matter before but I had to attend another meeting. I seek assurances on the future of the Cork radio and television studies. Can Ms Forbes give us a guarantee that there is a sustainable future for Cork specifically?</p>]
[<p eid="para_424">I thank Ms Forbes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_487">If I may, Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_489">I lost track momentarily. Is the Chairman on No. 977-PAC 33 or has the Chairman moved on?</p>]
[<p eid="para_491">Can I speak to No. 978B?</p>]
[<p eid="para_493">I am a little bit concerned. I welcome and acknowledge the fact that the Department has corresponded with us in respect of An Taisce.</p>, <p eid="para_494">However, I am a little confused about questions Nos. 3 and 4, specifically the reply to question No. 4, which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_495">On 5th August 2021, An Taisce responded to the Department's letter noting the concerns expressed therein and confirming that they are "fully in compliance with the DPER circular 13/2014." </p>, <p eid="para_496"> That still does not answer the question about the issue of restricted funds and whether or not the Department is fully satisfied that there should have been, within the final accounts, specific reference to Circular 13/2014 and those same restricted funds. I am wondering if, with the agreement of my colleagues and the Chairman, we can ask the Department for further clarification on questions Nos. 3 and 4 and whether there is an obligation for specific reference to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014. We should ask how the Department has asked questions and satisfied itself that An Taisce is fully compliant with that circular. It seems that the Department has merely said it accepts the response from An Taisce. That is my interpretation and I am open to correction on that and to guidance from the Chairman. I would like to interrogate that further to satisfy my mind.</p>]
[<p eid="para_498">Can we work on a response to this correspondence from the Secretary General asking for a further articulation of Circular 13/2014 and what happened when the Department was engaging with An Taisce in respect of that circular? The Secretary General stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_499">there are robust arrangements in place to monitor funding from the Department to An Taisce and to ensure that such funding is in compliance with the conditions of Circular 13/2014. This includes service level agreements, ongoing engagement, reporting and vouched expenditure.</p>, <p eid="para_500">I am still not satisfied that the 2019 accounts were as they should have been. If the Secretary General comes back to us and states the Department is absolutely satisfied it has done everything, then fair enough, but I would like to pursue the issue a little further, if I may.</p>]
