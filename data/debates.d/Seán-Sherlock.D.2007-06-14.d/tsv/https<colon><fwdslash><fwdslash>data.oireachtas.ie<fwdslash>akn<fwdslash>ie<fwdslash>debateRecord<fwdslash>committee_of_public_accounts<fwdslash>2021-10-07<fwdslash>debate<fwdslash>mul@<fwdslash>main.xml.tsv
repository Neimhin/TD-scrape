SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-07T14:00:00+01:00	When the Chair says that we must keep those in our programme, are we proposing to bring An Garda Síochána and the Prison Service before the committee? Are we proposing to bring representatives from the Department of Social Protection before the committee?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-07T14:00:00+01:00	What about the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-07T14:10:00+01:00	I thank the Chairman for facilitating me in this. I am very grateful. I wanted to understand better the relationship between An Taisce and various Departments and statutory funding bodies. We all understand, possibly on a superficial level, the work An Taisce does in respect of education. It is inherently good work, particularly when it comes to blue flag and green schools initiatives. It would be very useful for us to understand the financial relationship. We can bear in mind that between 2018 and 2019, there was a restatement of figures. I wish to understand that better and how the Department has dealt with that matter. I also would like to get an overview of the relationship that exists, including whether there are service level agreements in place. If there are, how do they operate? Do the line Departments that are funders, particularly in the context of restricted funds, have an expectation about the governance of any organisation that they may fund, even if it is a charitable organisation? I am seeking the support of the committee for us to write to the line Departments with a view to getting further information in order to better inform ourselves.
