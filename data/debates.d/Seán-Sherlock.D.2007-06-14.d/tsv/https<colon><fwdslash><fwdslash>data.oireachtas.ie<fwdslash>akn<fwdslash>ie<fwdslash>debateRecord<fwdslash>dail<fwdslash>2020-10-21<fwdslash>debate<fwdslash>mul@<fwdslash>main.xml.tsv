SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-10-21T11:00:00+01:00	It is very seamless between ourselves and the Social Democrats. We work nicely together. I welcome and support the motion. The Grant Thornton report is actually a good report and well worth reading. I am glad it was commissioned. I am particularly impressed with the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis element of it. The report refers to the strengths of the post office with its premium brand recognition and positive public perception, being at the heart of the community, supporting local economic growth and social vibrancy in those communities, a proven track record of service delivery, a loyal customer base, being community and social centred, having the capacity to handle additional business, as well as being Ireland's largest retail network with an unrivalled geographical reach and local knowledge of the network. The weaknesses are the structural decline in letter post volumes, growing digitalisation and e-substitution, dependence on social welfare contracts, increased competition and the failure to grow profitable service lines, and uncommercial post office branches. It is a report which looks inward and is honest about what the post office's failings and weaknesses are. The opportunities are a key element of the SWOT analysis. They include assuming responsibility for additional Government services - "the State on your doorstep"- capability and infrastructure, the ability to extend business, available capacity to grow service offerings for public and private sector organisations, opening up the financial services market, e-commerce and parcel growth, capture new customers and increase market share through to provision of complementary services and products.I could go through the threats but they have been well itemised. The executive summary of the report states "[t]he Post Office Network consisting of 899 post offices, as operated by independent contractors serving local communities across Ireland, faces significant levels of unrestrained closures by the end of 2021 without urgent Government intervention". That is the key sentence. Year in, year out we all stand up in the Dáil and speak about the importance of postal service provision in this country. We hear platitudes spoken on the issue. At the end of the day, as the report highlights, the cost of operating the post office network is €70 million. The revenue generated by the retail element associated with postmasters is €53 million. Therefore, the funding shortfall which must be made good to prevent unrestrained closures of post offices is €17 million.  What can the Government do to bridge that gap? As I have already noted, the report is very good at identifying the network's strengths. How can we build the business base and expand the business model to give post offices a fighting chance, whether they are located in a rural setting or a city like Cork, Galway or Limerick? Post offices everywhere face the same types of challenges. It is important that as consumers we make the conscious decision to use post offices. The volume of customers is an issue. The demise of letter-writing has obviously had a knock-on effect. One could argue that the growth of the parcel service will be relatively short-lived because companies like Amazon are building their own parallel networks. I wonder about the medium-term or long-term sustainability of that contract with An Post. I have my doubts about whether it will turn out to be a profit centre for An Post after all. We need to move beyond platitudes. This is a very good report. The Government must examine and interrogate it further with an ethic of ensuring that post offices are planted firmly and sustainably in communities. There is a template in this report. If it is given a fighting chance, the imbalance in those figures can be addressed.  One of the proposals involves a public service obligation. This should be seriously considered by the Government. As the report highlights, it is already in place. This is an excellent report because it is written for politicians like ourselves, who probably do not have time to go through reports of this nature line by line. The executive summary provides a very good synopsis of what is needed. Countries with approval from the European Commission to operate a post office network through a PSO include France, Italy, Germany, Poland, Finland, Spain and the recently departed but still significant United Kingdom. We do not have one but I think it should be considered. Interestingly, the report also highlights that other industries that previously operated under a PSO in Ireland include agriculture, aviation, rail, finance, bus transport, radio, housing and energy. That is particularly significant. As politicians we are all given to the odd platitude. If we can move beyond rhetoric, embrace the report and think differently about what a PSO can look like, we will have an opportunity to build a sustainable future for the post office network. We will support the motion on that basis.  We cannot look at post offices in a rural setting without looking at the whole area of rural development. It is a tangential point, but it is worth highlighting the report of the Irish Local Development Network on budget 2021. The report outlined three core concerns, namely, that no funding has been provided for new Leader projects in 2021; no funding has been identified for the delivery and administration of the Leader programme in 2021; and no interim national rural development programme has been announced for the period from 2021 to 2023, as committed to in the programme for Government. One might say this has nothing to do with post offices. However, post offices have everything to do with the rural economy, how money can be spent to sustain it and the multiplier effect of money flowing into it. We need to be more expansive in our thinking about the rural economy and rural society. The post office network must be the fulcrum through which rural society survives and thrives.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-10-21T15:40:00+01:00	I support this Bill. We welcome it. I wish to take the opportunity to remember the Buttevant rail disaster that occurred on 1 August 1980, those who were injured in it and the 18 who died. This is pertinent to this legislation because the response to the disaster by the community, emergency services and Iarnród Éireann, or CIÉ at the time, was absolutely tremendous. The event still haunts the community of Buttevant and the wider area. It is appropriate that we are discussing legislation on railway safety and the reporting and investigation of serious accidents and incidents on certain railways. I pay tribute to everybody involved in the response to the disaster, which left so many people scarred. It is still remembered today. I pay tribute to the workers in Irish Rail. I am a weekly user of rail services from Cork to Dublin and also a weekly DART user. At this time of Covid, I pay tribute to those who operate the railway service for us in very difficult circumstances. When I depart Mallow on a Tuesday morning, there is always great banter on the platform with the workers. They are always jovial and full of good humour. The same applies to the staff on the trains. They bring professionalism and friendliness to dealing with customers such as me in their daily work. We should remember this as something that is positive and contributes to society. What underpins it is the ethos of safety on the railway system. I welcome this Bill. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, for her deliberations and introducing legislation that codifies and tidies up elements of railway safety in respect of investigations into serious accidents and incidents.It is important that we have this legislation. I again pay tribute to everybody who was involved in the response 40 years ago to the Buttevant rail disaster. The people within the community and those who professionally responded to that disaster still carry the memories of that fateful day with them. It is important that we acknowledge their memories and also acknowledge the people who were injured and still bear the scars of that disaster.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-10-21T17:20:00+01:00	It is very difficult to countenance supporting the Government on the Bill in its current form. I would characterise its passage as one of sowing additional confusion and obfuscation and having the effect of traumatising further the many women who look to the House and expect us to legislate on the basis of reason. The manner in which the Bill was brought before the Seanad and now this House leaves one utterly disappointed because the subject matter is so sensitive that the least we would have expected, and that the women would have expected, is that we would give it proper and due consideration and time to reflect on all the issues in order that we could all move with one voice. The effect of the Government's stance, position and approach to the Bill will be to divide the House. A minority of us will vote against the Bill, as it is currently constituted, while the majority will vote for it. I expect that many on the Government benches will privately agree with the positions we are adopting, because we do so on the basis of reason and, one hopes, intelligence, but will still walk through the lobbies and vote Tá with the Government. I understand that happens even at the best of times, because I followed the Whip many a time when I was in government, but on an issue such as this, there has to be time and consideration. I wrote to the Ceann Comhairle earlier to express my disappointment at the way in which certain Bills are being dealt with and to see whether we could find some mechanism to ensure that a Bill as sensitive as this would find a better way of progressing through both Houses in order that we could interrogate further what the Minister proposes. The Minister, in his contribution, stuck rigidly to the 30 October deadline.I have been confused by this and perhaps the Minister will give us the benefit of his wisdom but it is my simple understanding that there is nothing injurious to the Constitution such that the Minister could not provide for an extension of time for the passage of this legislation or even an extension of time for the commission. Is it overly simplistic of me to put forward the argument that there is nothing that says we as a legislature could not amend the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 to make provision for the very sensitive issues that are inherent within this Bill and for which the Minister is arguing he cannot move beyond the 30 October deadline? That is the first point I will make and it is one on which I would love to receive an answer when the Minister is responding to this debate. The second issue is that the Minister sent us a note by his adviser or staff earlier in which he says:Finally, with regard to the unfortunate urgency of this legislation, the Commission is due to submit its final report and stand dissolved in law by 30th October. At present, that timeframe can only be amended where the Minister receives a request for an extension from the Commission which is grounded in an interim report. This request then has to be considered and approved by Government. To date, no request for an extension has been received. As such, if this legislation is not enacted by 30th October, then we will have failed to preserve the unique database developed by the Commission and provide for its use in line with data protection and other existing law.Forgive my blinding ignorance and I seek the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister on this but I would have thought, having served in government, that there are lines of communication between the commission and the Government such that, if the Minister's argument is that he has not received the request and therefore has to adhere to the law, there is some mechanism that could be found to allow for us to give further consideration to this and some formal or informal line of communication can be established such that the Minister stands up in the House and says he would like more time to deliberate and that he would like an extension beyond 30 October. How can we develop a mechanism or a protocol to be able to do that? I am sure something could be found to do that and to facilitate both Houses of the Oireachtas to be able to give more time to the passage of this legislation. Will the Minister please respond to that question because it is not just about me? More importantly, it is about the people outside of these walls who are looking to us, who have written to us, who are traumatised and hurt, who want to ensure that whatever happens in here happens in a way that is sensitive to their needs. Right now, the way they feel is that they are being traumatised again and we need to address that as a legislature. If some mechanism can be found to find an extension then it should be found. I think it can be found and that it can be done easily. The third point I will make is in respect of the Minister's speech where he says:I intend to request the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration to lead on this re-examination in a format that would allow for survivors and their representatives, expert legal opinion and other leading academics to explore thoroughly the major principles underlying the debate on access to personal information in the commission's archive and to make a set of recommendations aiming to resolve the very real difficulties which the passage of this legislation has highlighted.  I am a member of that committee and my interpretation of that statement is that the Minister is asking me, as a member of that committee, to do the work the Minister should be doing as a Minister regarding the process of pre-legislative scrutiny and giving more time to deliberation of these issues such as the balance of rights between seeking information and of personal privacy and the issue of agency. These issues should all be sorted before we come to the House to legislate, not after the fact, because Deputy Funchion, who made an astounding contribution to this debate earlier on, is chair of that committee and there is now an expectation being foisted on the committee that we would deal with and deliberate on these and come up with a set of recommendations. Given the history of that committee under a previous mandate and not under the chairmanship of Deputy Funchion we have made umpteen recommendations through umpteen reports, as have many Oireachtas committees, which are gathering dust on shelves. It insults my intelligence for the Minister to bring that before me as a Member of this Oireachtas when there is a mechanism and that is pre-legislative scrutiny, which was waived in this instance, and proper consideration in committee of all of these issues so that we can legislate properly, there is no request afterwards and we do not legislate in haste such that we are correcting errors after the fact. It has permutations for how we do our business but it is an insult to the people who have been traumatized. It is insulting to them to bring legislation in this way. This should be non-partisan and it should be dealt with in a way that ensures it progresses and every Member of this House agrees on it.
