[<p eid="para_379">It is not too often I am first to speak at Question Time.  Does the Minister acknowledge that this will place a further cost on the primary producer given the cost per tag is estimated at between €2 and €2.50?  Farm organisations are suggesting this will place a burden of up to €30 million on primary producers.  Does the Minister acknowledge that the current traceability regime is adequate and that it is ludicrous that any European Union proposal would seek to electronically tag any animal for the purpose of meeting some bureaucratic designation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_383">Is the assumption of €1 million industry-wide or is it divided by 30,000 sheep farmers?  Is that the basis of the Minister's claim?  Did the European Commission put forward this proposal in 2003 or did it come directly from a Council of Ministers initiative?  I would like to know the Council's stated reason for refusing the derogation on the Irish position.</p>]
[<p eid="para_467">The Minister's response is utterly disingenuous.  Would he not acknowledge the fact that justice has not been served for the Byrne family, who had no way of knowing the terms of the scheme and no way of benefiting by way of tonnage under the scheme for the reasons outlined by the Ombudsman?  She found that the advertising process was utterly inadequate and the family had no way of benefiting from the scheme as a result.  Would the Minister acknowledge that her decision to grant compensation was based on her acknowledgement of the wrong that was done and that there was no way the family could benefit from tonnage?</p>, <p eid="para_468">The Ombudsman found that some prospective applicants were put in a more advantageous position than others as they were written to by the Department and the Minister to inform them of the scheme when it was launched.  The Minister must respond on this matter.  Third, the very fact that the Ombudsman deemed it necessary to place the report before the House must be significant.  The Government side of the House is disregarding and disrespecting the decision of the Ombudsman and the Minister must answer for that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_475">To suggest it was incumbent on every applicant to read the fishing press is a disgrace.  In this situation, a father had passed away as well as three crew and a brother.  Does the Minister think their extended family would be reading the fishing press?  What we are seeking here is natural justice.  This is borne out by the fact that the Ombudsman, an independent arbiter, has made a ruling in the case.  On this basis, we are seeking to press the Department for a change of heart so this family can benefit from natural justice, as well as other people who might be adversely affected by this scheme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_482">Certain people got a heads-up from sources about the scheme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_524">Deputy Cuffe asked a question on the possibility of establishing a code of practice or ombudsman.  The second proposal is the wrong approach.  Does the Minister of State agree that a code of practice would not be worth the paper it was written on until such time as a legislative mechanism is put in place to ensure primary producers of animals and vegetables are given a fair crack of the whip in terms of securing a fair percentage of the market price for their products?</p>, <p eid="para_525">The Minister of State indicated that 200 producers enjoyed a share of the €8 million provided in grant aid.  Will he provide a breakdown of the figure?  Do potato growers feature among this coterie of beneficiaries?</p>]
[<p eid="para_532">Is Deputy Cuffe satisfied with the Minister of State's response?</p>]
[<p eid="para_604">Does the Minister acknowledge that some of the problems encountered by the pig and food industries are due partly to the fact that legislation on packaging has not been amended and that the issue of substantial transformation still impacts on the comparative advantage Irish producers might enjoy if the issue were to be sorted out?</p>]
[<p eid="para_615">In that review I ask the Minister of State to recognise that €1,450 is too modest a grant sum because the input cost is high enough for individual farmers who might wish to move into growing miscanthus.  If the sum were to be increased it would encourage more growers.</p>, <p eid="para_616">There is no doubt about the potential of miscanthus especially for the manufacture of pellets and firelogs, as the Minister of State outlined.  Demand is growing exponentially and on an almost weekly basis.  The delay does not relate to miscanthus being brought to market but rather it revolves around trying to encourage more farmers to grow it.  The only way to achieve the latter is to provide a greater incentive at the start-up point.  I, therefore, ask that the Minister of State consider increasing the start-up grant.</p>]
[<p eid="para_625">I accept that a marketing exercise will have to be undertaken.  However, a great deal of micromarketing is taking place in various regions — Limerick and east Cork are two examples of which I am aware — in respect of certain sectors.  Those involved in the industry have informed me that if the start-up grant paid to farmers is increased, and if a proper education process to accompany this is put in place, this will be of major assistance to local or micromarketing initiatives.</p>, <p eid="para_626">With respect, we should not discuss this matter in an aspirational way.  Let us put our money where our mouth is and invest in the industry.  Miscanthus is both a carbon offset plant and a fuel source and it offers massive potential.  We should display a great deal more urgency in the context of how we promote the growing of this plant.</p>]
