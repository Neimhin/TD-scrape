SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is hard not to disagree with what is contained in the document in terms of the aspirations of the IFA in relation to CAP, namely, supporting family farms, maintaining and supporting the production base, sustainable grass based production, response to demands of consumers, EU equivalence on food safety and climate change goals.  It is not often I or this committee would disagree with the IFA.  There is a sense that the future of agriculture and this economy is predicated on a strong agricultural base and that this will form the basis of the recovery we need.I am at variance with the IFA's position in relation to the preservation of the historical model.  I do not believe the historical model as the IFA sees it will be preserved.  I do not believe there exists the political will within the European Union group of member states to preserve the historical model as espoused here.  I wonder if the political realities are such that the historical model will not be preserved and if this is the IFA's negotiating position at this juncture — it is still early days.  What will be the IFA's fall-back position in the event that there is no political support for the preservation of the historical model?The Labour Party agrees that we must try to preserve the envelope.  Of that, there is no question.  Perhaps Mr. Bryan will clarify the following for me.  I do not understand how the IFA can on the one hand preserve the historical model and at the same time encourage the entry of new farmers into the sector.  I believe there is an imbalance in this regard.  CAP needs to be structured in a way that pertains to Ireland and in such a manner that ensures those farmers who innovate and continue to push out the boundaries to grow their enterprises are rewarded.  Such people are in the main the younger generation of farmers who entered into the sector in recent years.  I do not wish to be at variance with the IFA but I am trying to open up a debate on whether it is realistic to assume the historical model as we know it which we would like to see preserved if the political winds are blowing against it.The Minister, when addressing the Seanad, appeared to suggest that preserving that model of payments will be an uphill battle for the Irish Government.  I am interested to hear the IFA's response.  I stated at the last meeting of this committee attended by all the farm representatives that I feared for the way in which modulation might go in that if payments were to be diverted through pillar 2, they might be diverted away from directly benefiting farmers, farm holdings or primary producers, thus falling into the black hole of the Leader groups and other such representative organisations, something which I would be against.  My party would not countenance any situation whereby the farm effort in terms of primary producers would not be directly funded.It is easy for me to proffer an argument that suggests the historical model might be dead.  The question that arises then is what is the alternative.  I believe it is still early days in this regard.  We need a model that ensures innovation is rewarded and there is no income floor below which any farmer or primary producer will fall.  There must be a safety net in place and a floor below which no producer will fall to ensure at least an income.  I do not know whether the IFA goes along with the argument put forward by certain sectors within the farm lobby that we should have a minimum payment for every farmer or a per hectare minimum payment.  However, it is an issue that needs to be examined.  I believe we still have a long way to go and that the Irish members of the European Parliament's agricultural committee will have a major bearing on how this negotiation pans out in the long run.  I am glad to see that because of the Lisbon treaty, this is the case and that it will not be only a single voice, namely, the Minister, who will be negotiating.  The co-decision procedure allows MEPs to have a strong say in how CAP progresses.I would like to hear from the farming organisations what will be the alternative if the historical model is to be abolished because there is no political support for it.  I would like also that we would all buy into that process and would not be behind the curve in relation to Ireland incorporated.
