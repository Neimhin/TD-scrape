[<p eid="para_298">I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to confirm if material, which was removed from slag heaps at Haulbowline, was used in road construction or for other uses; the need for him to indicate the quantity of material removed, whether the material was examined for toxicity and, if necessary, treated; the need for him to indicate the name of the company or companies that extracted the material; the need for him to indicate where the material was used and if the requisite licences were in place; and the need for him to confirm that all potentially hazardous material removed from the site can be accounted for.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1699">In light of the revelations by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, we know materials were moved from this site to the mainland.  The current investigation, therefore, must also examine material carried off site.  We need to know where the material was transported to and how it was transported.  Was a licence granted to transport it?  Was only inert material transported?  Is the material forming part of a slag heap somewhere in County Cork?  Given the material was transported by a company based in Mallow, when did it transfer to Mallow?  Is the material still in Mallow or has it been deposited in municipally licensed dumps in north Cork?  Is material deposited in non-licensed facilities?  Can the Minister confirm whether some material has ended up in other locations in north Cork?   Will the Minister, on foot of these revelations, consider a further investigation and use the powers vested in him to seek to ensure complete traceability of all materials?  Will he widen the remit of the current assessment of the site to ensure all traceable material, both on and off site, comes within the remit of that investigation?  In light of these revelations, I also call on the Minister to meet the elected representatives of east Cork and the harbour area and, in particular, the mayor of Cobh immediately to listen to their concerns.</p>]
