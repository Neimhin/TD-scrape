SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In the light of the publication yesterday of the European Commission's proposals on CAP reform and of the health check and given that this is a legislative proposal to which the Government will be a party and which will have serious permutations for Ireland and bring about significant changes with regard to how the farming community and the rural economy develop, will the Government make time available to debate the matter in the House?  Although no specific legislative proposal is due to come before the House, will the Government, in view of the serious nature and importance of the issue, make arrangements for such a debate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I accept the Taoiseach's point.  The matter will obviously be discussed by the joint committee.  However, in view of its serious nature, it is worthy of a debate in the House.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Wall.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In speaking to this motion one wonders what is the Government's primary motivation in putting it before the House.  It is not a legislative proposal.  It contains no concrete provisions.  It is short on detail and long on aspiration and therein lies the rub.  The Government is high on aspiration but low on delivery.  The motion is so broad that one senses there is a clear agenda by the Government to pay lip service to the idea of addressing the young people's issues throughout this island.  What young people want are concrete legislative proposals that will speak directly to their concerns.  These concerns are well documented and have been brought to Government through representative bodies such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI.  The NYCI is a social partner and the genuineness of this motion will be measured by the Government's response to concerns outlined by groups such as the NYCI.  I fear, however, that this motion is meaningless and full of platitudes and that young people have become used to hearing from a Government about the provision of services.In the limited time afforded to me I wish to address a number of specific areas.  The first relates to the health of children and our young people.  The NYCI, in its budget submission, calls on the Government to deliver on its promise to double the income threshold for full medical card entitlements for parents of children under six years of age in this year's budget.  I believe this is attainable.  The Government must look positively on this proposal.  Approximately 1.1 million children and young people under the age of 18 live in Ireland.  According to the NYCI, only 305,000 of them are covered under the medical card scheme.  Access to a GP is vital to ensure that a young person can avail of services to assist him or her through these difficult years.  A young person needs to be able to do this without incurring a financial cost.  This service would serve as a positive move that would give young people the confidence and independence to avail of vital services but in a way that would ensure confidentiality.  Young people living in rural areas in particular where counselling and other services are not readily available would benefit in particular.  The Government must also look favourably on families with children over the age of seven and under the age of 18 with a view to ensuring that income thresholds are raised to allow more children to avail of primary and secondary health care.The second issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of adequate facilities and services for young people who are in need of counselling and require access to mental health facilities.  In my constituency of Cork East the organisation Lets Get Together was set up to help others affected by suicide and to examine ways of preventing it.  In 2005 the Lets Get Together Foundation linked up with a number of similar organisations throughout the country to set up an all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy, thereby raising awareness of the issue and speaking to local and national media.  If this motion is to mean anything, the Government must assist organisations of this nature.  The highest rate of suicide is found among young men aged under 35 — this age group accounts for 40% of all Irish suicides.  There is a clear lack of a coherent Government policy to encourage young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives to talk to others about it.  The lack of available facts on a range of health and lifestyle issues linking potential users to relevant help services throughout the country is exacerbating the travesty of suicide which has reached epidemic proportions throughout this land.  We have the fifth highest suicide rate in Europe among the 15 to 25 year age group and death by suicide is the number one cause of death among young Irish men.  The Government, if it is serious about this motion, needs to fund more campaigns of representative organisations such as the NYCI, through the primary care strategy, to reduce the large number of deaths by suicide.  Awareness must be raised.  Young people need options and to be able to access them in a safe and non-judgmental manner.  We have all experienced tough times.  Many of us have been fortunate in that we had family and friends to support us.  Not every young person has that luxury.  Issues such as coming out to parents, unexpected pregnancy, low self-esteem and depression need to be tackled in a non-judgmental way.On the issue of unwanted pregnancies, now that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has admitted that VAT on condoms can be cut to as low as 5%, will she not bring a proposal to Cabinet that the Minister for Finance should cut the tax from 21% to 5%, as was done in the UK and other EU member states?  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has stated that 32% of people have indicated that the cost of contraception is a major factor in the decision not to use condoms, resulting in a rising incidence of sexually transmitted disease and unintended pregnancies.  I could go on as there are many issues.  However, since I am sharing with my colleague, Deputy Wall, I am happy to do so and will leave it at that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The Defence Forces camp at Kilworth, County Cork, has been designated as the location for a prison covering Munster and it will replace facilities at Cork Prison in particular.  The proposed location of the prison will be within the 1,200 acre camp located close to the M8 motorway between Mitchelstown and Fermoy and it is destined to house up to 450 prisoners.  On Monday last, the residents of the immediate area called public representatives to a meeting to discuss the proposals and to air their genuine concerns.  In seeking this Adjournment debate, I wish to speak about a number of those concerns.  Given that this prison will be constructed under the terms of the strategic infrastructure legislation, there is genuine concern that local residents' fears will not be addressed.  The construction of such a large prison within a very rural area raises a number of fears.  For example, landowners who leased land from the Department of Defence for agricultural purposes now wonder where their future lies.  They had a long-standing arrangement and have asked will they be able to stay on the land or will this scenario change.People have also asked whether the land acquisition process for the prison has been completed.  If not, there is a strong school of thought within the community that the footprint of the prison should be moved to a more suitable location within the overall landholding.  The community also believe the prison should be constructed within contours that make it more suitable.  It is strongly perceived that the current proposal, as we understand it, is a site within 162 acres.  If the land acquisition is not completed, residents believe that the case could be made for the prison to be moved, even if that is beyond the current 162-acre footprint.From an environmental point of view, there are concerns that three streams within the footprint of the proposal will be compromised.  The area in question is served by the Killally, Ballinrush and Graigue group water scheme.  The source of this scheme is approximate to the footprint of the site.The Minister, in response to a question I tabled on Thursday last, stated that normal planning provisions do not apply to a prison development.  There is an understanding that for security reasons one does not broadcast or make known the exact plans.  We all acknowledge that fact, but further concerns have been raised about the transport provisions to and from the prison.  People in the nearby village of Kilworth, where at times traffic causes a bottleneck, are seeking, through their community council, assurances on the traffic management provisions of the proposals.  They also seek a buffer zone around the prison from an aesthetic and security point of view.Those who live in Cork city are used to the presence of a prison within their city.  The construction of a prison of this nature in a very rural area would give rise to genuine causes for concern and anxiety.If the proposal is being presented as a fait accompli and is not subject to normal planning considerations, I respectfully ask the Minister to ensure any provisions relating to public safety and environmental concerns are addressed.  To assist the community further, I respectfully request of the Minister and his officials that he would meet a deputation of residents and public representatives in the area so they can have their concerns addressed at an early stage.
