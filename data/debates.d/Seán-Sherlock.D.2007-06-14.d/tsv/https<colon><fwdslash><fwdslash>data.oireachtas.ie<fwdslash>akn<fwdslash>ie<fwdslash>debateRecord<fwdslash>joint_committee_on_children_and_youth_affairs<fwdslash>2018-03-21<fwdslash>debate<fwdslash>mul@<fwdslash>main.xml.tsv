SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	I was very impressed by the submission because it gets to the nub of the issue and provides a set of recommendations that are easily digestible for generalists such as ourselves. I welcome the submission that has been provided here today. I tend to ask rapid-fire questions, if I may. The W82GO! team is a multidisciplinary one. How many multidisciplinary teams are in this country? 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Is the W82GO! team the only one?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Why has the team not been replicated throughout the regions? Why must a child who presents in Cork, Kerry or Limerick travel to Temple Street Children's University Hospital in Dublin?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	If I understand what has been said correctly as a layman, is it appropriate that severe cases are referred to the centre of excellence in Temple Street Children's University Hospital? Yes. As a former Minister of State who had responsibility for research, I note the team has clinical leads and I seek to understand both the resourcing and the research element in this regard. The W82GO! multidisciplinary team receives funding from the Temple Street Foundation and the HSE. Have peer-reviewed research papers and outputs been produced? Obviously the research is peer reviewed as Ms Sheridan has nodded her head. I seek an insight into what is happening on the research side. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	The HRB.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	I am happy to hear from other people on this matter. Research is a particular area of interest for me because I know that strong peer-reviewed research leads to successful outcomes. It has been stated that as many as 145,000 children attend the hospital every year and the team has extrapolated a figure of 4,000. Am I correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Yes. Am I correct to say that there were 4,000 attendances in the years 2014 to 2018, inclusive?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	It has also been stated that 49% of patients in 2017 were aged under ten years. Is the unit conducting live research into the types of children who attend in terms of demographics, backgrounds and the psychosocial elements? Does all of that form part of the research? There are short, medium and long-term effects. I note that the unit is part of Growing Up in Ireland, the national longitudinal study of children. Has the research and study had a bearing on the issue? Fundamentally, this committee wants to find ways to stamp out obesity. What tools are needed to tackle the problem? To me, research is one element. Obviously resources are required to be invested in the clinical area. If I have read the situation correctly, there are not enough clinicians working in the sector as it is relatively new. What can we do about that aspect?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	I want to discuss the statement that families with financial challenges are more likely to be prone to obesity and 40% of the children who attend the unit come from seriously deprived backgrounds. How do those facts present themselves? I am open to hearing about this matter from other witnesses too.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Is that element the exception or the norm?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	How can we disrupt that dynamic and improve things? People have called for safe play environments for children.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Ms Sheridan is advocating a common-sense approach.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	As a layperson, I will ask whether the witnesses think the solution is as simple as getting children to become active.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	There is a psychological aspect too.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	I have one last question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:00:00+00:00	I thank the Chairman for his indulgence. Let us say the witnesses were given a magic wand tomorrow that granted them all of the resources they needed. What would the development of an implementation plan and evaluation framework for the provision of services to children and adolescents with clinical obesity throughout Ireland look like in real terms?Would it be a case of staging what Dr. O'Malley is doing and scaling it out to the regions or would it be a question of adding more layers of resources to what she is doing with her team?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00	Can I take it from Dr. O'Malley's request for increased funding that there a shortage of funding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00	Will Dr. O'Malley explain why endocrinology will be needed?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00	How many bariatric procedures have been carried out?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00	Are people losing their lives as a result of not having bariatric procedures?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-21T11:10:00+00:00	Does Dr. O'Malley have figures for the number of people who have died?
