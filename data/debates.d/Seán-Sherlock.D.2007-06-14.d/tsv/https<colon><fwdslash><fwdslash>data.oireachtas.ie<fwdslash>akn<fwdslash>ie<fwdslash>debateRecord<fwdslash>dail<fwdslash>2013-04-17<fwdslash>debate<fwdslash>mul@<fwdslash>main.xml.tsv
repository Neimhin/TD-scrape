[<p eid="para_671">I note the issues raised by the Deputy. The review commenced in October 2010 under the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and such value for money reviews are part and parcel of governance within the State. It is important that we try to ensure as we best we can that the ethos of rural schools is maintained in the context of the positive impact they have on their communities.</p>]
[<p eid="para_674">I again acknowledge the Deputy's concerns in this regard and I reiterate that the report is being finalised. It has, therefore, not been completed and the concerns raised by both Deputies should form part of the policy outcome. However, no final policy decision has been made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_678">It is not right for Deputies to up the rhetoric on this issue when a final decision has not yet been made. In the case of rural schools with only a small number of pupils, it is eminently reasonable and sensible to proceed with amalgamations when they can be achieved through a process of consensus. The annual savings to be achieved are available for everyone to see. The budget measures set out a target of saving 250 posts over a three year period. Deputy McConalogue is a member of the party which instigated the review in question. Let us be honest about how we approach this issue. It is appropriate to have a value for money report on small schools. It is not proposed to compromise the ethos that exists in rural communities. I do not propose to mouth platitudes about representing either a rural or urban community because most Deputies are familiar with the importance of rural schools and their positive impact on local communities. From a policy point of view, the decision must have regard to this fact.</p>]
[<p eid="para_680">The State Examinations Commission, SEC, has statutory responsibility for the certificate examinations. A waiver from spelling and grammar can be provided to candidates with special educational needs under the scheme of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations, RACE. A devolved system is in place for the junior certificate examinations. Schools can recommend the granting of accommodations which are then granted by the State Examinations Commission. However, accommodations which are granted for the junior certificate will not automatically be carried on to the leaving certificate. Instead, all applications for accommodations in the leaving certificate are referred by schools to the National Educational Psychological Service for a decision.</p>, <p eid="para_681"> Applications for the year 2012-13 are not yet complete. In the 2012 leaving certificate examinations, a total of 3,940 candidates applied for a waiver from the spelling and grammar element of language subjects. Of these, 2,587 or 66% were granted and 1,353 or 34% were refused. The State Examinations Commission cannot provide statistics on candidates refused such a waiver at leaving certificate who had a waiver at junior certificate. This information would require a manual examination of each file. Appeals against any State Examinations Commission decisions on RACE can be made to an independent appeals committee.</p>, <p eid="para_682">Statistics for the leaving certificate 2012 on the spelling and grammar waiver</p>, <p eid="para_683">Year</p>, <p eid="para_684">No. of applications for spelling and grammar waiver</p>, <p eid="para_685">Number granted</p>, <p eid="para_686">Number refused</p>, <p eid="para_687">2012</p>, <p eid="para_688">3,940</p>, <p eid="para_689">2,587</p>, <p eid="para_690">1,353</p>]
[<p eid="para_694">Perhaps the Deputy will submit a parliamentary question on the case to which he referred or raise it directly with the Minister to have it examined. In cases where a parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of a decision by the State Examinations Commission, he or she may appeal to an independent appeals committee whose members are drawn from outside the commission. The remit of the appeals committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the State Examinations Commission. Appeals must be lodged in writing and all appeals are considered in light of the framework of principles established by an expert advisory group. The Department and Minister do not have a role in reviewing decisions made by the State Examinations Commission or independent appeals committee in respect of the scheme of reasonable accommodations in the certificate examinations.</p>, <p eid="para_695"> Of the unsuccessful applicants for reasonable accommodations in 2012, 513 made an appeal to the independent appeals committee. Of these appeals, 32 were successful while the original decision made by the commission was upheld in the remaining cases. The Minister is satisfied that the scheme's application and appeal processes operate in an open and transparent manner. Notwithstanding this, I am willing to examine the specific critique of the system made by an eminent and qualified person who has done an assessment of a student. I ask the Deputy to provide me with the details of the case.</p>]
[<p eid="para_698">The Deputy raises an issue in the context of the transition from junior to leaving certificate in terms of one being a devolved system while the other is independent. There seems to be a question regarding the need for further clarification on that transition in the context of how the two-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_700">-----systems operate. The Deputy indicated that he has referred the particular case involved to the Minister, Deputy Quinn. If he could refer it again-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_702">-----I will revert to him on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_704">The national strategy for higher education outlines a range of actions aimed at enhancing teaching and the learning experience of all students. Last November the Minister announced the establishment of the national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning, which will provide a platform for progressing key actions such as the development of innovative pedagogies, better supports for first year students and promoting academic professional development. Listening and responding to feedback from students and other stakeholders is also crucial in ensuring high quality provision. The first national survey of employers was completed in December 2012 and a national student survey is currently being established, a pilot of which is now under way. Measures are also being taken to ensure a robust and effective quality assurance system. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012 established Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which has taken on responsibility for externally reviewing the quality assurance arrangements of universities. Learner involvement will be an important feature of future quality assurance processes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_707">With respect, I hope I understand the Deputy's question. If he is expressing concerns in respect of the focus on teaching, I am not quite clear from where his underlying assumption that there are issues around teaching within the third level sector comes. Perhaps I missed something in that regard. There is a national strategy in respect of teaching in the higher education sector. The national forum for the enhancement of teaching and learning was launched in November 2012 and is chaired by Professor Sarah Moore of the University of Limerick. The national forum will consolidate and build upon the strengths of existing individual institutions and their teaching and learning frameworks. The work of the national forum is under way and I hope this provides an answer to one part of the Deputy's question. The national forum will provide a key system-level infrastructure for the support of the national strategy and serve as a platform for academic-led enhancement of teaching. Its focus will be on adding value by providing a structure through which these institutional and network initiatives can be synergised and leveraged. The nascent forum held its first meeting in March.</p>, <p eid="para_708"> It is important to state that each academic institution has its own degree of autonomy. The Deputy will appreciate the higher education block grant of over €1 billion. I am of the view that the aims behind the national strategy will complement the goal of our making a greater economic impact through the creation of further jobs and enhance people's learning experience. As already stated, in the context of the teaching experience the national forum is examining the development of innovative pedagogies and the technologies which support these. In itself, this is quite innovative. It is also considering whether it might be necessary to broaden students' first year experience or whether prescribed courses should be retained.</p>]
[<p eid="para_710">The straight answer to the Deputy's question on mining data is that such data is already available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_712">I was just about to say that measuring teaching outcomes from either a quantitative or qualitative point of view is quite challenging, particularly in view of the different academic ethos which obtains within the various higher education institutions. One way to try to ensure more efficient outcomes from a teaching point of view is to consider professional academic development and the research which underpins it. The system at post-primary level is highly evolved.</p>, <p eid="para_713">There should also be a system that is promoted at tertiary level. If there is greater academic professional development, there are better teachers, more specialties are created and better outcomes are driven. This issue is being considered as part of the national forum.</p>, <p eid="para_714"> The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I am unsure as to whether we have those data. We can check for him. However, there is a focus on his points regarding the need for metrics and indices.</p>]
[<p eid="para_716">The "Teachers' Voice" is a report based on the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland, ASTI's consultation with teachers on the new framework for junior cycle. It is valuable to have access to these findings, which are being considered within the Department.</p>, <p eid="para_717"> At the ASTI conference, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made a point of commending the ASTI for the content of the report and the process that led to its publication. He has read the report and is listening carefully to the concerns of teachers. The Department has established an education partners consultation group to provide the partners, including the ASTI, with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased implementation of the junior cycle. The group meets every four to six weeks, providing an opportunity to highlight opportunities and challenges. In addition, the ASTI is represented on the key National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, structures responsible for the development of the curriculum, including the council and its substructures.</p>, <p eid="para_718"> Teachers will be provided with a comprehensive continuing professional development, CPD, programme from autumn 2013 that will address many of the concerns highlighted in the ASTI report.</p>]
[<p eid="para_722">The teachers' representative organisations are part of the educational partners consultation group and provide partners, including the ASTI, with a formal medium for assisting in the planning of the phased introduction of the junior cycle. This is proof of their involvement in a consultative process. Meetings are held approximately every month. At these, the partners have an opportunity to highlight their key concerns. In addition, the ASTI is represented on the NCCA's council and subject development groups. At these meetings, the future shape of the curriculum is considered and findings are presented to the Minister.</p>, <p eid="para_723"> I take the point made by the president of the ASTI. It conducted a survey of teachers, the response of whom was clear and has been acknowledged by the Minister, but Mr. Breslin stated that, while it was clear from teachers' responses that some aspects of the Minister's framework had the potential to improve the educational experience of young people in junior cycle, teachers were resoundingly stating that this potential was contingent upon assessment and certification procedures that were fair, transparent and, critically, did not undermine educational standards. There is cross-party agreement on this point, given the fact that the House has passed a motion supporting the junior cycle reforms. The Member opposite voted in favour of those reforms. There is a process of consultation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_725">There is pageantry and choreography to these setpiece events in the Chamber. As an Opposition spokesperson, there is a little jousting and political point scoring. That is fair enough, but every Deputy acknowledges the need for junior cycle reform and wants it to go the right way and to be based on consensus and consultation. There should be proper continuing professional development for teachers if they are to embrace a new way of teaching.</p>, <p eid="para_726"> The assessment aspect will be concerned with improving learning outcomes and not just proving them, if the Deputy knows what I mean. The role of the ASTI and teachers in this will be paramount. It is the most important role. We want to ensure that there is ongoing consultation with teachers and their representative organisations. There is a mechanism to this end as the junior cycle is rolled out. I do not know whether I can elaborate further.</p>]
[<p eid="para_728">As the Deputy will be aware, there are two schools on this site, a junior school and a senior school, both of which have temporary accommodation in addition to their permanent structures and have applied to the Department for replacement permanent buildings. The next step to progressing a building project for the schools involves the appointment of a design team and the commencement of the architectural planning process. School building projects such as this one that are not included in the five-year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of further funds being available to the Department in the future.</p>, <p eid="para_729"> My Department has decided to build a new primary school close to the schools in question in order to meet an identified demographic need in the area. Lucan has been identified as an area in which there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at post-primary and primary levels during the coming years. It is within this context that, in 2011, the Minister announced the future establishment of a new 1,000-pupil second level school and a new 16-classroom primary school. The primary school will open in temporary accommodation in September 2013 under the patronage of County Dublin VEC. It will be a multidenominational, English medium, co-educational primary school. Both primary and post-primary schools will cater for increasing demographic demand in the general Lucan area.</p>]
[<p eid="para_736">The Deputy should make the request.</p>]
[<p eid="para_739">The Deputy should make the request in writing. It is on the record. The Deputy will appreciate that the demographic issue is clear. His situation in Lucan is not untypical of other parts of the country, including my area where there are serious demographic demands. There is a feeling among existing schools that they have been bypassed in favour of the creation of new schools. However, the demographic projection figures do not lie and therefore we face a cliff in certain parts of the country in terms of educational provision and it is necessary to build new schools. Without plámásing, I sympathise with the views expressed by Deputy Keating. If he makes a request to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister will take it from there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_744">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 34, 48 and 59 together.</p>, <p eid="para_745"> The promotion of student well-being and positive mental health strategies in schools is a key aim of my Department. Accordingly, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has directed my Department's support services to review and prioritise support for schools on the guidelines for mental health promotion which he launched recently with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The guidelines bring together existing guidance and programmes to ensure a more integrated and holistic policy approach is taken towards student well-being. The guidelines, which are evidence-based, are an essential reference point for teachers and school management in terms of their planning for the implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan and for accessing the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support framework. Relevant supports for schools are outlined in the document.</p>]
[<p eid="para_749">I accept the point the Deputy is making. Perhaps it is a commentary on life in this country at present for people who are unemployed, employed or in specific professions that the level of stress has increased dramatically. We have had a recession for more than five years at this stage and that takes its toll. Decisions have been made on budgetary issues pertaining to education involving a reduction in services as a result of the macroeconomic situation in which we find ourselves.</p>, <p eid="para_750"> In my experience, teachers as a cohort are very supportive of each other in terms of developing mechanisms for dealing with stress. I have an open mind on the issue. I honestly do not know how the Department can put in place mechanisms that are funded to assist teachers specifically to alleviate stress. I do not know how one would achieve that without achieving it in other areas of the public sector also. There are definite guidelines on students. It is an apolitical space. Through providing guidelines for the promotion of mental health and suicide prevention, the State is doing a lot to ensure the health and well-being of pupils.</p>, <p eid="para_751">The straight answer to the Deputy's question is that I do not know how one would develop a mechanism that is funded specifically for teachers but I have an open mind on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_754">There is common ground here. What has amazed me since becoming Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills two years ago is the well-spring of initiatives in schools and the level of cohesion between teachers and pupils in their collaboration on such projects. We all acknowledge that and I accept the point that we should examine some of these projects to determine whether we can pilot them across the educational landscape.</p>, <p eid="para_755"> We are often accused in this House of being out of touch but very often we have our fingers on the pulse in terms of what is happening in our own communities. I have noticed an enormous amount of enthusiasm from pupils about trying to ensure the emotional and mental well being of their fellow pupils. I have not seen anything like the level of positivity that I have seen in the last two years, in terms of the willingness of pupils to engage with and try to help their fellow students. That is having a knock-on effect on overall well being within schools. The evidence for that may be anecdotal but we are seeing an improvement in this regard. </p>, <p eid="para_756"> I take the point made about the stresses and strains that teachers are under. I also understand their <i>in loco parentis</i> role in schools but schools are communities made up of students, teachers and parents, all working together. The question was asked as to whether we can specifically fund services for teachers who are in distress or under stress without also doing so for the wider populace but I do not know the answer to that. As to whether we can get specific schemes or pilot projects under way, I do not see why not. Wearing my research hat, I can say that it can be very easy to do so. Good ideas, like the CoderDojo initiative, for example, are very easily replicated across the landscape. If specific initiatives are being carried out in schools in certain areas at present, I do not see why they cannot be replicated across the country. There would be no additional cost because it is simply about learning from other schools and replicating that across the system. I am always happy to engage on this agenda.</p>]
[<p eid="para_758">The Department currently spends some €1.3 billion or 15% of its budget in support of children with special educational needs, including those with autism. Many children with autism are supported in mainstream schools where they are integrated with other children, including those with other special educational needs. These children have access to additional resource teaching hours and may have access to special needs assistants, SNAs, as required. Complete details on funding and staffing specifically to support children with autism is, therefore, not available. There are 540 classes specifically for children with autism. These classes are staffed with a ratio of one teacher and a minimum of two SNAs for every six children. Other supports include home tuition, special school transport arrangements, special equipment and training for teachers and parents. The National Council for Special Education is available to support parents who may be considering the most appropriate placement for their child or who are transitioning their child from primary to post-primary level.</p>]
[<p eid="para_764">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, which is specific to his area. Department officials and I would be very interested to hear how the process with the VEC could take shape, with a view to engaging further in the process. If we are talking about a very specific geographical location, my own view - without being in full possession of the facts of the case made by the Deputy - is that the issue should be considered seriously. I hope that is an acceptable response, although it may not fully answer the question with figures. If there is a specific project in which the Deputy or other Members are involved, and where the Department should be more active, I am quite happy to engage further with the Deputy on the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_766">If the Deputy could make a request to the senior Minister, I will refer to the fact that the issue was raised in the House, along with the matter raised by Deputy Keating.</p>]
[<p eid="para_772">I acknowledge each of the contributions. It is important to state that there are 540 autism-specific classes approved throughout the country. There are specific pockets where there are shortages or where issues may need to be addressed. They can be raised through this forum and on the floor of the House but also by way of direct representations to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, or parliamentary questions. With respect to Deputy Wallace, I would not be expected to be completely <i>au fait</i> with the school to which he refers. Perhaps he would table a parliamentary question to address the specific issue about the services rather than me giving a stock answer.</p>, <p eid="para_773"> There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistance is provided where the children require it, and sometimes on a one-to-one basis. Funding for home tuition is also available at ten hours per week for children with autism up to three years, increasing to 20 hours per week once the child is three years old if a placement is not available in an early intervention class. I do not know if that speaks directly to Deputy O'Brien's issue but we can engage further on it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_776">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 12 together.</p>, <p eid="para_777"> The surveys of parental preferences were undertaken largely in towns and suburbs. It was also open to parents of preschool or primary school children in rural areas or rural schools to participate in the surveys. The purpose of the surveys was to establish if parents want a more diverse range of primary school patrons in their area. Following on from the recent publication of the results of the surveys of primary school patronage, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has written to the Roman Catholic patrons in the 23 areas where parental demand for change has been confirmed in the most recent surveys. He has requested they consider options for reconfiguring schools under their patronage to allow the transfer of a school to a new patron. The Roman Catholic patrons have been asked to submit an interim response within three months and a final response with detailed proposals on divesting schools within six months. Earlier surveys had been conducted in five pilot areas and, as a result, options for change are also being considered in respect of these.</p>]
[<p eid="para_781">The surveys were conducted in 43 areas across the country. We have taken the responses to those surveys and are acting accordingly. There is a process under way with the existing patrons to consider the options. There is a timeframe for responses.</p>, <p eid="para_782"> The small schools issue has not been decided yet so the link with this issue is incongruous. The accusation of hypocrisy, therefore, does not stand. This goes back to the set pieces where questions are put to the Minister and the Deputy is entitled to make whatever political charges he wants. That is part and parcel of the game of politics. I do not see the link between the two, to be honest.</p>, <p eid="para_783"> Surveys were conducted in 43 areas and we should wait and see what the results were and what response the existing patrons will make.</p>]
[<p eid="para_789">None of us is averse to a bit of political banter from time to time but the purpose of this set-piece is to get to the nub of the questions. Following the recent publication of the results of the survey on primary school patronage, the Minister has written to the Catholic patrons in the 23 areas where parental demand for change has been confirmed in the most recent surveys. A total of 43 areas were surveyed for parental preferences on the patronage of primary schools. Two thirds of the 43 areas surveyed showed sufficient parental demand and, of the areas surveyed, there was sufficient parental demand for a wider choice of school patronage in 28 of those areas to support change in the patronage of schools.</p>, <p eid="para_790"> Parents expressed a preference for Educate Together as the alternative patron of choice in 25 of the areas and in two areas the alternative patron of choice was the local VEC and community national school model. That is the system of plurality. If in the majority, parents have decided on the existing system of patronage in their area, that is based on a model of collaboration with those parents who have voted with their feet. As a Government, we must respond accordingly. While the Minister might have made an aspirational statement coming from his own view, he is a reforming Minister and he has taken on board the views of parents articulated in these regions and this will be reflected in Government policy in due course.</p>, <p eid="para_791">

[<p eid="para_1064">The researchers funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, are connected to close to 650 distinct companies that employ more than 90,000 people in Ireland. These researchers also leverage significant research funding from non-Exchequer sources, such as the EU and industry, usually in the order of €80 million to €90 million per annum.</p>, <p eid="para_1065"> The SFI also supports more than 20 research centres across the country in fields such as the future Internet, food for health, energy, biomedicine and nanotechnology. Virtually all of the blue chip multinational companies in Ireland are connected to SFI in some way, for example, IBM, Cisco, Pfizer, Roche, HP, Intel, Merck, Microsoft and EMC. Many indigenous firms are also connected, such as the Kerry Group, Creganna and Sigmoid Pharma.</p>, <p eid="para_1066"> The significant investment made through the SFI by successive Governments since 2000 has been complemented by the ramping up in research investments by others in our national innovation system, for example, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Teagasc and others. The impact of this concentrated investment has been a major contributory factor in Ireland coming to be internationally regarded as a credible research-performing nation and is linked to why we have nine of the top ten big pharma-life science companies in the world, 15 of the world's top 25 ICT and technology companies and virtually all of the social media giants, with Dublin arguably now being the Internet capital of the world. Ireland ranked as one of the leading countries in the world for research and development investments.</p>, <p eid="para_1067"> The sustained research investments of the past decade or so are feeding through to the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI. Last year, more than 40% of IDA jobs announced were in companies with links to SFI research teams, accounting for 4,575 of the new IDA client jobs. This trend has continued in the first quarter of 2013, with the SFI being linked to 600 of the 1,100 new IDA jobs announced thus far. Already this year, major research and technology-related announcements have been made by the likes of McAfee, Yahoo, Nypro and Zurich.</p>, <p eid="para_1068"> Since 2004, we have seen a fivefold increase in the proportionality of research-related IDA FDI wins, from approximately 10% worth €120 million to an average of €600 million per annum for each of the past four years of the fiscal crisis, typically representing close to half of all new IDA wins. This State investment is also paying off for indigenous firms. Forfás data in the past three years show that the exports, employment and sustainability of research and development-performing firms consistently outperform those of firms not engaged in research and development. We have also seen a marked improvement in Ireland's international scientific rankings, from 36th in 2003 to breaking into the global top 20 in 2009. Despite our fiscal crisis, we have remained in the top 20.</p>, <p eid="para_1069"> We have caught up and surpassed many of our OECD competitors, but we cannot stand still. Ireland has reached a stage at which it is appropriate to define more precisely the areas wherein critical mass and concentration of our research effort will maximise further returns. This Bill will play an important part in that process.</p>, <p eid="para_1070"> To date, the SFI has focused exclusively on oriented basic research for enterprise development. Oriented basic research is defined as: "Research which is carried out with the expectation that it will produce a broad-base of knowledge likely to form the basis of the solution to recognised or expected, current or future problems or possibilities". Basic research is expected to produce results that form the basis for future applications, but which are, generally, some way off the commercial market.</p>, <p eid="para_1071"> The harsh realities of our current fiscal and economic crisis have made us all aware that there are competing and equally compelling demands for Exchequer investment, yet it is imperative that we ensure now, more than ever before, that we achieve the optimum impact from our research investment. Extending SFI's remit to support applied research will be a contributory factor in this regard. Applied research is usually undertaken either to determine possible uses for the findings of basic research or to determine new methods or ways of creating practical applications.</p>, <p eid="para_1072"> I will briefly refer to the 11 sections of the Bill and I will then elaborate on some of the more significant sections. Sections 1 and 3 set out the definition of terms used in the Bill. Section 2 relates to the expenses incurred by the Minister via the annual financial allocation being made to SFI - to be paid out of moneys voted on and provided by the Oireachtas. Section 4 sets out the revised functions of SFI, which include supporting research priority areas, applied research and science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, activities. Section 5 relates to the provision by the foundation of funding on a wider geographical basis - and seeks to include researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, as well as participating in certain international collaborative projects.</p>, <p eid="para_1073"> Section 6 provides for a consequential amendment to the 2003 Act governing SFI's reporting requirements under its annual reports. Section 7 provides for the repeal of the provisions relating to compilation of the so-called science budget by Forfás. Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the IDA in relation to the Shannon region. Section 9 provides for the new provisions for collection of research and development data by Forfás in place of the provisions repealed by section 7. Section 10 facilitates the amendment of the confidentiality provisions applying to El and SFI in the Freedom of Information Acts. Section 11 provides for the Short Title of the Act, and related citation and commencement provisions.</p>, <p eid="para_1074"> The critical sections of the Bill that are intended to facilitate the realignment of Ireland's research and development policy and that are most relevant to SFI actions are sections 3, 4, and 5. Section 3 provides for the amendment of section 2(1) of the Act of 2003 in respect of the terms used in same, particularly as regards the introduction of a definition of "applied research". It will also enable SFI to refocus its funding towards the priority areas as identified in the recommendations of the research prioritisation steering group chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel. The group identified 14 priority areas of opportunity for Ireland and six underpinning technologies and infrastructure to support these priority areas. The priority areas were chosen on the basis of the existing strengths of our enterprise base, opportunities that exist in terms of the global marketplace and those which are most likely to deliver economic and societal impact and ultimately good jobs for this country. The report of the group was approved by the Government and published in March 2012. The Bill will assist the implementation of some of the research prioritisation recommendations, which involves a process I am currently chairing across 14 prioritisation action group areas.</p>, <p eid="para_1075"> Section 4 lays out the revised functions of SFI. It provides for amendments to section 7 of the Industrial Development Act 2003, in particular in respect of extending SFI's legislative remit to enable it to fund applied research. Applied research is defined as: "Work undertaken in order to gain scientific or technical knowledge and directed towards a specific practical application." Enterprise Ireland administers a number of research and development programmes involving direct grants to companies to develop and support industry-led, market-focused applied research. However, these El programmes start at a stage in advance of the point where many researchers find themselves, as the possible uses for their basic research results have not yet been explored. Therefore, a gap exists within our existing research ecosystem that impedes the pursuit of the potential applied research opportunities that often arise from oriented basic research. By extending SFI's remit to include applied research the Bill will take the outcomes of the oriented basic research funded by SFI closer to market, increasing the potential of our research to yield commercial opportunities, jobs, and other societal benefits.</p>, <p eid="para_1076"> At this juncture I will refer to some recent misinformed commentary in various media on research prioritisation and the extension of SFI's remit into the applied research arena, for instance, that such actions signal a so-called death knell for fundamental basic research in Ireland and that the Government is no longer committed to science, technology and innovation. This commentary does not reflect what is actually happening. On 25 February 2013, we had the largest ever research announcement of its kind in this country, involving seven large-scale research centres, supporting 800 researchers, and representing a total investment of €300 million over the next six years, €200 million of which will be provided by the Exchequer via SFI and a further €100 million coming from more than 150 industry partners. At the end of January, we also had €60.8 million of new SFI investigators awards across a range of fundamental research areas, primarily the life sciences, ICT, mathematics and energy. In November 2012, SFI also announced €30 million in key research infrastructure awards. All three of these significant research announcements by Government, through SFI, are underpinned by talented basic research scientists. All of the above is of direct relevance to supporting basic research excellence in this country that is directly relevant to our economic and societal development. One can add to those examples the fact that SFI's budget for 2013 was maintained at very close to 2012 levels, as was the basic research funding allocation of approximately €35 million being provided to the Irish Research Council this year.</p>, <p eid="para_1077"> To return to section 4, this section also includes a new function to enable SFI to promote and support awareness and understanding of STEM. That was originally a function of the discover science and engineering, DSE, programme initiated by Forfás in 2003, the objective being to heighten STEM awareness so as to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and mathematics; promote a positive attitude to STEM careers; and foster a greater public understanding of the physical sciences, engineering and mathematics, and their value to society. In March 2012, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, transferred responsibility for delivery of the DSE programme from Forfás to SFI on an administrative basis. The Bill now puts SFI's science awareness activities on a proper legislative footing. Where appropriate, SFI will consult the Minister for Education and Skills on STEM related issues. The House will be aware that I am Minister of State in both of those Departments.</p>, <p eid="para_1078"> Moving on to section 5, under the Industrial Development Act 2003 as it stands, SFI at present does not have the power to directly fund research groups outside the Republic of Ireland. Section 5 will grant additional powers for SFI to provide funding to researchers and institutions based in Northern Ireland, thereby advancing opportunities for collaboration between research groups North and South. This section will also allow SFI, subject to the Minister's consent, to enter cost-share collaborative research arrangements with international partners in areas where Irish researchers have real potential to achieve added value from such arrangements. International collaboration on research brings together resources, pools knowledge, enhances scientific excellence, and thereby achieves greater success in addressing research problems and delivering greater efficiencies. It opens up access to external non-Exchequer funding, facilities and networking opportunities for Irish researchers that would not otherwise be available. When opportunities arise, it is important for Ireland, through SFI and other national funders, to be ready and available to participate in international programmes in areas where Ireland has research strengths.</p>, <p eid="para_1079">The European Commission's proposals for research and innovation funding for the period 2014 to 2020, Horizon 2020, include allocation of co-funding for member state collaborations, subject to "clear financial commitments of the participating countries, including prior commitments to pool national and-or regional investments for transnational research and innovation". Therefore, as part of Ireland's efforts to maximise our drawdown from EU research funding, it will be necessary to be in the right position to engage in EU common-pot arrangements, where appropriate.</p>, <p eid="para_1080"> I will turn briefly to some of the other matters dealt with in the Bill, in sections 7, 8, 9 and 10. Section 8 repeals the restrictions on Enterprise Ireland, EI and IDA <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Shannon region. By so doing, the Bill will facilitate the reorganisation of enterprise development functions in the Shannon free zone. In 2011, in recognition of the severe financial difficulties that Shannon Development faced following the collapse of the property market, the Government agreed to review the future role of that agency. Deputies will be aware that Shannon Development engages in property transactions and, unfortunately, the crash has severely impacted upon the company's ability to raise revenue in this way. Following careful consideration of this matter, the Government agreed in principle in May 2012 to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and to merge Shannon Airport and Shannon Development into a new aviation-focused entity which would lead to the optimisation of enterprise development arrangements in the region. The Government decision also provided for the transfer of Shannon Development's functions relating to indigenous enterprise and foreign direct investment, FDI, to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, respectively, and directed that a plan for the delivery of those functions by these agencies be developed.</p>, <p eid="para_1081"> In September 2012, when seeking approval to draft the appropriate amending legislation to enable IDA Ireland and El operate in the Shannon free zone, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, indicated he was happy to take this step in advance of any further legislative changes that would be required to create the new entity. Subsequently, in late November 2012, the Government considered further proposals submitted by Deputy Bruton and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. The Government confirmed its earlier decision that a merged, State-owned, commercial entity be established, NewCo, by 1 July 2013, comprising the Shannon Airport Authority and a restructured Shannon Development to exploit its combined assets as a catalyst for the development of sectoral opportunities, particularly within the aviation sector, including the creation of an international aviation centre of excellence centred on the airport. The process is ongoing and involves the drafting of comprehensive legislation to create the new aviation-focused company. I assure the House that this is a priority item for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, working in consultation with my Department. Progress on this exciting project is being monitored by a high level steering group.</p>, <p eid="para_1082"> Sections 7 and 9 provide for reform of the legislation governing the collection of research and development data by Forfás. The Science and Technology Act 1987 provides for the preparation by Forfás of a science budget on a periodic basis and obliges bodies funded under the science budget to supply to Forfás such information in such form and at such time as it may require. The data, collated and published biannually by Forfás as the science budget, measures overall expenditure on science and technology in the Government sector. However, the areas of expenditure measured do not align with current international practice for the monitoring of science, technology and innovation, STI, expenditure. Consequently, the resulting survey is neither a useful policy tool nor an effective use of staff resources. Therefore, deletion of these provisions via section 7 is proposed for administrative efficiency.</p>, <p eid="para_1083"> Through section 9, Forfás will continue to compile, on an annual basis, a major component of the science budget, known as government budget appropriations or outlays on research and development, GBAORD. This is an internationally comparable metric carried out using harmonised concepts and definitions from the OECD and is required under an EU Commission regulation relating to statistics on science and technology.</p>, <p eid="para_1084"> Section 10 affords an opportunity to align the legislation governing SFI and El with the Freedom of Information Acts, specifically by facilitating amendment of the confidentiality provisions that apply to both agencies. While the FOI Acts apply to both agencies, at present section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1998 in respect of El, and section 17 of the 2003 Act in respect of SFI, prohibit disclosure of confidential information by board members, staff and other specified persons. Through this Bill it is proposed to make these sections subject to the FOI Acts, thereby allowing for disclosure of confidential information in accordance with those Acts.</p>, <p eid="para_1085"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>]
