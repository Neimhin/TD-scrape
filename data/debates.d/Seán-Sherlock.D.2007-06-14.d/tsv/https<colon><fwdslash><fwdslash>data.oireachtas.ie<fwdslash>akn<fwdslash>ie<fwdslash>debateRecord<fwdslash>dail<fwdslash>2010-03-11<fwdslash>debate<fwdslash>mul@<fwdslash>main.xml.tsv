SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The reason I asked the question is because we have an opportunity in this country to phase out such fuels as coal and they can quite easily be replaced by miscanthus.  Farmers tell me that the establishment costs are quite high and that the grant could be improved, if possible, to assist in that regard.  Did I hear the Minister of State correctly when he stated that he is precluded by European Union rules from expanding or increasing that level of grant aid?  I ask him to expand on that point.  Once the crop has been established, is there any scope to improve the increments for weed control, the control of pests and also ploughing and cultivation?  If he is unable to increase the grant for the establishment of the crop, perhaps he could consider an increase on the embedded side, if I could use that expression.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Will the Minister of State agree there are many companies facilitating farmers in establishing the crop in the first instance and that the expertise exists?  Will he acknowledge the potential for this crop and that perhaps the Government is under-valuing the potential of this crop in meeting an alternative energy need?  Will he also acknowledge that there may be a reluctance on the part of farmers to switch into this crop because the scheme itself is undersold?  The Government needs to do a marketing job to encourage more farmers to diversify into this crop, given the level of expertise, particularly in the east Cork and west Limerick regions where two companies that are market leaders are only itching to get more farmers under their ambit but they need a greater financial incentive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I was unsure whether the question related to competition policy or food labelling, but I will address both matters while I have the opportunity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate that.  Will the Minster acknowledge in respect of food labelling that there is no willingness on the part of certain EU countries to proceed with a change to the country of origin labelling regime in operation at present, because it would materially affect their trade and the issue of substantial transformation?  If there were a real political initiative at EU level in respect of this issue, the Government and the Green Party would be shouting about it from the rooftops.  Let us not be disingenuous about it.I refer to the Competition Act.  I appreciate the Spanish EU Presidency is taking initiatives in respect of this issue but there is already a considerable body of law on the Irish Statute Book.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the Competition Act 2002, which incorporates the treaty on the functioning of the EU, prohibits agreements and concerted practices which have as their "object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade on any goods"?  Will the Minister further acknowledge that upon the abolition of the groceries order in December 2005 it was stated that certain unilateral action on the part of non-dominant undertakings in the groceries trade would effectively be legislated for——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The dearth of legislation is causing the situation we have at the moment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Has the Minister of State an opinion on the fact that the committee took a unanimous decision across all of the political party boundaries and across the political spectrum, and that such decision was based on hearing a corpus of evidence from all sides?  I respectfully suggest to the Minister of State that he must take cognisance of the fact that it is a unanimous view, which should be taken seriously by him in determining the final outcome, and that when the committee took the view, it did so on the basis that the aims of the Irish Draught Horse Society were not mutually exclusive from those of HSI and that there would be no threat to HSI by ceding the studbook to the Irish Draught Horse Society.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order,——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——I respect the views of the Minister of State but the line Minister is sitting right beside him.  Is it in order for me to ask whether the senior Minister in the Department would have a view on this or would proffer a view to the House on this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is very much a case of "Yes, Minister".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am amazed at how we operate this Parliament, which needs to be seriously modernised and overhauled.  It is ludicrous.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I just had a surreal moment.  I felt I had a bit-part in "Yes, Minister."
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——weighty advice but we need to speak to a little bit of common sense as well.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is there a final position on the EU's position in terms of this negotiation or are there continuous bilateral talks on the Irish position at the WTO?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The decline in farm employment has been stark.  The loss of employment in the construction industry, as acknowledged by the Minister, is also having a major bearing on off-farm employment.A report by David Meredith of Teagasc's rural economy research centre in Kinsealy, County Dublin, highlighted that 70% of farmers recorded lower secondary education as their highest qualification, meaning they are more vulnerable to an economic downturn.  If only 6% of farmers have a third level degree, will the Minister agree more has to be done to encourage young farmers to up-skill so if they need an off-farm income they will have good employment choices and still be able to part-time farm?  Will he also agree it is important to provide proper resources to the agricultural colleges?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The rate of decline was from 115,000 in 2008 to 98,000 in 2009.  Not all of the agricultural colleges will be able to take up that slack to re-educate these farmers.  While I appreciate the Minister's response, he will have to widen the scope of the existing education policy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In support of Deputy McGinley's point, will the Government extend an invitation as per the Labour Party request to facilitate the Ombudsman in one of the committees to allow her to present the findings in her report?
