SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, subsection (1), line 2, to delete "2 years" and substitute "1 year".I ask the Minister of State to set out the Government's rationale for introducing a two-year period for retaining data in the case of telephony and a one-year period in the case of Internet data.  I seek a clearer view of the Government's position in this matter before justifying my amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With respect, I asked the Minister to speak to my amendment in order that I could then respond.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I presume that I am entitled to respond to the Government's justification for its position on the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State's justification for the Government's position, vis-à-vis the two-year retention period for telephony and the one-year retention period for Internet data, is on the basis of security and counter-terrorism measures.  I understand that rationale and no one would argue against it, but I take issue with the time periods.  That is the reason we have sought to have them reduced from two years to one and from one year to six months, respectively.  In the context of the transposition of a directive that dates back to 2006, one speaks to the historical context of that directive and also refers to any subsequent legislation enacted that has more than adequately dealt with counter-terrorism or crime prevention measures such as the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act.  I am looking at the permutations of the Government’s position vis-à-vis the cost to business.  I submit that placing on Internet service providers or telephony companies an obligation that they must store data for two years would result in an undue cost burden.  One will not have an impact in terms of crime prevention or detection if one has existing legislation on surveillance.The average period in Europe for the retention of data varies.  In France there is a one-year time period.  In Germany it is six months.  Holland, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Romania all favour a six-month period also.  We should be mindful of where we are coming from.  We are talking about the transposition of a directive, therefore, let us look at the historical perspective.  We must consider whether there is a necessity to have the periods at two years and one year, respectively.  I submit that there is not.  I ask the Government to examine the industry-wide position, which is significant because of the cost burden on business that will have an impact on Irish businesses, and also the average retention periods across the European Union.  All I ask is that the Minister of State look at that matter and report back on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The period of retention applied with a view to protecting one's human rights could equally be shorter.  There is no restriction in this regard.  Nobody argues against the need to protect human rights.  I am not sure if the Minster of State understands my point.  If, for instance, one refers to the Internet as relatively new technology and considers all the various components, including social networking websites, and factors such as the number of e-mails one receives and the number of hits on websites, one will realise that, by extending the timeframe, one is building into the legislation a mechanism whereby Internet service providers and telephony companies will be subject to a cost burden.  Let me be clear that nobody argues against the principle of data storage.  My point on shorter timeframes in other member states is based on the fact that, if these states have shorter timeframes and ours is the longest allowable, we are putting ourselves at a comparative disadvantage relative to the other countries competing on an e-commerce platform with this country.  One must bear in mind an average person's Internet usage, including the number of websites visited and whether the person uses Bebo, Facebook, Twitter or other such websites.  If all the hits must be stored by the ISP, this imposes an undue cost on it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To finish my point, if it is to be proved that an individual visited a particular website or that a message was sent from person A to person B over the Internet, through Facebook or otherwise, one is imposing a cost on the ISP.  It is a question of competitiveness.  We have long since moved on from the directive in terms of the threat posed prior to its instigation.  The Government is now going too far down the line.  I do not argue this point from a civil liberties perspective but from an economic and cost to business perspective.  The ability of the Garda to investigate is already well met by existing surveillance legislation.  If one added a six-month or one-year period in regard to telephony and Internet access, it would be more than adequate.  Will the Minister of State reconsider this matter and revert to me on Report Stage?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is unrelated to the legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Chairman, may I——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Let us revert to the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If one takes that example——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State distinguished between the content and the storing of data.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Let me finish the point, as I also wish to make that distinction.  The data must be stored.  I agree that the content of a message or e-mail is the subject of a different point.  I also agree that one must store data on the interaction or communication between two parties.  However, discussing a murder investigation is not realistic.  Thanks to the surveillance Act, I guarantee the Minister of State that his argument on this legislation will not prove valid.  Most of the information gleaned from communications via telephony will have been gleaned within a period of one year or six months.  The statistics will bear this out down the line.  There is a storage component.  The UK Government made a fund of £20 million available to Internet service providers and telephony companies for the same process.  The Government is going beyond what the UK Government did, despite the fact that the latter's position on the detection of crime is more sensitive in terms of the need for counter-terrorism measures.  We are trying to create a competitive environment for businesses.  Allowing for a period of one year would be reasonable.  Reducing it from two years would not impact negatively on the detection of crimes such as the one outlined by the Minister of State.  It was disingenuous of him to mention that case, as in doing so he deliberately sought to obscure the point of my amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I did not use the word "redundant".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, subsection (1), line 3, to delete "one year" and substitute "6 months".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 5, subsection (4), line 20, after "State" to insert the following:"and includes traffic data or location data and the related data, generated or processed within the State, necessary to identify the subscriber or user and includes only data relating to services provided to the user and not to data travelling across networks".Ironically, this amendment seeks to strengthen the provision which reads: "The data referred to in subsection (1) include data relating to unsuccessful call attempts that, in the case of data specified in Part 1 of Schedule 2, are stored in the State, or in the case of data specified in Part 2 of Schedule 2, are logged in the State”.  The question of jurisdiction comes into play, as we are discussing data stored within the State.  I believe in the fundamental concept of storing data for the prevention of crime; therefore, strengthening the provision is the concept behind my amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will not press the amendment, as I accept the Minister of State's comments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 5, subsection (1)(d), line 43, before “, shall” to insert the following:"or that are the subject of a request under section 6”.This amendment seeks to strengthen the provisions of section 6.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In essence, the purpose of the amendment was to ensure data would not be destroyed once a request for disclosure is made.  I accept the Minister of State's response in this regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 6, subsection (5), lines 41 and 42, to delete all words from and including "within" in line 41 down to and including "made" in line 42 and substitute "forthwith".If an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, a colonel or a member of the Garda not below the rank chief superintendent phones an ISP or makes a disclosure request by telephone, this amendment seeks to ensure that the request comes in writing immediately.  I would have used the word "immediately", but I am advised that I must use the word "forthwith".  If a request is made, this amendment ensures that it is backed up immediately in writing.  Given the lackadaisical approach to carrying out requests sometimes, a phone call might be made but we might wait up to two months for the subsequent request for disclosure in writing.  I just want to strengthen that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 6, after line 42, to insert the following new section:7.—A provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope in that the request is not so wide as to place an undue cost on the service provider.".I speak again to the commercial cost to the ISP or telephone company.  If a disclosure request comes in and if it is as wide ranging as a chief superintendent determines it should be, then we have to be mindful of the cost to the service provider in yielding up that information.Before the Minister of State throws the criminal investigation argument at me, I am trying to speak to common sense.  We do not want a chief superintendent or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners coming in with a disclosure request that is not focused, not narrow, or not targeted.  They may trawl the net as wide as possible.  Some degree of common sense should be applied whereby they are mindful of the cost to the ISP or the telephone company.There is no fund available to the ISPs or the telephone companies to meet the costs of the storage of this data, unlike in the UK.  There would obviously be an implied cost to them to provide the data.  We effectively want a degree of common sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does the Minister of State agree with me?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The memorandum of association to which the Minister of State refers is only a memorandum of association and it is not on a statutory footing.  It is not backed up by law.  Section 7 states: "A service provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider".  One of the parties to the memorandum of association is the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, ISPAI.  Its submission on this legislation states that section 7 is far too wide and unwieldy and takes no account of what is reasonable, technically possible and not very expensive.  Its recommendation is that a provider shall comply with a disclosure request made to the service provider only where it is technically possible and reasonable in scope, namely, that the request is not so wide as to be very expensive to service.  My amendment is based on the wording of the submission of the ISPAI on this legislation.I understand what the Minister of State is saying about the memorandum of understanding.  Active stakeholders from the telephony and Internet service providers buy into the process.  We will make the assumption that their actions arising from this are based on common sense.  We are lawmakers and I am a little concerned about this provision.  It could be taken advantage of to trawl too widely.  The memorandum of understanding may not have any bearing because, once the request is made, there is no recourse to law.  If an Internet service provider is met by a request for disclosure, the Internet service provider must adhere.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	There is no sanction against the service provider for not adhering.  I take the subtlety of the point.  Ireland is a small country and if I am an Internet service provider and I am phoned by the local chief superintendent asking for certain information, I am hardly going to refuse.  If that person was of a mind to trawl the net widely and I found it technically difficult to come up with that information within a reasonable timeframe, that creates problems.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State refers to the designated judge and the oversight judge.  One must consider the actions of that judge over the past number of years and consider whether that person had the resources to investigate the applications of the Act under which the judge operates.  Since the position was created in 1993, it can be argued that this consisted of no more than a single line every year stating that the operation of the Act has been kept under review and its provisions have been complied with.  There has been no discussion of the steps taken to keep the operation of the Act under review, whether individual files were reviewed, the volume of surveillance being carried out and whether mistakes were made in carrying out surveillance.  This concerns the report on the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, under which there is a designated judge.  I presume this provision has the same arrangements.  In principle, the oversight judge is a fantastic concept.  Whether the judge has the resources to carry out the provisions to which the Minister of State referred is a moot point.  I oppose this provision.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Can I interpret from this that the Minister of State will review it for Report Stage?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I accept the Minister of State's response.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 7, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:"(4) A report under this section shall contain details of the numbers of prosecutions actually commenced as a result of investigations to which requests related, and a detailed justification for any significant excess of numbers of requests over numbers of prosecutions actually commenced.".The justification for this amendment is that it speaks to a qualitative provision we are trying to work into the legislation which would ensure justification for a request for disclosure to rule against the possibility of requests for disclosures for nefarious purposes.  We are trying to ensure that if an innocent person becomes the subject of a disclosure request that a numerical value is put on it in the sense of the quantity of requests made.  One can then examine the number of prosecutions and tally up the ratio of requests made to prosecutions.  We are trying to ensure a degree of transparency in the provisions under the section.  We are also seeking to offset the risk of somebody using the provision in the law for wrongful purposes
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I strain to understand the Minister of State's logic.  He spoke about vindicating individual rights but the amendment highlights a potentially gross disparity between numbers of requests and the ensuing prosecutions.He referred to reviews of the working of the directive.  We seek to protect the rights of individuals in respect of whom disclosure is requested.  Under the Bill as it stands, an individual can only find out if a disclosure request has been made by first making a request to the Data Protection Commissioner on the basis that he or she believes personal data has been accessed.  We seek to require that a report be prepared which contains details of the number of prosecutions commenced as a result of requests for information.  We want quantitative rather than qualitative assessments.  Such a provision would offset the risk of somebody in a position of power seeking disclosure for purposes other than the investigation of a criminal, revenue or secret service matter.  We are trying to balance the need for data against the rights of the individual.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will consider withdrawing the amendment if I can be assured that we will further discuss the issues arising on Report Stage.  I accept the Minister of State's objections in good faith.  He acknowledges the aim of the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 8, subsection (5), line 29, after "fit," to insert the following:"and with due regard to the rights of any person whose life, bodily integrity or property was sought to be vindicated in the criminal investigation concerned,".The purpose of the amendment is to ensure some balance in the question of how to deal with a minor breach of section 6.  If there is a breach, the user will be notified and may be compensated but if any prosecution is to be quashed as a result of destruction of the evidence on the orders of the Data Protection Commissioner, there must be consideration of the rights of the victim concerned.  This is a qualitative look at the legislation to ensure that it does not militate against people who are completely innocent and law-abiding citizens.  They should have some degree of recourse.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have previously raised the next matter.  Considering the reports which have been published under those Acts, they have quite literally consisted of one or two lines stating that the provisions of the Act have been adhered to.  They have been signed by the relevant person.  The danger is that this will be a complaints procedure in name only and is not backed up by any real or substantive provisions.The Minister of State and I both know he is lessening the provision for an innocent person against whom a disclosure request is made, and decreasing his or her chance of recourse.  It is weak legislation; that is the point I am making.  I agree there must be data retention, as we all do, but the provisions allowing for recourse for somebody who is innocent are weak as water.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 22:
In page 9, line 45, after "repealed" to insert the following:"and where any data retained or accessed thereunder are adduced in evidence after the passing of this Act, such data shall be deemed to have been lawfully retained or accessed at all material times notwithstanding such repeal".In order to be off assistance I accept the Minister's amendment and am happy to withdraw mine, if that is in order.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 24:
In page 10, paragraph 4, line 10, to delete "1995" and substitute "2005".This corrects an error in the collective citation by including a reference to section 1(4) of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister of State for his assistance in this.  It was not my intention to deliberately make life difficult for the Parliamentary Counsel but we believed the matter was significant.
