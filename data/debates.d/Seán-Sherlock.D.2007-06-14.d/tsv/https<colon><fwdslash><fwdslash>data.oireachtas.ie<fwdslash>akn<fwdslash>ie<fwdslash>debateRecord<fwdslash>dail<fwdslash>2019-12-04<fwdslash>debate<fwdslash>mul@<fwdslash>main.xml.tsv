SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T17:40:00+00:00	The Acting Chairman is very kind. I thank my colleague and I apologise for not being here on time. I congratulate the Minister because I genuinely believe he made a decent effort in bringing the Bill before us. The process started with Grace O'Sullivan, MEP. I have had some pitched battles, if I could put it that way, with the Minister on occasion in respect of this legislation and we had one or two stand-up rows. Notwithstanding the Minister's current travails, he genuinely sought to legislate for this matter and I appreciate his efforts in that regard. I told him this could be his lasting legacy. I am not sure about the housing issue, but this certainly could be something that will be part of his legacy as Minister and I congratulate him in that regard. I want to satisfy myself that the issues raised on Second Stage have been comfortably dealt with and that, once the legislation comes into effect, we will ban microplastics in this country. I again seek that reassurance from the Minister. As I said, the former Senator, Grace O'Sullivan, MEP, started the ball rolling on this legislation. We in the Labour Party took up the cudgel and I accept that the Minister has been genuine in his attempt to legislate and make Ireland, as an island nation, a forerunner in western Europe on this vital issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T17:50:00+00:00	I was just going to say that the idea of a recommittal, if the Minister of State is amenable, would not be a bad idea. We will, however, be directed by him on this issue. The Acting Chairman has been very helpful in allowing us to come back in and make contributions. Technically, we should not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T17:50:00+00:00	These issues are not the subject of amendments either, and that is why we are seeking this clarification.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T17:50:00+00:00	I am grateful to the Acting Chairman. Regarding section 9, the Minister of State has already provided clarity to us, outside of this House, regarding those clubs we all represent, including GAA clubs, community organisations etc. that run bingo games on a Friday night. I refer to a local volunteer calling the balls in the game where perhaps €1,000 is brought in and €800 is paid out in prizes, with a small surplus going back into the community organisation or the GAA club. The Minister of State would be doing us a great service if he were to give us some comfort by confirming that such activities will not fall foul of this legislation. I also refer to the rollover of GAA lotteries run on a community basis, as Deputy Scanlon mentioned. There is much worry abroad regarding whether local GAA lotteries, in particular, will be allowed to roll over under this legislation. I thank the Acting Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T18:30:00+00:00	I signal my party's intention to support the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T18:50:00+00:00	I will speak in the same vein as Deputy Scanlon and refer to parish and community organisations, an example of which is to be found in Kildorrery in my own native Cork. A bingo game is run there which takes in approximately €1,100 and approximately €900 is paid out. I will refer to the point made by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, although he may be on the phone and indisposed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T18:50:00+00:00	With regard to the Deputy's point, the prize fund in this particular instance is predetermined. I seek clarification from the Minister of State. Will the proposed section 26A apply to this particular operation? This section states:Section 26 shall not apply to a lottery where—(a) the total value of the prizes is not more than €1,000,(b) the price of each ticket is not more than €5,(c) the maximum number of tickets sold is not more than 1,500,(d) the lottery is conducted for the benefit of a charitable or philanthropic purpose, and(e) the promoter of the lottery derives no personal profit from the lottery and has not conducted a lottery in accordance with this section during the preceding 3 months.To be fair to the Minister of State, he is my constituency colleague and I do not believe he would seek to shut down operations such as this. I welcome the opportunity for the Minister of State to give these voluntary organisations some clarity and comfort tonight. To return to the bingo game in Kildorrery, and in every community across the land, it makes a few bob for the GAA, the local development association and community endeavours. It is not for profit. If the Minister of State will clarify that point, I am sure many of us will be very satisfied. I am sure he will do so. The second issue is about how roll-over jackpots will be dealt with under this legislation. I am confident the Minister of State will provide some clarity on this issue as well. My final point relates to circumstances in which a GAA club, for example, gives away a house as a prize. This has been known to happen. A number of GAA clubs across the country are now selling tickets for raffles or lotteries in which the prize is a house. What will be the threshold for such lotteries? There is reference to a figure of €360,000 in the legislation. Given the value of particular houses in particular parts of the country, that threshold of €360,000 could easily be surpassed. I am coming from a place of ignorance in this regard. I seek to be educated by the Minister of State on that point. Those are the key points. I recognise that they do not strictly relate to the set of amendments now being discussed but they are the issues exercising many of us at this point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T19:20:00+00:00	Two minutes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T20:30:00+00:00	I am, again, seeking clarification on the rollover jackpots. For example, Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, Ballingeary, which is not in my constituency, currently has a lottery jackpot of €15,000. It was €14,800 last week and, as it was not won, it is increasing by €200 this week. I may have misheard the Minister of State when he spoke about rollover jackpots previously. I am seeking clarification on whether the GAA club that runs that lottery is now required to apply for a licence.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-12-04T20:30:00+00:00	I am not sure of the history of this particular lottery but my understanding is that under section 26(a) if the total prize is under €1,000 it would not have to apply for a permit or a licence but by dint of a rollover mechanism it now has to apply for a licence. I am seeking clarification on whether it has to make a weekly application or if it is a once off process once it goes over the terms of section 26(a) if that is what its intention was in the first instance. I hope that makes sense.
