[<p eid="para_568">The issue I am raising concerns the pending case against Ireland by the European Commission at the European Court of Justice in regard to the failure by the State, between 2000 and 2005, to meet deadlines set for the upgrading of existing sewage treatment plants and completion of new plants. That failure is affecting 38 towns throughout the country, including Cork city, Fermoy, Mallow, Midleton, Ballincollig, Ringaskiddy, Youghal and Rathcormak in County Cork; Gweedore, Killybegs and Ballybofey in County Donegal; Tipperary, Roscrea and Thurles in County Tipperary; as well as, among others, Kilkenny, Dundalk, Enniscorthy and Killarney. Ireland had until the end of 2005 to ensure any urban area with a population base of more than 15,000 had adequate sewage treatment facilities to prevent discharges from those medium-sized towns into rivers, lakes and estuaries. It is a public health issue.</p>, <p eid="para_569"> We are experiencing some turmoil in this House at the moment on the issue of water charges. In that context, I am concerned there may not be enough capital funding available to complete sewage and wastewater treatment plant upgrades. Irish Water has estimated that all sewage treatment plants will be upgraded by 2021, at a slated cost of €1.2 billion. In the current climate, however, with the ongoing debate on water charges, it seems likely there may be slippage on that target. Will the Minister give an assurance to the affected towns that they will have access to reliable, adequate and safe wastewater and sewage treatment plants? Will he further guarantee there will be no slippage in the budget line and that the targets which need to be met by 2021 will continue to be met?</p>]
[<p eid="para_577">I thank the Minister of State for engaging with me on this issue and I recognise that blame is laid at successive Governments' doors. We have not tackled this issue as a country in as proactive a way as we should have.</p>, <p eid="para_578"> If we are to have a debate on the future of water and wastewater treatment services, I am not convinced that the current investment plan will be followed through and that the Government can guarantee that capital expenditure will be made available to meet the needs of the remaining 38 towns and agglomerations identified by the European Commission. We must ensure that the capital expenditure is locked down regardless of the outcome of the committee's deliberations when it reports to the House. This is a public safety issue, one in which the health of our citizens comes into play, and we need to maintain an investment plan. There has never been a more opportune time to do so.</p>, <p eid="para_579"> I worry that water and wastewater investment will slip down the agenda. If it competes with, for example, capital expenditure on roads, schools or hospitals, all of which are necessary, it will become the poor relation even though it is most vital to our needs. I hope that we can continue to ensure that the budget of €1 billion plus for the investment plan is locked down so that the 2021 target can be achieved and the needs of the 38 towns and agglomerations will be catered for.</p>]
[<p eid="para_584">Is the €1 billion secured?</p>]
[<p eid="para_586">Regardless of the charging regime?</p>]
[<p eid="para_689">We support the motion. Setanta's collapse has left in its wake 1,700 open claims for compensation, which remain unsettled at a cost of approximately €95.2 million. The collapse of Enterprise Insurance has left 14,000 motorists with €6 million outstanding. One company was regulated in Malta, the other in Gibraltar. Of the 39 insurance companies listed as members of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, 11 are domiciled in Gibraltar when one excludes the Lloyds list.</p>, <p eid="para_690"> The proceedings before the Supreme Court allow interested parties to hide until such time as the Supreme Court has found in favour of one side or the other. The Government may also be hiding behind the Supreme Court decision because, although it announced the extension of the insurance compensation fund in July 2016, it seems the Minister is now saying a legislative proposal to implement the report will be brought to Government for approval in the coming months. He did not use the words "heads of a Bill" and there seems to be some slippage already in the timelines for legislation to provide certainty in this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_691"> The finance committee has done much work to tackle the issues articulated by Deputies Neville and Ó Laoghaire on the particular circumstances in which motorists find themselves, particularly those who have been priced out of the market by virtue of the fact that they had to emigrate and are now returning home. We require certainty to plug the glaring lacuna in the legislation around this matter. If it is not addressed, there is the prospect of motorists having loading costs on their premiums of up to €80. The MIBI documentation contains estimates that the cost of claims for their members, against uninsured and untraced drivers, is north of €58.4 million. The MIBI states that Setanta poses a liability of €90 million, the impact of which is an additional €52.</p>, <p eid="para_692"> The Supreme Court has to iron out how Irish law understands the responsibility of MIBI. Other Members have referred to timelines but this goes back to September 2015 and the first High Court judgment. The latest instalment was the October 2016 reserve judgment. I am delighted that the Government is abstaining on the motion because there is agreement on the broad principles of the motion. The consumer demands are very clear.</p>, <p eid="para_693">They want transparency and easily accessible information on the products they are purchasing. They also want to know, in a simple format, if the liquidity and provisioning arrangements for those insurance houses, from which they are purchasing products, are robust so as to offset the risk of non-payment of claims in the future. Consumers quite simply demand transparency and easily accessible information, which is something that will have to be dealt with.</p>, <p eid="para_694"> I acknowledge what the Minister said about the Central Bank conducting a thematic review and inspection of managing general agents or MGAs. However, we need further information and clarity on what that means.</p>, <p eid="para_695"> While we support the motion, it is important to have legal certainty on the Setanta issue and other insurance houses. Motorists with legitimate expectations have been waiting too long for justice, despite having judgments in their favour for recognised claims.</p>]
