SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 32 I seek to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the governance structures as they relate to charitable organisations, specifically in respect of Right of Place, and the need to ensure transparency where Exchequer funding applies to such organisations.  Further, to examine the 2009 service agreement between Right of Place and the HSE and whether such a service agreement existed prior to this date; whether the requirement to furnish details of the governance structure of Right of Place and the interrelationship with the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE and existing religious orders has been expedited; to call into account details of the 2009 annual general meeting of Right of Place, its board structures and the publication of its annual reports; to publish details of established company accounts where such accounts exist; whether it should be necessary for the Garda Síochána to be called in to investigate the role of the HSE and its relationship with Right of Place; to shine some light on the amounts of money allocated by the State, the transparency procedures in relation to the allocation of taxpayers' money and whether appropriate financial governance systems are in place to stand up to independent scrutiny; to examine the number of bank accounts in operation within the organisation; to examine the number of company owned credit cards accounted for in audited accounts; and whether there are audited accounts for all bank accounts.
