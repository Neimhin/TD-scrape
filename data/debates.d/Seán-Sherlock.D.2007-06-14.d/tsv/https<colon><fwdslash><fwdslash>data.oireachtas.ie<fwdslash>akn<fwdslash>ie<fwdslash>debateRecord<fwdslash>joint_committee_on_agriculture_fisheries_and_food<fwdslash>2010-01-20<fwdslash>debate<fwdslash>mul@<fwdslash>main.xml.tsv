SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I join in welcoming Animal Health Ireland to the committee.  It is vital that we seek to maintain and improve upon the comparative advantage we hold in terms of beef and livestock exports.  We have a particular comparative advantage.  I am pleased to see the presence of an organisation that is not necessarily a statutory body, but an independent body involving all the stakeholders, including the scientific and commercial sectors, to deal with improving this comparative advantage.  I welcome the work being done.It seems the figure of €500,000 committed by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food over a five-year term, while welcome, appears to be a relatively modest sum, given that disease eradication is very pertinent to the whole issue of improving our export potential.  I hope there will be scope, notwithstanding the current environment, for improvement on that figure to assist AHI with its work.Does AHI agree that perhaps not every primary or livestock producer is adequately au fait with such diseases as BVD and IBR?  There may be a dearth of knowledge in respect of these diseases and more work should be done.  Is there widespread knowledge of all such diseases among livestock holders and primary producers?  We all know about tuberculosis, for example, and we could quote the history, chapter and verse.  Is there adequate knowledge among primary producers?  Will the work of AHI inform their knowledge down the line?  Will a stage be reached whereby every primary producer will know the range of diseases and will be in a position to have indicators for them in place?  I will leave it at that for now.
