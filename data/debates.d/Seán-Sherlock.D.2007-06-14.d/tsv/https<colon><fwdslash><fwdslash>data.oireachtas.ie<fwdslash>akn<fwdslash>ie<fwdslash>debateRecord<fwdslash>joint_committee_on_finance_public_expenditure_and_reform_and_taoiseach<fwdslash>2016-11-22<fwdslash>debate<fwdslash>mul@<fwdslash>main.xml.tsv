[<p eid="para_77">There are some specific questions on the buy-to-let, BTL, field, including No. 6, which is about the short-term solutions being provided, and No. 7 which is about the long-term solutions being provided. First, however, I want to deal with question No. 2, which asked the number of BTL mortgages reported as in arrears greater than 90 days as of 30 June. Since 2013, when the bank cited a figure of 5,000, it now has 2,112 BTL mortgages more than 90 days in arrears. What was the mechanism by which the bank arrived at that number?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">When considering the BTL long-term solutions, Mr. O'Sullivan referred specifically to the reduced payment greater than the interest rate. In fairness to the bank, it has provided all the numbers comprehensively for us, which is to be welcomed. The figure of 1,351 is quoted. If there are 1,351 mortgage holders paying a reduced payment that is greater than the interest rate, wherein lies the risk? This committee is mindful of the tenants of those properties because of the problem of homelessness and if there is 92% performance on the loans, I wonder how those 1,351 will play out. Is there security of tenure? While the bank's first duty is to the mortgage holder, does it feel a social obligation to ensure there are tenants and that they have some security of tenure where those mortgages fail to perform?</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">Specifically on buy-to-let, Mr. O'Sullivan quoted the figure of 423 as the sum total of rent receivers the bank has in place.</p>]
[<p eid="para_84">I would like to get a sense from the witnesses of the fallout from Springboard Mortgages. A total of 1,372 customers of the bank were in line for substantial refunds. I know this was last year, but I would like to get a sense of whether the issue has resolved itself and whether the bank is giving due recognition to its own failings in regard to Springboard, where people lost properties as a result of the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_86">To give a context, it is just the learnings from it to ensure non-repetition of such incidents in the banking sector.</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">Does Mr. Mitchell agree a certain number of these people fell into arrears and lost their homes and were subsequently compensated? How is the bank dealing with these people? Does it have a protocol in place to recognise their loss as a result?</p>]
[<p eid="para_92">What does that mean? It sounds wonderful but what does it mean in real terms, if I may ask?</p>]
[<p eid="para_94">They have not actually been rehoused in some instances as of yet. They have not benefited from-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">I would have closed it out at Mr. Mitchell's last intervention, but Mr. Masding has come back in. To be quite frank about it, I know he must defend his own realm but a great injury was inflicted upon people by the entity before us which we are questioning today. I asked what were the lessons learned in order that we can move on.</p>]
