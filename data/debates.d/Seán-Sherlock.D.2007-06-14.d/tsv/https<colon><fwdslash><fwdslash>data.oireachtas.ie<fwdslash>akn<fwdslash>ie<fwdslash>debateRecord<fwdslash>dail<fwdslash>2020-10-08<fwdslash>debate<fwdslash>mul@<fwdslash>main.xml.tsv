I am speaking specifically in respect of Cork Airport, with which the TÃ¡naiste is familiar. The chief executive officer of Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was in Leinster House yesterday and he stated that Cork has received no direct funding. I am merely asking now if Cork Airport will be able to access regional airport operating expenditure and capital funding so as to ensure it can survive the storm. This is so that when people start flying again, it will have a fighting chance. Cork Airport went from 2.7 million passengers in 2019 to 650,000 passengers this year. If we are speaking about regionally balanced economic policies, we must ensure Cork has a fighting chance in order that when the airlines that have left Cork decide to come back, they will be able to do it through a sustainable operation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-10-08T12:40:00+01:00	Is that a "Yes"? Will we get funding in Cork?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-10-08T12:40:00+01:00	I am taking that as a "Yes".
