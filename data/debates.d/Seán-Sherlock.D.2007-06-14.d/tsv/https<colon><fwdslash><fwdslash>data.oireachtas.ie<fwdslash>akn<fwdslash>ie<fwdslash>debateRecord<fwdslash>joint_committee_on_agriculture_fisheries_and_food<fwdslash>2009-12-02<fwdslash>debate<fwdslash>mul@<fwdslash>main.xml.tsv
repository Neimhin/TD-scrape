[<p eid="para_57">I welcome the representatives from Macra na Feirme and I thank them for their cogent and well thought out presentation.  Mr. Gowing indicated that a grand total of 1,088 students throughout the country are availing of higher education or further education courses provided by Teagasc.  I have a serious reservation about the recruitment embargo and the fact that those retiring from teaching are not being replaced.  This will have a seriously negative effect on the ability to adequately train farmers in the future.</p>, <p eid="para_58">I agree wholeheartedly with what has been put forward by Macra na Feirme in this instance.  The committee should take a strong position on the issue.  In light of the multiplier effect to which Mr. Gowing referred in respect of inputs and investment into the economy and the qualitative nature of teaching and how it has a positive impact on the agriculture sector, any further losses within the academic or teaching coterie will have a detrimental effect.  In such circumstances, the committee should take a strong position and should base this on the figures provided by our guests.</p>, <p eid="para_59">I also have reservations in respect of tax reliefs.  The time is fast approaching when "tax" and "reliefs" will be perceived as dirty words.  It will be impossible to keep such reliefs at the level to which people have become used.  I do not know if it will be possible to reintroduce some of the tax reliefs to which Mr. Gowing referred.  I am interested in the position with regard to stamp duty relief.  Does this primarily benefit those who engage in intrafamilial transfers of property or land or does it affect those who are transferring ownership to third parties?  Are figures available in this regard?  I understand how it provides an incentive and encourages new people to enter farming.  If our guests could provide a further justification of Macra na Feirme's position in respect of this matter, I would welcome it.</p>, <p eid="para_60">What is the position on the rolling reference year in the context of the post-2013 scenario?  I accept that there has been a decrease in the number of farmers under the age of 35 and Mr. Gowing indicated that the figure has fallen from 11% to 7%. The high number of people who transferred into other sectors of employment following decoupling in 2005 might account for this reduction.  However, our guests may have a view that runs contrary to this.</p>, <p eid="para_61">The age barrier should be 40 rather than 35, particularly in light of the transfer of skills into other sectors in the period since decoupling.  There may be many people who went into construction in recent years who are over the age of 35 but still under 40.  These individuals might re-enter farming now and they might be in position to benefit from that relief, if it were retained.  In the context of demographics, I am trying to educate myself with regard to the number of farmers who are under the age of 35.  I accept that percentage figures have been provided but there is no actual number identified.  I am in favour of lifting any barriers to entry for potential new entrants to the sector.  I am not convinced that the age barrier of should be 35.  I would welcome our guests' observations on this.</p>, <p eid="para_62">On carbon sinks, I am interested in the arguments put forward by Mr. Gowing in respect of permanent pasture and forestry.  I do not want to see a situation developing whereby there will be a compromise in respect of production.  We have an extremely good comparative advantage in the production of beef and I do not want this to be adversely affected.  It has already been argued that if beef production here were reduced, desertification would occur in other areas of the world and Ireland would lose its comparative advantage.  On Question Time last week I asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how we would circumvent difficulties relating to production of methane without compromising agricultural production.  A major dilemma exists here and the Minister has yet to provide an adequate response.  I would welcome it if our guests would put forward their views on this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_63">I was impressed by Macra na Feirme's cogent and well put together presentation.  As Deputy Creed said, Macra na Feirme fulfils an important social function.  However, it also retains strong potential in the context of lobbying.  I would like to hear more from our guests on that.  I take issue with them on tax reliefs.  However, I would welcome hearing their counter argument.</p>]
[<p eid="para_86">That is not what I said.  Mr. Gowing may be misinterpreting me slightly.  In the overall context of tax reliefs on property and construction, from a political point of view the idea of applying further reliefs is dirty and that is the context in which I meant it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">I am taken by the idea.  If there were rolling reference years, could external shocks that cause major fluctuations in income lead to a negative situation?  Perhaps I am wrong.  I would like to tease out the matter further with our guests.</p>]
