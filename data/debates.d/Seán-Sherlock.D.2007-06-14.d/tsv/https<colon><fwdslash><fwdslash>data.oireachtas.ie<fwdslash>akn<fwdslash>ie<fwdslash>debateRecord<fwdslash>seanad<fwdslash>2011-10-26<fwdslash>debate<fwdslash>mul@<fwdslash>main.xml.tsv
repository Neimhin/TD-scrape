[<p eid="para_379">I thank the Senator for bringing this project to my attention.  Literacy and numeracy are among the most important life skills taught in schools.  We are determined that no child should leave school without having mastered these skills to the best of his or her abilities.  That is why the Minister, Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn, launched the national literacy strategy on 8 July last.  Ensuring that all young people achieve high standards of literacy and numeracy is one of the key aims of the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister.</p>, <p eid="para_380">The key to the success of the literacy and numeracy strategy will be the engagement of the whole community in ensuring that the strategy is fully implemented.  Developing literacy and numeracy is not the business of schools alone, and families and communities also play a key role by setting high expectations, providing good role models for learners and providing every opportunity for children and young people to become more proficient in literacy and numeracy.  The literacy and numeracy strategy acknowledges the important role that libraries can play in supporting communities, families and young learners to develop better literacy.  Libraries and librarians are an important resource in supporting children's literacy and public library services have been to the fore in promoting reading over many years.  Public libraries enable families to support their children's literacy development through the range of resources and information they make available in a free, open and informal setting.  Whereas libraries are an excellent resource for all families, they can be of particular assistance to families who find it difficult to meet the cost of providing a rich range of books and educational resources in the home.</p>, <p eid="para_381">The project referred to by the Senator, based in the Oranmore branch of County Galway library service to support children in developing their reading skills, is a very fine example of what we have in mind in the literacy strategy.  We compliment the Senator on the leadership and commitment to voluntary effort that she has shown in initiating this project, in organising the participation of children in the workshop and in building fruitful co-operation with the library service.  From what I know of the project, it is an example of a public library putting its resources at the disposal of young learners to give them an opportunity to learn to read and to love to read.  I wholeheartedly compliment the library service on its involvement in this initiative and also the young teachers who are voluntarily giving their time to support the project.</p>, <p eid="para_382">I fully support community-based intervention projects that support literacy and numeracy.  The project gives children the opportunity to select books with expert guidance from professional librarians and the children are assisted in learning to read the books with professional guidance from teachers.  I am delighted to hear from the Senator that she believes it is successful and the Minister has asked the inspectorate of the Department to visit the project in order to provide a detailed report for me on how it works, the profile of children who are involved, the activities organised and the impact that the project is having on children's learning and reading habits.</p>, <p eid="para_383">In the brief time left I should clarify that any accreditation with regard to teaching practice for trainee teachers is a matter for the Teaching Council.  I take on board the Senator's comments regarding lateral thinking being applied to the project, which is to be welcomed.  I contend that if there is a visit by the senior inspectorate, we would proceed from there as such engagement is positive.  It is important to note that the conditions for registration as a teacher are a matter for the Teaching Council, not necessarily the Minister.  The supervisory role relating to teachers in training would be deemed a matter for a school principal.</p>, <p eid="para_384">That is not a negative reply but rather a suggestion that the Senator could have engagement arising from the impending visit by the inspector.  More lateral thinking should also be applied.  I wish the Senator well in the endeavour and we should support it in so far as we are able, although we should be mindful of some of the constraints the Department may be under because of its competence and that of the Teaching Council with initiatives such as this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_386">I take the Senator's point.  The project, by dint of her involvement and active participation, will survive on its own merits.  It will do so owing to the number of stakeholders and the commitment of the people involved.  If there is to be engagement on accreditation, it will solely be a matter for the Teaching Council.  If this could be referred to the inspector in the course of an impending visit, the relevant conversation should take place.  If the Senator made representations to the Teaching Council, which is an independent body, it could be a way of engaging on the subject.</p>]
