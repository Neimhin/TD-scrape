SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-06-13T13:30:00+01:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Dara Murphy. I ask members to please turn off their mobile phones. Will they please switch them to airplane mode? The usual provisos apply. In accordance with the standard procedures agreed to by the Committee on Procedure for paperless committees, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated to members on the document database.  I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-06-13T13:40:00+01:00	The first petition for consideration is petition No. P00023/17 from Ms Judith Clarke and Mr. Shane Dunphy seeking the opening of an autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, unit in all primary and secondary schools. They state that parents often have to bring their children to other counties, towns or locations which are miles away from their homes to access schools with ASD classes. This is the third time we have considered this petition. We propose that the committee forward the response of the Minister for Education and Skills to the petitioners and close the petition. We propose to ask the Department of Education and Skills and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to take account of the recommendations of all three advocacy groups, to whom we have reached out on this issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-06-13T13:40:00+01:00	I thank Deputy Cassells. I call Senator Buttimer.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-06-13T13:40:00+01:00	I thank Senator Buttimer. I call Deputy Murphy.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-06-13T13:50:00+01:00	I appreciate Deputy Eugene Murphy's suggestion and we can liaise with the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to ensure there is no crossover between what we and they do. That is a valid suggestion. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00025/18. This petition objects to abortion on demand and would like to see abortion on demand up to 12 weeks of pregnancy abolished. It is proposed that the committee deem the petition to be inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1) (a). Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration is petition No. P00010/18. This petition concerns the consolidation of statutory instruments instead of amending them. The petitioner proposes that consolidating statutory instruments would be publicly beneficial as it would make laws more accessible and transparent to all and could result in the reduction of legal fees. It is proposed that the committee would close the petition, forward a copy of the responses from the Office of the Attorney General and the Law Reform Commission to the petitioner and inform the petitioner of the upcoming report by the Law Reform Commission on this issue. Is that agreed? Agreed.
