[<p eid="para_185">I join in welcoming the witnesses this morning. I have a short time so if I can have a rapid fire round of questions, I would be grateful for that opportunity. Where stands the conversation with the Government about the resumption of point-to-point racing? Mr. Kavanagh has previously made the point about running meetings on racecourses. I speak specifically for Cork. I do not think it would be practical to run Kildorrery, Killeagh or Dromahane point-to-point meetings in Mallow racecourse at this point in time. Mr. Kavanagh might have a view on that. We would like to see a resumption of point-to-point races in their natural state in the locations that the many people who go to point-to-point races would normally visit. In the absence of people being able to go to point-to-point races, can these races be run in original locations like Kildorrery or Dromahane? How soon will that happen?</p>]
[<p eid="para_189">On remuneration, am I given to understand that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been notified of the remuneration of all persons employed by HRI or its subsidiaries?</p>]
[<p eid="para_191">In essence, while Mr. Kavanagh is saying a derogation has been sought — I refer specifically to there being a conflict between the derogation and GDPR requirements in respect of readily identifiable persons, to use Mr. Kavanagh’s phrase — is the information on the remuneration of the relevant person or all persons still held with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine? I want to be very clear about this. If we cannot get the information from HRI directly, can this committee, in this era of transparency, seek it directly from the Department? Where an individual is serving on a State body, is a member of a board or holds an executive position, and where significant amounts of taxpayers’ money are being given to the board or organisation in question, the least we should expect is the notification of the remuneration package. I do not believe it is fair to say the information is commercially sensitive because HRI is, de facto, operating a monopoly in respect of the horse racing industry in Ireland. Does Mr. Kavanagh agree?</p>]
[<p eid="para_193">I thank Mr. Kavanagh. My last point is on third party events held at HRI venues, such as Mallow racecourse. I still call it Mallow racecourse because I am a proud Mallowman. HRI calls it Cork Racecourse Mallow. There is a fair at the racecourse, a home and garden fair. Is it anticipated that third-party events such as that will continue or will be pencilled into the calendar? I would imagine such events provide vital revenue streams for HRI and the individual racecourses, but they are also vital to the non-horse fraternity or confraternity. I want to make sure there is proactive engagement to ensure as many people as possible can enjoy the venues and the events held in them. I am putting my hand up for the garden fair that takes place in Mallow every year. Can we expect the resumption of events like that in the not-too-distant future, subject to public health guidelines?</p>]
