SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-26T19:40:00+01:00	I support the motion. I want to focus on one aspect of the issue relating to the submission made by Family Carers Ireland, FCI, in respect of the transport and mobility scheme. The mobility allowance and motorised transport grant was withdrawn in 2013. I quote from a very sensible submission it made, which states:The failure to replace the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Schemes, withdrawn in 2013 on the grounds of age discrimination, has led to the illogical situation whereby those who received a Mobility Allowance prior to 2013 have been allowed to keep it while others now equally in need are locked out. It also means that the only transport support available is the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme, which is targeted only at those with severe physical disabilities, with no support available to those with an intellectual disability.This prioritises the needs of people with physical disabilities over those with an intellectual disability and is subject to legal challenge. That sums up the issue. I am Chairman of the Committee on Public Petitions. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has responsibility for disabilities, appeared before the committee in October 2017. At that stage he was promising a transport scheme. Last year in May 2018, a memorandum was brought to the Government on the same issue with proposals for a transport-support payment scheme which did not seem to pass muster at the Cabinet and they were asked to go away and look at the issue again. In January 2019 the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, stated:I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris on the best way to progress the Transport Scheme.I do not understand the role of the Minister of State in the Government. I know what his title is but I feel strongly that he has delivered absolutely nothing for the people he is supposed to serve. This is a typical example of a Government kicking to touch an issue it promised to legislate and provide for. It is a very specific issue but it affects people in a complex way.  The spirit of this motion from our party reflects a sensible set of recommendations from Family Carers Ireland. If the Minister of State gives the excuse that there are little or no resources, we will take that with a pinch of salt. The rainy day fund is an example of that. Money can be found for that particular scheme to ensure that those in need are provided for. It would not take a pile of money to do this, given that on numerous occasions, including at Cabinet meetings, the Minister of State has said that he would provide for the replacement of the 2013 scheme. In my short submission, I call on him to deliver on his promise. When it comes to this agenda, the Minister of State has disappeared. He is kicking everything to touch. I could go on and on about the families I deal with on a daily basis and their sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities who cannot access even a night of respite. As Deputies, we have had conversations with the CEOs of the service providers and then have gone back to the HSE and the Government but we cannot get honest, decent answers to the questions we put forward. All we want is to represent the people who elected us. All they are asking for, on behalf of their families, is the dignity of being able to access respite care for their loved ones. The Minister of State has gone to ground and I fail to understand it. The Labour Party made decisions in government and we paid a price for it but this is a time of relative plenty; the resources are there. I understand the Government has to make provision for things such as Brexit but I do not understand why, in the times in which we live, we cannot provide for those who do not have a strong voice for themselves.
