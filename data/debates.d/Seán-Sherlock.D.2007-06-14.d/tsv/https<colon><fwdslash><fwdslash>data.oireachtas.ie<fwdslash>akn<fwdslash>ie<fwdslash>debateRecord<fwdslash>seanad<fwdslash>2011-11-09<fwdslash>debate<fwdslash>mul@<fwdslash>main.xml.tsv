SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Access to certain social insurance payments, which are based on PRSI contributions, differ between employees and the self-employed.  While employees and the self-employed are liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of employees, bringing the PRSI payment in respect of employees to a combined 14.75% rate per employee under the full class A rate.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits based on the higher level of contribution.  Class S self-employed contributions provide cover for long-term benefits, such as the State contributory pension, widow's or widower's pension or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.I am keenly aware of the very difficult financial position self-employed people are now in.  We have all heard cases in our clinics and advice centres, in particular small business owners who find themselves in a very precarious financial position.  However, we have to strike a balance between contributions made and benefits received.  PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people.A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within the social insurance context, such as this, is common in other European social protection systems.  In this context, it should be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared with employees.  The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found it favours the self-employed over the employed when employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person.For example, a male married self-employed contributor earning gross average industrial wages had a value for money index of 10.3 compared with an index of 3.1 for an equivalent employee.  In basic terms this means that, with regard to benefits, the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over ten times what he or she contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who, even with access to a broader range of benefits, only gets three times what he or she and his or her employer contributes.The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can gain substantially more from the fund than employees.  It should be noted that the State contributory pension increased in excess of inflation and earnings growth in the period up to 2010 while annuities offer CPI linked increases at best.  The market cost of an inflation linked annuity with €12,000 a year in initial benefits is in excess of €300,000, without any associated survivor's benefits.Any changes to the PRSI system in order to provide access to short-term benefits such as social insurance illness-related benefits would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, established the advisory group on tax and social welfare earlier this year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.  It will examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether it is technically feasible and financially sustainable.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am happy to make a submission in light of the concerns raised.  The State has to be mindful of the cost of implementing such a scheme, in terms of deriving short-term benefits.  I take the point made on the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  I will refer the matter to the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I respectfully suggest the Senator engage with the Minister. The Senator referred to a specific case in her constituency.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I respectfully suggest that as the Senator has raised this matter on the Adjournment if she were to raise it again with the Minister she would respond.  I will notify the Minister that it has been raised on the Adjournment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The national strategy for higher education to 2030, otherwise known as the Hunt report, lays out a clear possible development pathway for amalgamated institutes of technology, which meet specified performance criteria, to seek redesignation as technological universities.A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.Following publication of the higher education strategy, the Department commissioned input from an international expert, familiar with the Irish higher education sector, on the detailed performance criteria against which any future applications for redesignation as a technological university would be assessed.  In its statutory advisory capacity, the Minister then asked the Higher Education Authority for its formal advice on final appropriate performance criteria.  A consultation process on draft criteria has been undertaken by the HEA and it is understood that the HEA hopes to sign off its formal advice to the Minister at a meeting of the authority later this month.  Following consideration of this, the Minister aims to be in a position to publish the designation criteria and the process arrangements before the end of December.The establishment of a technological university will also require legislation and this will be advanced as part of the overall work programme for implementation of the higher education strategy.  However, the first step is to provide clarity on the performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  It is important to repeat that it has to be done in an informed and balanced way.  It would not be right to designate a particular structure as a technological university at this stage, it must go through a proper academic and formal consultation process while retaining the need to ensure the commitment is maintained.Any decision must be made on the basis of sound academic and performance-related criteria.  The first step is to provide clarity on those performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  Once a process is in place, it will be open to institutes of technology to come together to make applications for consideration for redesignation.  That is an eminently sensible approach.  All applications, including any involving Waterford Institute of Technology, will be considered under an independent assessment process.  This is a necessary prerequisite of upholding the quality and international reputation of the higher education system.There is a clear understanding, on a cross-party political basis, of the need to ensure there is balanced regional development, as referred to by Senator Cullinane.  I acknowledged during a recent visit to Waterford Institute of Technology, including the TSSG centre, that world-class research is being carried out there.  It is an exceptional entity of which people in the Waterford region can be very proud.  The capability and capacity are there, but we must go through a process.  Moreover, it must be a logical and informed process rather than a knee-jerk reaction which could create an entity that is not self-sustaining.  We must ensure that whatever is created can sustain itself and compete with other institutions.  We should also take into account that there are as many students on the campus of Stanford University in California as there are in third level institutions throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  We must think relatively and be careful of how we proceed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I acknowledge the legitimate concerns expressed by the Senator.  The institute of technology sector of itself is very much engaged on those points, particularly in regard to the humanities and the social sciences side as they pertain to the sector.  I am also confident those questions have arisen in the context of deliberations on the Hunt report.  Nevertheless, I will convey the concerns outlined by the Senator directly to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.
