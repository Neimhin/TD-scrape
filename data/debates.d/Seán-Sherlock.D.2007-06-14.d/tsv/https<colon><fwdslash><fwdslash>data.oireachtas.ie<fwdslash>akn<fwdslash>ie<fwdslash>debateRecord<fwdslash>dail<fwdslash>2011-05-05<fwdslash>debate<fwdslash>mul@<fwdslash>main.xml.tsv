SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I assure the Deputy and this House that since assuming office I have incorporated a strong focus on our research and development strengths and incentives in my engagement with Government and business abroad, and with overseas governments and business presences in this country and I will continue to do so.I engaged with Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn recently when I met with her at the recent Council of Ministers meeting in Budapest.  I signalled to her this country's strong intention of seeking to ensure that we can draw down the maximum amount and hit the target of €600 million under the current framework programme 7 and that we would endeavour to surpass that target if we could but, furthermore and more importantly, that we would engage deeply with her on the next framework programme which we feel would ensure that we can continue on the programme for research and development in this country in order to ensure that the research engine keeps going and we can build on that.I do not know how much time I have.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	In establishing the itinerary for any official visits abroad, the three State enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, work very closely together, with my own Department and with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The objective is clear: we want to achieve increased sales and exports and to headline our attractiveness as a locale for FDI.  This entails setting out our stall not only on the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the research and development tax credit but also on our intellectual capital and other attractions and in restoring reputational damage in that regard also.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Ireland's ongoing development as a centre for research excellence continues to be a crucial factor in the attraction of foreign direct investment and SFI serves as a magnet of attraction for FDI through its support of research expertise in ICT, biotechnology and energy, its 341 principal investigator teams, its partnership with FDI and Irish companies in the nine centres for science, engineering and technology, CSETs, and the 19 strategic research centres, SRCs.As the agency tasked with attracting industrial FDI to Ireland, IDA Ireland approved 126 investment projects for support in 2010, including 37 research, development and innovation projects, where IDA support underpinned total RDI investment of approximately €465 million.Given the small size of the Irish economy, increased sales will be largely achieved overseas through exporting.  Enterprise Ireland is therefore focused on every aspect of the exporting and trade development process and the promotion of Irish companies on overseas trade visits is a key part of this process.  Overseas visits present an opportunity to build awareness among the international community of the availability of sophisticated products and services emerging from innovation and research and development within indigenous industry.We have other strengths, complementary to our fiscal regime and intellectual capital.  The availability of qualified labour, a workforce noted among peers internationally for its flexibility and adaptability and falling costs in terms of property, workforce and energy.  Our task, working together with the relevant Departments and agencies, is to marshal all of these strengths to deliver a positive outcome.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	On the first part of the question, as the Deputy is well aware the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already visited India and a further visit to the United States is envisaged some time during the summer.  The Deputy will also be aware that the President has visited The Netherlands.  Part of that process involved engaging on the European Space Agency, ESA, programme in which six Irish companies are already involved.An internal engagement in ongoing on the content services centre.  We do not have definitive timelines at this stage but there is a very clear direction within the programme for Government that we would build on the existing centres of excellence and create three additional competence centres.  That engagement is currently ongoing.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy on the matter, as I would be with any Member of the House, because it is in the national interest that we continue to ensure we can build on the €600 million that is invested in research and development in this country.The research and STI programme will be vital in order to ensure that companies already in this country which are based on the FDI model stay here and that we can build and add to what exists.  That is why the budget lines are vital.  I will revert to the Deputy on the matter.  I thank him sincerely for his kind remarks.
