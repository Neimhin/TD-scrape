SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome Mr. Guiomard's informative contribution.  The aviation industry faces major challenges.  The commissioner referred to a reassessment of current regulatory structures.  Will he flesh out this comments?I have a particular interest in the regional imbalance.  Dublin Airport is increasingly becoming a bottleneck and one has little joy in using the facility.  There appears to be a perceptible diminution in the role of Cork and Shannon airports which have lost slots or had certain slots changed.  Does the Commission for Aviation Regulation have a role to play in addressing this imbalance or at least in seeking to encourage the use of slots beyond Dublin Airport and in the regions?I am surprised, given the number of passengers who use Irish airports annually, that only two people deal with the rights of passengers, although I am open to correction on this.  We have all subscribed in our habits to the low cost airline culture in that we engage in a contract with a low cost airline and are at its mercy and whims.  One pays one fee, boards the flight and the devil takes the hindmost.  Is there a case for increasing the rights of passengers?  Does the current regime give proper and due recognition to the rights of passengers when delays occur or in terms of baggage charges and the application of more stringent rules by all airlines?  Does the commission have a role in this regard?  Should the joint committee make a case to the powers that be, namely, the Minister, that increased funding should be made available to employ more personnel to deal with the rights of passengers?On slots, while it is important to protect the national interest, if we all subscribe to a market philosophy, airlines will find their own market.  As an island nation, however, can a case be made for protecting certain slots?  The loss of the Aer Lingus slots at Shannon Airport recently was a debacle.  Given that London is a major hub and the Shannon region is a major economic hub, one could argue that the change of the slot resulted in a serious loss of comparative advantage for the region.  Does the commission have a role in the context of our pursuit of a balanced regional economic policy aimed at preventing all investment going to the Pale?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Jacob's report published in 2006 analysed the capacity.  Is a different picture emerging for Dublin?  Is the commissioner satisfied that projected capacity is adequate for five or ten years hence?  I do not have an economic analysis to hand but common sense suggests that airline traffic will grow unbelievably.  Will the commissioner seek a further expansion?  I appreciate the commissioner's remarks about his responsibilities in respect of regional policy, but people will ask this question.The commissioner's staff of 21, with four economists and two legal people, seems minuscule given the size and volume of the industry and that we live in a litigious environment.  Will the commissioner elaborate a little on the nature of the litigation?  Could it be argued that the aviation regulator will spend a great deal of time and resources, unfairly perhaps, staving off challenges from various airlines and that the Government must consider this in respect of funding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak again.  I am learning as I go.  When companies are litigious the regulator has to use resources on going into court every other day, which is a cost burden.  It affects how one defends the rights of passengers.  It diminishes the commission's role in defending passengers because it cannot expend resources in that regard.In its submission the commission referred to alternative arrangements which would have the impact of a judicial judgment but in a non-judicial setting.  What role is envisaged for legislators in that regard?I am tired of reading newspaper headlines of airlines taking challenges every other day of the week.  I wonder if it really is for the common good.  I can understand a company trying to protect a competitive advantage which is sound economics, but we must be cognisant of the rights of passengers.
