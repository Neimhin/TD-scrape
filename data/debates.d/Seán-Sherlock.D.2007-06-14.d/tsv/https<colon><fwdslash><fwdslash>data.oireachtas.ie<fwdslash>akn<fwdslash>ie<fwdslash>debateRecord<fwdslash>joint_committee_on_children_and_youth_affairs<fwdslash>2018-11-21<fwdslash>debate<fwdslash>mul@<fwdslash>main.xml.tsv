SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:10:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister here today. She has given us some very devastating news based on what she heard late last night. We heard that there are 71 alleged abusers historically and 108 survivors that we know about. It is pertinent for us to empathise with the fact that there are potentially more than 108 people out there who are potentially traumatised by their experiences. When Mr. Elliott came before us on 9 May he gave an undertaking that he would look at the historical cases pre-2003 and the review has come up with that devastating news. In light of this news very late last night I want to get an understanding of the Minister's interaction with the new board in terms of how she and the Department will deal with it. Is it the case that all bets are now off regarding future funding until such time as the situation is clarified and rectified? Notwithstanding what I have said, I should add a proviso to the effect that 99.9% of those involved in Scouting Ireland are honest, decent volunteers who are doing an excellent job and will be devastated by the news. They will be traumatised by this as well and they will want the funding to continue. How do we find a mechanism to ensure that scouting continues and that the new board, which we wish well and which has been given a clean slate, can operate and that we find a mechanism to deal with the historical issues and also ensure that scouting can continue safely and without any cloud hanging over it? The Minister's human response will perhaps give some solace to people who are honest and decent and who constitute the vast majority of scouters, their parents and friends. We need to hear from her on how it is intended to deal with the issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:10:00+00:00	A lot of our focus in the main meeting of the committee was on the barrister's report on the alleged event that took place in 2009. This new information is shocking.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:10:00+00:00	I am viscerally shocked by the information we have received today. I want to get clarity in my own mind that the Minister is satisfied that those files have now been sent to the Garda. Given that the Minister only received the information late last night I would like to know what has occurred, procedurally, in the less than 12 hours or so since she has been in receipt of the information. I am sure we will have an opportunity to speak to the board in respect of its handling of the issue but I wish to get the Minister's perspective.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:30:00+00:00	If the Minister is telling us there are 71 alleged abusers and that there are 108 victims, is it fair to assume it is only a sample? I am making that assumption and I could be wrong. I would like to be corrected or educated on whether that is the case. If it is only a sample, the question then arises as to whether the Minister or Department has been informed about whether this is representative of a much larger figure that is under investigation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:30:00+00:00	To try to assist my understanding of this, is it safe to assume that in Larch Hill, there are a number of files in addition to the numbers we are talking about here today?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T10:30:00+00:00	It is pertinent to this because what it means is that what the Minister is presenting us with today - to speak to the Minister's bona fides - is that the figures she has articulated to us are exactly the number articulated to her as Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:20:00+00:00	We have made a great deal of progress since the witnesses' appearance in May. At that point, there was much that we did not know.Mr. Elliot had said at that stage that records were "kept securely in fireproof filing cabinets in Larch Hill" and the Garda and Tusla had been informed about that. We are a number of months on in the process and we have a picture of the number of alleged abusers. We may not have been presented with a finite number but we understand that it is an iterative ongoing process and that the number of victims may increase as well. As he said, in the case of one or more alleged perpetrators there are no files.  I am satisfied as to the openness of Scouting Ireland's engagement with us today in ensuring that there is confidence on the part of Members present but, most important, on the part of the ordinary decent people who give of their time every day to the organisation and those who fund the organisation, namely the taxpayers. Notwithstanding the devastating numbers of people who are survivors or victims, some of whom are deceased, we cannot even imagine on a human level what the survivors are going through at present. It is unconscionable. We have to have some confidence in the fact that the organisation is now, to use its own phrase, "taking ownership" of the issue and that they are putting in place a victims policy. That certainly gives me some confidence. Is Scouting Ireland making a financial contingency on its books for a number of cases where the DPP decides that there is a nolle prosequi with some cases because of insufficient evidence? I do not want to presume the outcome here but, for example, there was a recognition in the Cloyne diocesan investigation where certain cases came before the court with the same modus operandi that on the balance of probabilities etc. that there was enough proof, notwithstanding the lack of proof in the book of evidence, and that there should be some form of compensation. Is the new board discussing those issues? I do not expect the board to say that it is but I want this issue on the agenda to get some sense from the organisation that it is dealing with that issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	There are precedents in cases brought to the DPP where nolle prosequi was the determination of that office but there was an acknowledgement by the organisation that abuse took place. Is Scouting Ireland discussing the possibility that some fund will be made available for financial compensation or for services to be wrapped around the person in question?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	Is litigation outstanding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	Can Ms Kelly say how many cases are outstanding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	But Ms Kelly acknowledges that there are cases outstanding specifically in respect of alleged abuse.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	I would like further engagement with the committee regarding progress on those matters. The second issue is the complaints policy. Ms Kelly's intervention deals with three thematic areas: safeguarding; accountability and disciplinary policy. As a member of this committee, I wish the new board well. The mood music has changed on ensuring that there is a new transparency in how matters are dealt with. The new board has received a strong mandate from the individual members of the scouting organisation. When it comes to a new disciplinary policy, am I correct that the organisation has engaged an employment lawyer who has externally reviewed the policies, and that it has adopted new procedures since 18 November?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	If there are complaints then, for instance, by a senior member of the organisation against an individual, which were registered prior to that, what is the status of those complaints now?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:30:00+00:00	It does but only to a certain point, because I am in receipt of correspondence about individuals. There are outstanding issues that I want to deal with. There is, for instance, a complaint against an individual who is now the subject of a disciplinary procedure because he was critical of a senior officer within the organisation. There are allegations against the complainant by a senior officer of the organisation, who has stated in a letter that the complainant has actively supported criticism of him and of his performance of his duties and has called for his resignation. The person who called for the resignation of the senior person is now being brought in front of Scouting Ireland under page 11 of the disputes and adults policy, etc. When we are members of organisations and put our heads out there, it is likely that people will criticise us. There is a fine line between criticism and something that is actionable or subject to a disciplinary procedure. Has the new board examined whether the four live complaints will proceed? Have they the support of the board?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:40:00+00:00	I am keen to understand the new structures. The voluntary board is disaggregating itself from the procedures. Is that correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:40:00+00:00	I am suggesting now that this will become a live issue if there are four live complaints. It is something that Ms Kelly, as chairperson, should have cognisance of in respect of the nature of the complaints. That is all I am saying. I am keen to keep this in a positive vein. Again, I thank the representatives of Scouting Ireland for coming before the committee. We have a clear sense and understanding now of where Scouting Ireland is going, and that is important. I wish to ask about the advertising of the safeguarding manager position. Ms Kelly said the safeguarding manager was advertised in the national and international press. When was that exactly?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T11:40:00+00:00	Scouting Ireland representatives were before the committee in May. In the time since then, was it the position of the board that Scouting Ireland would have an interim position with Mr. Elliot in place and then move to advertising?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	Is Ms Kelly referring to the barrister's report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	As laypersons looking in on Scouting Ireland, we all want to give the organisation a fair wind. However, in the answers being given today I am hearing that the organisation will decide if and when the barrister's report will be published. I want to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and I believe we need to hear something stronger to assure us that there is full transparency around the report. I do not get a sense of that at the moment, on account of the time that has passed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	On the disciplinary procedures, I am very heartened to hear that the organisation has brought in an external lawyer with expertise in the area of employment and labour law. However, I and others are in possession of letters about complaints made against individuals. I accept Ms Kelly's statement that there is a disaggregation between her role as a volunteer and as a member of the executive but if she is aware that there are four live complaints, I assume she is aware of the nature and content of those complaints.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	I am discussing policies and procedures. A submission was before us-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	There is correspondence and we are told a new policy is in place for disciplinary procedures, which was agreed on 18 November. Disciplinary letters were issued prior to that, the content of which I have not gone into. I am trying to ascertain whether the new board had regard to those letters when it was considering the new policy which was agreed on 18 November. In other words, does the new board stand over the letters that were issued and the policy around them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:00:00+00:00	I thank Ms Kelly for her frankness, which is refreshing. There needs to be a clear demarcation between roles and everything should be upfront. A person who is listening to this meeting and who may be the subject of a complaint will know that there is a policy and procedures for how the complaint is dealt with. I wish the new board well. There will be a role for us in seeking to examine how the transition between the old and new boards progresses. Mr. Elliott was very honest with us on the challenges he found and I imagine that the new board will have to challenge a pre-existing culture. I am not saying there is a black mark against existing cultures but one has to let in the light and certain people might not be favour of that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	Who is the current national secretary of Scouting Ireland?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	If a disciplinary proceeding was issued under the signature of the national secretary in October, what is the status of that if the association is wound down?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	On 1 October.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	The policies have remained the same.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	How?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	To be straight about it, will Ms Kelly indicate what the status of a complaint is if a letter was issued on 1 October by an Accounting Officer, in Civil Service parlance, or a paid official, and if it involves disciplinary proceedings against an individual?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	Of the association.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	For which the new board has no oversight.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	It is my intention to pursue, in so far as I can, while I have a mandate here, natural justice in respect of any complaints that are made. I have an obligation to certain people who have approached me to ensure-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-21T12:10:00+00:00	-----it is followed through to the letter of the law.
