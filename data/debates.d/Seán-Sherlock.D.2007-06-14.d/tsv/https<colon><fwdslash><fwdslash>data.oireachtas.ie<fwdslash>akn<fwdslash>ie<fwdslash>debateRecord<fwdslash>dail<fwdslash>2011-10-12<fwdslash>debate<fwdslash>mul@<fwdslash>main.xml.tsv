[<p eid="para_696">The programme for Government sets out clearly that Ireland's economic recovery must be export-led and commits us to achieving the maximum growth in exports.  Enterprise Ireland will spearhead this work.</p>, <p eid="para_697">A potential exporters' unit is currently being operationalised in Enterprise Ireland.  It will offer a new service delivery and model of engagement for new and existing client companies.  Along with the provision of business-related toolkits, including export toolkits which will be delivered in part on-line, the division will provide tailored export capability building workshops, modules and programmes for companies entering new markets as well as access to mentors.  A new series of guides to markets is also being introduced with a focus on practical information aimed at new exporters.  This will be available even to companies who do not meet Enterprise Ireland's normal employment test of having at least ten employees.  The intention is to widen the range of companies which can graduate to other established programmes focused on exporting opportunities.</p>, <p eid="para_698">Such programmes are tailored to a company's stage of export development.  They include the international selling programme and the excel at export selling workshop series as well as first flight workshops and mentor services.  As well as training programmes, Enterprise Ireland helps companies retain the services of industry experts to support market expansion and development.  The going global fund also supports established but domestically-focussed companies to explore opportunities on the international market.  Through its client knowledge services offer, Enterprise Ireland allows client companies and potential exporters access to a comprehensive library of sector and market intelligence and information on doing business overseas.  Enterprise Ireland has also developed detailed third-party legal and tax contacts in priority markets which can be accessed by new exporters, as well as organising and engaging business networks in all markets wherever possible.  It recently launched the second call of its very successful graduates 4 international growth programme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_700">Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated high growth markets unit in Dublin to provide further assistance to client companies doing business in a range of countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Trade missions support this work.  Under the programme for Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has taken particular responsibility for trade promotion.  This means the diplomatic service is fully engaged in promoting trade and plans have been developed for each of Ireland's target markets.  The Tánaiste chairs the new export council which brings together the focus of this work.</p>, <p eid="para_701">The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is engaged in developing trading opportunities in emerging economies through the negotiation of free-trade agreements between the EU and third countries and improved opportunities for exporters can also emerge from reductions in tariff and non-tariff barriers through trade and regulatory discussions between the EU and China, Russia and Brazil.</p>, <p eid="para_702">To answer the question, it is an ongoing process and one must speak to the figures.  Between 2004 and 2010, merchandise exports from Ireland to Brazil, Russia, India and China rose by approximately 122% and in the same period services exports to those countries rose by688%.  Another key example of this success is the fact that Ireland now has a significant trade surplus with China, which is a dramatic turnaround from the position only four years previously when we had a deficit of approximately €2.9 billion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_705">I understand that for the year to date exports have increased by approximately 6%——</p>]
[<p eid="para_707">The overall year to date figures show an increase from last year and exports from indigenous industries have increased by approximately 10%.  The omens are good on the export side.  The creation of the export trade council, which arises from the trade, tourism and investment strategy, signals a clear intention by the Government, as per the programme for Government, to drive exports even further in the countries I mentioned earlier.  The new council's membership includes the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and senior representatives from the relevant agencies and Departments.  This derives from a previous policy which was borne out of common sense and will continue.  There is greater emphasis, and the figures bear this out, to drive exports in the so-called BRIC countries.</p>]
[<p eid="para_744">On 29 September last, the establishment of NewERA was announced by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Minister of State Fergus O'Dowd, who has special responsibility for NewERA.  The Government took the decision to establish NewERA to reform the manner in which Government manages its shareholding in the semi-State companies.  It is one of the key commitments in the programme for Government and is central to our plans for investment.</p>, <p eid="para_745">NewERA will initially be established on a non-statutory basis as a shareholder executive within the NTMA.  It will have responsibility for reviewing capital investment plans of the commercial semi-State companies from a shareholder perspective and will identify possible synergies between investment programmes of different State companies.  The companies in question are the ESB, Bord Gáis, EirGrid, Bord na Móna and Coillte.</p>, <p eid="para_746">The decision to establish NewERA is an important element in the Government's strategy to create jobs and promote economic growth.  The operation of NewERA will be overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure, of which the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is a member.</p>, <p eid="para_747">The Government is doing everything it can to create jobs and improve Irish infrastructure.  Part of this is to ensure that critical infrastructure is put in place to allow enterprise to grow now and in the future and take advantage of the opportunities which arise in traditional and emerging sectors.</p>]
[<p eid="para_750">The fact that Deputy Fergus O'Dowd is the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA is incidental in terms of this being a whole Government approach to the issue.  We should not underestimate the fact that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is on the Cabinet sub-committee.  There is a corporate view at Government level between the two parties of Government of the need to ensure we have an entity that will carry out a corporate governance function from a shareholder perspective and that will report to the relevant Ministers and be overseen by the Cabinet committee on economic infrastructure.  The bottom line is that it is a whole of Government approach.  Through NewERA, the Government is taking control of the infrastructure as per the semi-State companies involved.</p>, <p eid="para_751">Regarding the second part of the question on the jobs target, the key emphasis is to ensure we get it up and running.  We must get the key strategic infrastructure fund in place through the NPRF and we must become more efficient in terms of how we run these companies.  Infrastructure is the key at this point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_753">There is a commitment in line with obligations to the troika in respect of non-strategic State assets.  Deputy O'Dea is aware of why we are in that position.  The key issue is that, following the appropriate legislative changes, resources will be channelled from the NPRF to productive investment.  We are talking about productive investment in the Irish economy.  I realise there may not be a specific target of a number of jobs.  Although one of the parties in government set out a specific target as part of its manifesto, there is a programme for Government and a clear convergence in terms of what both parties are trying to achieve.  We must be mindful of targets and ensure we have an efficient organisation in NewERA to manage infrastructure and investment in partnership with the NPRF, using the strategic infrastructure fund, which will be the forerunner to the strategic infrastructure bank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_755">Discussions with the troika are ongoing this week in respect of the issue.  We are ensuring that we can leverage State assets to create jobs.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has a political philosophical view on selling State assets that must be respected but there is a process of engagement with the troika in which commitments are given by this Government, which is sovereign.  We are not going to disavow those commitments but, as a Government, we are in the business of seeking to ensure we can get out of this economic morass.  The sale of State assets is one mechanism by which we can do this.  We want to create an efficient tool called NewERA so we can ensure that we can leverage the assets to create jobs.  I cannot give an exact answer of pounds, shillings and pence for the number of jobs we can create.</p>]
[<p eid="para_757">The assets will be used in a way that seeks to leverage them to create jobs and we have not maximised the potential of those State assets heretofore.</p>]
[<p eid="para_788">My Department recently carried out a public consultation in regard to this matter.  The consultation document set out the background to the matter arising from the judgment issued by Mr. Justice Charleton in the High Court in the case of EMI Records (Ireland) Limited and others <i>v</i>. UPC Communications Ireland Limited.  It indicated that it had been considered heretofore that injunctions, as required under Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, known as the copyright or info soc directive, were already available in Irish law under subsection 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.</p>, <p eid="para_789">However, in the judgment referred to, Mr. Justice Charleton held that he was constrained by the wording of the 2000 Act and could not grant an injunction, as sought, in regard to infringement of copyright against an information service provider in the circumstances of "mere conduit", as set out in the EU e-commerce directive, 2000/31/EC.  Accordingly, and for the avoidance of doubt, the consultation document indicated that it was considered necessary to restate Ireland's compliance with the directives concerned.  In proposing to do so, it was pointed out that the Department was particularly conscious of the importance of online content and digital businesses in the Irish context and that, accordingly, it was simply seeking to ensure Ireland's continued compliance with its obligations under the relevant EU directives, following the decision of the High Court in the aforementioned UPC case.</p>, <p eid="para_790">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>, <p eid="para_791">The consultation document also contained the text of a proposal to amend the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, by means of a statutory instrument under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, which had been drawn up after careful consideration and in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  Arising from the public consultation, more than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  Several of these submissions contained legal argument in regard to the issue, including, in at least one case, advice of senior counsel, as well as detailed comments in respect of the draft statutory instrument which was published as part of the consultation process.  These comments are being considered by my Department in conjunction with its legal adviser and the Attorney General's office.</p>]
[<p eid="para_793">I will not be held to a timetable because I want to give this matter the fullest consideration.  There is more work to be done between my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Given that I have been in office only since March, I reserve the right to take more time on this issue.  I do not accept the argument that there are jobs at stake.  It is an issue on which there is an interaction between rights holders, the "mere conduits" — that is, the Internet service providers, ISPs — and the end users, of whom there are millions.  We must ensure that we get the balance right and that the legislation is correct.  I am conscious of the Deputy's point regarding the gaming industry and Xtra-vision, but I intend to make haste slowly on this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_795">I would be happy to meet all stakeholders on this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_796">Written Answers follow Adjournment.</p>]
