[<p eid="para_48">Deputy Brian Hayes has covered the questions fairly comprehensively.  My first question is on subhead B2.  If the charge for the school transport scheme has increased from €75 to €300 per pupil, with a maximum of €650 per family, how much does the Department hope to yield?  Is the amount over and above the increase of €10.5 million which the Department seeks for costs associated with increasing demand?</p>, <p eid="para_49">Is the Department seeking an increase under C4 for special needs assistants alone?  There are major problems for caretakers and secretaries with pension provision and I understand the Department of Finance dragged its feet on the issue as it waited for the latest social partnership agreement to be ratified.  Now that the agreement has been ratified, will any of this increase be used to solve some of those problems?</p>, <p eid="para_50">My second question relates to the strategic innovation fund, subhead E5, and research and development, E13.  Is the Minister saying there has been a decline in applications for the strategic innovation fund?  He says an amount of €27 million is not required in 2008, mainly due to the slower than profiled progress on the part of institutions.  I do not know what that phrase means in layman's terms but I would guess the amount allocated was not taken up or is being stretched from 2008 into 2009.  The Minister might clarify that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_67">To what does the Minister attribute the significant year-on-year reductions in the average award?</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">Is that more aspirational than factual?  There has to be a reason for the decrease.  I do not mean to sound facetious.</p>]
