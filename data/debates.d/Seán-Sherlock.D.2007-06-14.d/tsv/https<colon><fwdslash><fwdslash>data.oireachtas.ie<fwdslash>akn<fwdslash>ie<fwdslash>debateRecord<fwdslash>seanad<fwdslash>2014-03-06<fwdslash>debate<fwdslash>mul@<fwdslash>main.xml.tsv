[<p eid="para_111">The amendments to section 8 and section 12 were agreed on Committee Stage in the Dáil on 18 February. I thank Members of this House for their prompt consideration of the Bill so soon after that date. Both amendments relate to the superannuation benefits of the existing pensioners of the county enterprise boards and the schemes themselves.</p>, <p eid="para_112"> Sections 12(1) to 12(3), inclusive, provide for Forfás, Enterprise Ireland or a local authority to accept staff into their employment who were previously employed by a county enterprise board on terms and conditions no less favourable in relation to remuneration. Current employees of the county enterprise boards will, upon dissolution, become members of the Forfás superannuation scheme, the Enterprise Ireland superannuation scheme or a local authority superannuation scheme as appropriate. This is provided for in section 12(5)(a). It provides for their entitlement to superannuation - pension benefits - to be calculated and paid by the body that accepted them into their employment. This was already in the Bill as laid down. As it stands today, Enterprise Ireland does not have a superannuation scheme but will establish one once the Forfás legislation - the Industrial Development (Forfás Dissolution) Bill 2013 - has been passed and enacted. This Bill allows Enterprise Ireland to become an employer in its own right.</p>, <p eid="para_113"> The amendment to section 12(5)(b) deals with the existing and deferred pensioners from the county enterprise boards. The amendment to section 8 ensures the liability for those pensioners does not transfer to Enterprise Ireland. The amendment to section 12(5)(b) allows for the responsibility and liability of those pensioners to transfer to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and for those pensions to be calculated and paid by the Minister. The amendment to section 12(5)(c) ensures the functions in relation to any existing pension schemes that were vested in a county enterprise board will now be vested in the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_126">I thank the Senators who support the legislation. A service level agreement is in place to underpin the establishment of the local enterprise offices. The local enterprise offices will be supported by Enterprise Ireland's own microenterprise and small business division, which has established a centre of excellence that is responsible for developing an improved environment for small and medium-sized businesses, the businesses that are the core of the economy. I do not see how that could be a bad thing; in fact, it is quite a progressive move. Following the dissolution of the 35 county enterprise boards and the transfer of their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland, the staff will still be ring-fenced and will retain their expertise and responsibility for enterprise policy and budgets. We regard this as a progressive move. We see the establishment of a first-stop shop for entrepreneurs, existing small business owners or micro-businesses as a positive step forward. That it is underpinned by a service level agreement, ultimately with Enterprise Ireland, gives it a very firm foundation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_173">I thank the Senator for raising the issue. While dementia can bring many challenges both for the person with the condition and people caring for them, thankfully there is an increasing recognition that people can live and live well with dementia for a number of years as long as the right supports are in place. I am pleased to advise the Senator that the first ever comprehensive strategy that is specifically dedicated to dementia in Ireland is at an advanced stage of development. Our overarching policy is committed to supporting people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate. We will continue to develop health services around the country, wherever possible, to enhance quality provision and patient safety.</p>, <p eid="para_174"> The HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as St. Joseph's Hospital, Ennis. St. Joseph's Hospital is predominantly an older person's public residential unit that provides a range of care including long stay, short stay, respite, palliative and consultant-led rehabilitative care. I must stress that the facility caters for people with varying levels of dementia also.</p>, <p eid="para_175"> In County Clare consultant-led mental health beds for older persons are used at Cappahard Lodge and in the acute psychiatric unit. Without question, the service is well aware that a more appropriate environment is desirable. In this context, beds used by the older person's service at St. Joseph's Hospital were refurbished for the intended takeover by the mental health service. The refurbished beds are not operated by the mental health service, but they are open and being used to very good effect. The HSE is exploring every opportunity to redirect existing mental health resources to move the refurbished beds under the direction of that service. A sub-committee was put in place this year and will shortly determine if such is possible. It must be stressed that it was never intended or indicated that new additional resources would be available for such beds, as they were intended to replace existing beds and, therefore, would be resource neutral.</p>, <p eid="para_176"> The HSE will have a definitive position on the matter by the summer. This is one part of a multidisciplinary response by mental health services to dementia in County Clare. In the wider context of developments of old age psychiatry, Clare Mental Health Services has a dedicated consultant-led team for psychiatry of old age which caters for a potential population of approximately 14,500 older people aged over 65 years. This is based in Cappahard Lodge, Ennis and consists of a non-consultant hospital doctor, nursing, psychology, social worker and occupational therapy care.</p>, <p eid="para_177">As part of development funding allocated to the mid-west, an additional five staff were allocated and are in place in psychiatry of later life in County Clare. There are advanced plans to develop a day care centre on the St. Joseph's Hospital site specifically for people with dementia, and the HSE is in the final stages of negotiations on this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_178"> The needs of older people are and will remain a very high priority. The resources that are available will be applied to provide the best possible mix of supports and services in a way that most effectively matches the needs and preferences of older people, with a particular focus on enabling people to live as independently as possible within their own communities.</p>]
[<p eid="para_181">I thank the Senator for his response. I will certainly raise this issue, not only with the Minister for Health but also with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has a specific area of responsibility in this regard and I am taking the Adjournment on her behalf. I note the Senator said he would raise this matter again on the Adjournment in the Seanad within the next six to eight weeks. If I may advise, if the Senator was in a position to approach the Minister of State directly, I am sure she would be more than delighted to discuss this in person with him.</p>, <p eid="para_182"> I also note the manner in which the issue was raised with the Senator by a constituent of his whose family member is acutely affected by the provision of these services. We want to ensure we supply these services appropriately and, as I said, bearing in mind at all times the dignity of the people who need these services. It is taking time. There is a timeline and we would be very hopeful of sticking to that timeline.</p>]
