SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-06-05T14:20:00+01:00	I thank the Senators for putting forward the amendment. Section 5, which the Senators are proposing to amend, provides for a significant change to the Friendly Societies Act 1896. That is the cessation of registration of any new societies under section 8 of the legislation. The rationale for the change, as I set out on Second and Committee Stages, is twofold. First, the lack of demand for the friendly society model, evidenced by the fact that there have been just three new entrants in the past nine years. That gives a clear indication that the friendly society model is no longer favoured by newly-establishing organisations. Second, current legislation does not provide for prudential supervision of friendly societies by any public authority. This is a source of some concern because there is some potential risk to the interests of certain members of the public where societies offer financial services.  Section 8 the 1896 Act sets out the types of society that may be registered. There is currently nothing in the section which would preclude a society from seeking the authorisation of the Central Bank, under the Central Bank and Financial Services Act 2003, to carry on a regulated business as defined in that Act. The Central Bank Acts provide specific exemptions for friendly societies from the requirements that relate to banking. Under sections 7 and 8 of the Central Bank Act 1971 a friendly society is exempt from the requirement to hold a banking licence. Under section 29(a) of the Central Bank Act 1997, a friendly society is exempt from the requirement to hold an authorisation as a retail credit firm.  I believe, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary, and does not add to the Act in terms of clarity. There are no references to a "regulated business" in the Friendly Societies Acts and no definition of what is intended by the term. Introducing such a concept in the manner proposed by the amendment is not practical. Further, the amendment as drafted refers to "a person who wishes to carry on a regulated business" when the Act refers to societies, not persons. In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment because I do not believe it to be a workable amendment, as currently constituted.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T14:30:00+01:00	Section 6, which the Senators are proposing to amend, places restrictions on existing societies establishing a loan fund, as provided for in section 46 of the principal Friendly Societies Act 1896 where they do not already have such a fund in place. The change will not have an impact on existing societies that have a fund in place. This amounts to three societies at present. The rationale behind the change, as mentioned on Committee Stage and on Second Stage, is that such activity where it is operated by any other body, is subject to prudential supervision by the Central Bank. There is no prudential supervision by any public authority in the case of a friendly society. While the number of friendly societies operating a loan fund is very small, it is not in the interests of the members of friendly societies that new funds be permitted to be established without appropriate prudential supervision. I hope that addresses the essential spirit of the overarching point made by Senator Barrett. In section 6, our aim is to prevent friendly societies - apart from the small number already engaged in such activity - from operating a loan fund that is not subject to prudential supervision. The exception provided is to allow any application that may be in hand, where an application to register a rule change has been passed by the society and lodged with the registrar by the operative date, to progress under the current rules so that it will not disadvantaged an existing society. Given the general lack of interest, even among existing societies, in operating in the area, an influx of societies seeking to establish loan funds is not anticipated. The Senator's proposal is worded to amend section 6 and to require that "the formation of a separate loan fund" should receive authorisation under the Central Bank and Financial Services Act 2003. This is not a workable amendment because the Act authorises the carrying on of the financial activity itself, namely, the granting of loans, not formation of the fund. On that basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T14:30:00+01:00	Section 8, which the Senators are proposing to amend, removes the restriction in the current Act providing that the registrar must be absent for the powers, functions and duties to be exercised and performed by such other person as the Minister may authorise, and allows another person to act alongside the registrar. The change is necessary as, for the past number of years, the role of Registrar of Friendly Societies has not been a dedicated role, but has been fulfilled by the Registrar of Companies in addition to her existing duties. The amendment proposed by the Senators, which I understand seeks to transfer powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Central Bank, will not operate as intended by the Senators because section 5 of the 1977 Act sets out powers of the Minister with regard to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and not the powers of the registrar. There is a reference to the powers, functions and duties of the registrar in section 5 but it relates to who may be authorised by the Minister to perform these powers, rather than setting out the powers themselves. Section 6 of the 1977 Act does relate to a specific power regarding cancellation of the registration of societies but, as I do not believe it to be the intention of the Senators in drafting this amendment to transfer powers solely relating to cancellation of societies to the Central Bank, I do not accept the amendment. It is intended to examine further with the Central Bank and the Department of Finance the issue of appropriate prudential supervision for friendly societies. At present the powers to exercise such supervision do not exist under the friendly societies legislation and therefore appropriate powers must be put in place. No existing powers can be simply transferred. It is considered that the best place to address the matter is under the Central Bank Acts rather than the Friendly Societies Acts. I wish to restate what I said on previous Stages. The Friendly Societies Acts do not confer corporate status on societies or limited liability on members. The evidence in recent years is that it has become common practice for many charities and clubs to register as limited companies. I hope to give some confidence to Senator Barrett in addressing the points he has made by reiterating that the most realistic institutional option for introducing an appropriate system of supervision is the Central Bank, which is at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight. It has a responsibility to provide in a fully integrated and co-ordinated manner for the prudential supervision and stability of all financial services within the financial system as a whole. To avoid the possibility of other bodies moving into this unregulated area it was decided to close registration to new friendly societies.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-06-05T14:40:00+01:00	I wish to take a few brief moments to thank the Members for their contribution to the debate. In particular, I thank those Senators who put down amendments. I assure them that the area of financial prudential supervision is something that is been taken seriously. This is best carried out through the Central Bank Acts. While I am not accepting the amendment I hope we have addressed adequately the substantive issues in the legislation. I thank the Senators for their co-operation and their time.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-06-05T14:50:00+01:00	I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is unable to be present as she is attending a meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg. I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and acknowledge the consistency with which he has advocated on it. As the Minister recently announced, an independent review group has been established to undertake a review of the Department of Justice and Equality. The independent review group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, has been asked to undertake a comprehensive review of the performance, management and administration of the Department. It will assess and report on the roles, responsibilities and capabilities of the Department, including the following: concerns in respect of the governance and oversight of external organisations identified in particular in the report of Mr. Sean Guerin, SC; the Department's performance in discharging its responsibilities, implementing its programmes and achieving its desired strategic outcomes, as set out in its statement of strategy; and the effectiveness of the Department's current structure, systems, management and capabilities. In making its recommendations the group will have regard to the policy, legal, institutional and resource framework within which the Department works. It will also draw on international best practice regarding the organisational structures, skills, training and levels required by the Department in order that it can fulfil its roles and responsibilities. It may engage additional expertise to help with its work, as it sees fit. Based on the conclusions and lessons drawn from this assessment, it will make recommendations to the Minister who has already commented that she believes the report will be an important signpost on the path to reform and enable the Department to build on its considerable strengths and fully address areas that need improvement. Before I comment on the specific case referred to by the Senator, I wish to make it clear that the Minister does not wish in any way to pre-empt the work of the independent review group or how it will focus its efforts in the light of its terms of reference. At this stage, she would simply reflect that it was not anticipated that the independent review group would necessarily be the best means to address the detail of specific cases such as the one referred to, although its findings will, of course, be relevant to how the range of the Department's functions are delivered. The Department is not aware of any question having arisen relating to the Department in the context of the case referred to by the Senator. It, of course, is not involved in the investigation of criminal offences. The Garda Commissioner previously directed that an examination be carried out of the procedures surrounding the handling of the complaints against the person in question. The Minister is advised by the Garda authorities that a review has been completed of a number of complaints made against the person concerned. However, further information has recently been provided for the Garda and this has necessitated further examination by gardaí before the review can be finalised. The Minister is advised that this process is ongoing. The Minister wishes to assure the Senator that the need to learn from past child protection failures is a priority for her and the Government. This is reflected in the transformation of child protection arrangements which have taken place since the Government took office. In particular, the Senator will be aware of the recent publication by the Minister when she was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs of the Children First Bill 2014 which will, for the first time, provide for key elements of the Children First guidelines to be put on a statutory basis. This builds on other significant legislative and administrative measures which have been put in place in recent years to better protect children. In the light of the Minister's clear commitment in this regard, she will be asking the acting Garda Commissioner to ensure the review in question is completed as soon as possible. I again thank the Senator for raising the issue. I will convey his comments during this debate to the Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T14:50:00+01:00	I acknowledge the points made by the Senator. I will convey these concerns to the Minister on his behalf.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T15:00:00+01:00	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. As a Minister of State in the relevant Department, I am acutely aware of the predicament in which that school community finds itself. I take this opportunity to inform the House that I am not going to read directly from the prepared script. As I understand it, the Firhouse Educate Together school was established to service a specific demographic demand within the Firhouse area. The Senator referred to the South Dublin County Council plan, etc., and in that context, the school should ideally have a permanent home within or as close to the geographical area in which it is currently located as possible in order to meet people's needs. A process is ongoing whereby officials from the Department of Education and Skills are working with their counterparts in South Dublin County Council in order to acquire a suitable site. In the context of the Department's geographical information system and analysis, the Ballycullen-Oldcourt area is considered a separate and distinct geographical area. The local area plan for Ballycullen-Oldcourt refers to the planned future additional population. This means that the area will have educational infrastructural requirements in its own right should the planned housing developments for it materialise. I am given to understand that the process relating to identifying and acquiring a site for Firhouse Educate Together is ongoing. The Senator indicated that she previously raised this matter last November. It has been my experience that the process of acquiring land tends to be open-ended in nature. It is very difficult, for example, to put in place sunset clauses in respect of the acquisition of land or to disregard the commercial sensitivities involved. The process is ongoing and due to the kind of commercial sensitivities to which I refer, it is not possible to provide further information at this time. I am sure the Senator has heard that before and I do not wish to offer her any platitudes in respect of this issue. I am aware, however, from my dealings with the officials in the Department, that when interacting with local authorities, there is a process which must be undergone. The process is not seamless and can involve many twists and turns. That will come as no comfort to Senator Keane in the context of her attempts to represent the interests of the people who made representations to her. I assure her that I will raise the matter with the relevant officials in the Department and that I will exert as much pressure as possible in the context of establishing the current position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T15:00:00+01:00	I accept those points and I recognise that Firhouse Educate Together is currently occupying temporary accommodation, which is certainly not ideal. I have come across situations such as this previously whereby schoolchildren are being obliged to learn in what can only be described as Dickensian conditions while they await the provision of permanent accommodation. I wish to give Senator Keane an undertaking to the effect that I will raise this matter within the Department. I must point out, however, that it is not only in respect of the acquisition of privately-owned land that sensitivities arise. I take the Senator's point regarding the upward trajectory of property prices in the Dublin area. However, sensitivities also arise when land is being transferred from one public body, local authority or State entity to another. There are many legalities which must be dealt with in that context. Regardless of whether it is a private or public entity involved, the process is not seamless. As a result, the acquisition of a suitable site is taking some time to bring to a conclusion. I fully acknowledge that. I will bring the points made by Senator Keane to the attention of the officials within the Department.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-05T15:10:00+01:00	I thank Senator Bradford for raising this issue. The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually. I accept the point made by the Senator in regard to budget 2012, whereby as part of that budget there is a phased increase in the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools with four teachers or less. The current system operates on the basis of a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS band 1 schools. I have not seen the correspondence Senator Bradford referred to, but I acknowledge pressures are being brought to bear in terms of the classroom experience, both for pupils and for teachers. I acknowledge also that budgetary measures taken in 2012 brought pressure, a result of macro-economic factors. The Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the schools that are affected by the budget measure. Small schools will not lose their classroom post if they project sustainable increased enrolments in September 2014 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. We are all aware of the appeals process and the staffing circulars and the processes involved.  I acknowledge the general point being made by the Senator that we must ensure there is a role for small schools within rural communities. Both he and I hail from the same region and such communities. The Department has taken a conscious decision to ensure that schools which had no inward investment for many years, for example, in regard to capital expenditure and bricks and mortar, are seeing investment. Projects are now going on throughout our region and the country to replace prefabs with bricks and mortar. This is part of trying to make the experience for students and school communities better. In rural areas, these schools are the institutions underpinning the community.  The Senator will be aware that a value for money review was conducted on small primary schools. The review took account of the ethos of schools and of their locations relative to other similar schools. We are currently considering the value for money reviews, in consultation with Government colleagues, and it is intended to publish the report on completion of the consideration process. We are very mindful of the points raised by Senator Bradford in regard to the budget 2012 measures. We seek to ensure we have a sustainable model for the future, but I acknowledge there are challenges in that regard.  The Minister has had initial discussions with the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA, and the Irish National Teachers Organisation in regard to their proposals on the issue of primary school consolidation and reorganisation. We acknowledge that some 48 small schools have had a reduction in enrolments, which means that for September 2014 they will lose a teacher. We acknowledge these losses would not have occurred if the pre-budget 2012 enrolment threshold still applied and if the threshold for a two-teacher school had remained at 12 pupils. We acknowledge the constraints that exist currently. However, the value for money review is under consideration and will be published.  Speaking personally, I will advocate strongly for assurances to be given on the future of schools and for consultation and engagement with stakeholders in a meaningful process of dialogue which will ensure a future for these schools. Then we can begin to address the dynamic the Senator outlined in regard to the new pressures that exist in particular schools and classrooms as economic circumstances improve.
