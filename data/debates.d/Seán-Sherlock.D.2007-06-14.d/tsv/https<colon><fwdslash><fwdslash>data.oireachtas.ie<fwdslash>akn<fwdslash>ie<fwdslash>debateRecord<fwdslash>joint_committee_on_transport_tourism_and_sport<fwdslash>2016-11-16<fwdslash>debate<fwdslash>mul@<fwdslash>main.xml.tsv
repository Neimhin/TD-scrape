SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T09:30:00+00:00	I note with interest Mr. Nolan's submission, especially where he refers to the capital investment programme, saying, "Should additional funding be allocated following the mid-term review of the plan, TII will look at the potential to accelerate certain projects, the construction of additional projects and the planning of others, including the upgrade of the strategic connection between Cork and Limerick." In the context of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs and regional economic growth and development, the Cork to Limerick corridor, or the Atlantic corridor as it was known previously, is a vital link because there are more than 300,000 jobs earmarked for that region in the action plan.Is the M20 being actively considered in discussions between Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister in terms of ensuring that the project, which is so vital to the economic and social interests of the people in the south, south west and west, is progressed? Is there any potential for money to be made available on the basis of the submission that has been made to this committee? The witnesses have said that it can take five years to achieve planning approval for major roads projects. They also said that we risk having a shortage of approved projects for inclusion in any new capital investment plan. Failure to respond to future needs will lead to increased congestion. Reading between the lines, TII is sending a signal that this project is vital and that funding is required to get it through planning or at least to the first phase. I am not talking about an entire package of funding for absolute completion but funding to at least progress the project. Is there a funding line for that project?  Under the previous capital investment plan announced by the last Government there was a specific reference to the relief road for Mallow. As everyone knows, Mallow forms part of the M20 corridor. The people of Mallow and north Cork want to know when they can expect to see that work starting. They also want to know if TII, the Department and the Minister are considering the question of dovetailing the two projects. How will the two projects coalesce?  There is an understanding on all sides of the need for the M20 Cork to Limerick project. That is understood by everybody in an apolitical sense but the question is, "When?". The submission to the committee today suggests that a political decision on funding will be vital in order to get the project off the starting blocks.  I want to acknowledge the constructive engagement I have had with TII on national secondary roads. Notwithstanding the dearth of funding that is available for such roads there have been some improvements to the N72 and the N73 in the north Cork area of late. However, further funding is required for these roads. There is a serious public safety issue, particularly with regard to the Mallow to Mitchelstown link which serves as a corridor west of Mallow for connectivity onward to Dublin. It is a vital transport corridor but there are parts of that national secondary road that are so narrow that two lorries trying to pass each other would have to slow down to 5 kmph to do so safely. I am making the case for further investment from a road safety point of view and ask that this be actively considered and prioritised in the TII budget line in co-operation with Cork County Council.  To reiterate my earlier point, if it takes five years to achieve planning approval for major road projects such as the M20 then we need a signal now from TII that it is engaging with the Department on the Cork to Limerick section of the route. We need to see some progress made.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:20:00+00:00	Is it appropriate for me to seek clarification?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:20:00+00:00	Effectively, Mr. Nolan is saying that this progressed significantly in that resources have been made available to get the M20, Cork to Limerick, back on the planning agenda.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:30:00+00:00	Thank you, Chairman, for your indulgence on this matter. It is a vital piece of infrastructure. The witness mentioned the abolition of quotas and, perhaps, going back to a blank page again because the previous routes that had been selected might have to be revised. That is not to put words into his mouth. As I said previously, there is a situation with the Mallow relief road. It is a vital dovetail to this project. That is the view of the Mallow Development Partnership, which is a stakeholder group, and Dairygold Co-operative Society Ltd., one of the biggest dairy co-operatives in the country. With the abolition of milk quotas, there is talk about massive drying plants in Mallow and Mitchelstown. The vehicular issues in Mallow arising from agricultural transport and milk production will be vital. That is the reason the thinking behind the northern relief road, in terms of dovetailing into the M20 project, will be important. I am not saying the witness will have the wisdom of Solomon on that at this juncture for the purposes of this committee, but I seek a sense from him of how that project will progress now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:30:00+00:00	I am glad the Deputy is coming around to my way of thinking.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:40:00+00:00	I also asked about the N72 and N73. I would like a reply about the road safety issue. Ideally Mr. Nolan should drive the stretch of road between Mitchelstown and Mallow. We all acknowledge the works on sections of the road between Mallow and Fermoy and Mallow and Mitchelstown but there are still sections which are very unsafe.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-11-16T10:40:00+00:00	That is the ideal time to drive it to see how bad it is. I thank Mr. Nolan.
