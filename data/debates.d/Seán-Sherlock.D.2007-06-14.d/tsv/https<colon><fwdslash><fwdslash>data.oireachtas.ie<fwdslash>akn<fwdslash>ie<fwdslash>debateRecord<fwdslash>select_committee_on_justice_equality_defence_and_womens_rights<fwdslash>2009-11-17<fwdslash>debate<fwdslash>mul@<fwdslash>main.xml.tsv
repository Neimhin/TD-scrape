[<p eid="para_52">My amendment is along the same lines as that of Deputy Flanagan.  We seek a certain amount of flexibility to reflect changes in monetary values to allow the Minister of the day, by order, to amend the amounts so the Bill is not outdated in terms of the tabular form in which the fines are set out.  That is the justification.</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">I would have thought our amendment on this issue would have developed an efficiency in the system in terms of how one deals with it into the future.  If it can be looked at again on Report Stage I would accept that.</p>]

[<p eid="para_129">I speak as a layman, not a solicitor or lawyer.  Forgive my seeming ignorance, but the Minister says the section addresses indexation.

[<p eid="para_135">I move amendment No. 25:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2009.18.dail.3.amd_25"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_136">In page 11, line 13, after "income" to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_137">"and the amount and nature of the person's annual outgoings".</p>, <p eid="para_138">I will address the three amendments.  The Minister has stated the ultimate aim is to try and keep as many people out of prison as possible.  That is the aim of these amendments also.  The Minister speaks with some sympathy of the need to ensure that people's circumstances are taken into account.  What we seek through these amendments is to try and get as full a picture as possible of an individual's circumstances, before a decision is made as to the sanction to be applied.  Amendment No. 25 proposes the court should be required to consider an offender's outgoings as well as income.  The purpose of amendment No. 26 is to ensure the court considers all assets, not just real or personal property, and debts due to the person.  There could be other assets that do not fall within the provisions of the Bill as drafted.  These might include intellectual property, for example.  The purpose of amendment No. 27 is to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>) because an earlier amendment proposes to amalgamate that paragraph with a general paragraph, (<i>b</i>), dealing with assets.</p>, <p eid="para_139">These three amendments act as a precursor to later amendments, Nos. 28, 29 and 32.  We believe that if the purpose of the legislation is to try and keep as many people out of prison as possible, the State must try and create the necessary conditions by which that can occur.  Statistically, one does not find many rich people in prison as a result of non-payment of fines.  Those in prison are mainly those people who are more marginalised.  While I agree some sanction is necessary, I ask the Minister to ensure we create a situation whereby their financial circumstances are taken into account to a greater degree than in the Bill as drafted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_142">I move amendment No. 28:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2009.18.dail.3.amd_28"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_143">In page 11, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_144">"(3) Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (2)</i>, where a person is convicted of an offence for which a fine or a sentence of imprisonment, or both, may be imposed, the court—</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_145">(<i>a</i>) shall consider whether a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_146">(<i>b</i>) shall, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, take into account the person’s financial circumstances in determining the amount of the fine to impose in respect of the offence;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_147">(<i>c</i>) shall not, if satisfied that a fine is appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case but that, having regard to the person’s financial circumstances, undue hardship would be caused by the imposition of a fine of any amount greater than a nominal amount, impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of such a fine if a sentence of imprisonment would not be appropriate to meet the circumstances of the case, but may in that event direct the payment of the fine by instalments for such period as the court shall fix, but without prejudice to the power of the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu of payment of a fine in such amount as the court considers is within the capacity of the defendant to pay.”.</p>, <p eid="para_148">This amendment strengthens the amendments we put forward earlier.  We suggest that where a person of full age is convicted of an offence, the court shall, in determining the amount of the fine, if any, to impose in respect of the offence, take into account the person's financial circumstances or difficulties, as is most likely the case.  The purpose of the amendment is to address the situation where fine and-or imprisonment are available to the court and to ensure that imprisonment is not imposed simply because the defendant does not have the means to pay what would otherwise be an appropriate fine.  We ask for some leniency for those most impoverished who find themselves before the courts that their circumstances be taken into account.  That is the justification for that amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_150">Amendment No. 29 seeks to insert section 15(3) into a more logical place in the Bill.  The purpose of amendment No. 32 is to make clear that imprisonment should not be imposed for failure to pay a fine which is caused by the inability of a person to pay the fine.  If people are not able to pay and can prove they are unable to pay then they should not be sentenced to imprisonment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">I accept that.  For what type of offence does the Minister envisage that a community service order would be carried out?  Does he envisage it would be for a specific type of offence?</p>]
[<p eid="para_155">I accept that.  If a person reneges on a fine would the community service order be for X number of hours?</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">I take it that the Minister will revisit amendment No. 32.</p>]
[<p eid="para_162">I appreciate that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_171">The amendment goes some way towards addressing the issue of a person's outgoings, assuming that any such information with regard to financial circumstances is made available to the court and assuming that a person's outgoings can be included in that particular provision.  If that is the case it lends weight to the idea that an overall view is taken of a person's circumstances before a decision is made.  I welcome the amendment.</p>]

</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_183">In page 12, subsection (1), line 36, after "fine," to insert "or upon the court's own motion,".</p>, <p eid="para_184">The purpose of this amendment is to allow the court to impose a fine by instalment on its own motion, without the individual having to make an application.  In the absence of our amendment the court must first impose a blanket fine and the defendant would have to apply for an instalment order.  The court would then make the instalment order.  The court is not permitted to make an instalment order from the outset.  This is unduly cumbersome and we suggest the court be given that discretion.</p>, <p eid="para_185">The purpose of amendment No. 34 is to set a lower threshold for the court in making an instalment order.  We contend that for the court to be satisfied would involve quite a high level of proof.  The amendment proposes that it appears to the court as a more satisfactory test.  That is a self-explanatory justification for the amendments.</p>]

</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_215">In page 13, lines 44 and 45, to delete subsection (9)</p>, <p eid="para_216">Subsection (9) prohibits the courts from allowing payment by instalments in relation to a fine of €100 or less.  However, in our view there would be many people who would find it difficult to pay fines of €100 or less at one time and may require that  the payment be made in instalments.  In this amendment, we are trying to provide for those people who are issued with a fine of €100 or less to pay it off in instalments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_220">The reason we tabled that amendment is that I know people who are in arrears with the local authority for refuse charges to the tune of €200 to €300, which on the grand scale of things seems quite a small amount, but who are paying the local authority as little as €5 per week to reduce that debt.  There will be instances where fines are imposed on people in similar circumstances who are most likely to carry multiple debts, for whom €100 will be a significant amount.</p>, <p eid="para_221">I understand the point the Minister made about striking the balance between the fine being instigated in the first instance and the need to pay it.  If the Minister would look at this issue again before Report Stage with a view to ensuring that for fines of €100 or less, there could be a minimum or maximum number of instalments to bear out the point he made about the number of transactions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Courts Service.  I want to ensure that the Minister takes cognisance of the very small proportion of people for whom fines of €100 or less will be quite significant.</p>]
[<p eid="para_223">I ask the Minister to look at it again and come back to us with the exact statistics.</p>]
[<p eid="para_225">The Minister cannot say the vast majority of fines relate to road traffic offences.</p>]
