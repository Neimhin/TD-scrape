SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:10:00+01:00	It is my Bill and I have many questions but I am conscious that I am a guest of the committee.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:10:00+01:00	I thank the members. I thank the officials and the academics for their attendance today because I believe that having this opportunity to interact with them is a crucial part of the legislative process. I view it as a free tutorial, for which I am very grateful. I also thank the Chair and the members of the committee for facilitating the discussion this morning. The key point that emerges from the evidence before us is that there is no doubt but that there is clear evidence of the presence of microfibres and microbeads in sea life and on land, having been washed ashore. The witnesses have presented clear evidence of that today. The Dublin Bay prawn presented is a very distinct piece of evidence to that effect. I believe this makes the legislation all the more worthwhile in that sense.  I appreciate the point being made about the legislation I have introduced. It deals specifically with microbeads that, according to the presentation, represent a small fraction in sea life and flora and fauna. However, my Bill is a first or a second cut. This is an iterative process and I am not tied to the fact that it should deal only with microbeads. I am quite happy for it to be amended in any way to reflect the realities of the science presented before us. If that means dealing with microfibres or any other particles present that fall into the general microplastic group, then I have no qualms about that whatsoever. The key thing is that we are at a juncture where we are acknowledging there is a need to legislate on this issue. It needs to be done post-haste.  My first question is to the officials, namely, Mr. Harrington and Mr. O'Connor. They mentioned that the heads of a Bill will come before us or that a Bill is being worked on. Can they be more specific on when that Government Bill will come before the House?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	I appreciate that and that is clear evidence of action by the Government in this regard. While this not a remark directed at the officials per se but is more a political statement, I must state that this legislation has been in gestation since 2016. I had hoped we would be further along the line at this stage because I have always expressed my willingness to withdraw my Bill were more robust legislation to come along. This is a non-partisan and a non-political issue. I want to take a bipartisan approach to this matter. I still feel the need to ensure my legislation is kept on the books until such time as I see evidence from the Government as to the seriousness of its intentions. That is notwithstanding the additional resources which have been allocated to this.  I refer back to the originator of the legislation, who is Senator Grace O'Sullivan. We are only taking up the cudgel on this. However, we do need to see this Government legislation sooner rather than later. I welcome the fact that Mr. Harrington is seeking permission within a month to draw up heads of a Bill. I am anxious that the clock might tick down on the lifetime of the Government or that its mandate may expire. It is a Private Members' Bill. I am conscious that if Mr. Harrington is talking about the summer months for this, it then will not be long until we are into the autumn and then into 2019. We do not know what is going to happen then. As I understand it, my Private Members' Bill falls on the ending of that mandate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	In 2018?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	I appreciate those comments. I recognise Mr. Harrington is speaking for the Minister here. However, we will have an opportunity to talk to the Minister directly about this as well and kick the tyres on his commitments. I will return briefly to the science again, just for a moment. The scientific rigour that has been applied here shows us that the research in an Irish context is nascent in the grand narrative of things. It is from 2014 I think. I acknowledge the witnesses probably have all been working in this area prior to this. Can I get a sense from the witnesses as to where the Legislature needs to go on this issue? That is pulling them from the realm of pure academic research into the realm of politics. I am directing this at Dr. Nash. If she was designing legislation or a response to the scourge of microplastics and microbeads, this plastic pollution that is killing our flora and fauna and being ingested by human beings, where would she go, where would she start or what would she do? It is a tough one but I just want to get the perspectives of the witnesses on it because I think it is vital.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	Forgive me, does that mean more time is needed to design the legislation? If the legislation is to be designed in a robust way, does it need a stronger scientific and research basis? Is Dr. Nash stating that industry needs to be involved because the generators of these plastics need to be involved? Is she talking about a more holistic approach?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	Just-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:20:00+01:00	To be helpful, I recognise that Dr. Nash is saying that it is too narrow and that microbeads, based on the evidence put forward from Nephrops norvegicus, were only something like 2% of the content and 75% was microfibres. That makes the legislative proposal before us here quite narrow.We could legislate for microbeads, but the point is we need legislation with much broader scope because, based on the evidence before us, microbeads only represent a portion of the plastics used. In that sense, the legislation is quite narrow.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:30:00+01:00	As I am conscious of time and the format being used, I am happy to stop and come back in at the end of the process, with the Chairman's permission.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:50:00+01:00	Is Cuala the GAA-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:50:00+01:00	As the originator of the Bill, the Deputy is correct in the sense that the initial mood of the Government and the speech that was distributed to us on the night of the Second Stage debate was in opposition to the Bill. There have been some discussions with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to his credit and he decided subsequently to come on board. I think Deputy Barry is correct in that sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T10:50:00+01:00	I am again conscious of time. My Bill is very simple and it deals with a bespoke element of the entirety of the challenge - microbeads. I am very happy to change the title of my Bill to call it the prohibition of microbeads Bill 2016 or such. This is where the scientific research has been invaluable to us. It really explains to us just how large the scope is and the methodology that one needs to underpin all of the research, and that work is ongoing. The wording of my Bill is "any cosmetic containing micro-plastics is guilty of an offence". I allow for summary offences. It calls for penalties if one manufactures, sells or imports. I also set out what would be actually banned. These are all what I would call products of conspicuous consumption. They are not necessities. They include a "personal care product including but not limited to a facial scrub, soap, lotion, shower gel, sunscreen, make-up, deodorant or toothpaste". We are not banning those products but we are banning products of that nature that contain microbeads. We have a scientific definition of microbeads. My Bill is very simple. Notwithstanding the Government's intention, I cannot see what it is that the committee will produce that is more robust or comprehensive than this if we are dealing specifically and only with the issue of microbeads. That is the point I really want to make. I welcome this interaction and the bona fides of the Department officials. I recognise the challenge. Maybe the wording of my Bill needs work and I acknowledge that. One could amend my Bill to say that microbeads or microplastics means plastic particles of less than 5 mm in diameter, for instance.In one fell swoop, the legislation would remove an array of products for which there is incontrovertible proof that they find their way into watercourses. That could be done in a very short time. That was also the intention of Senator Grace O'Sullivan's Bill before it was opposed. I do not see why that could not be done at an early juncture while working on the wider issues of marine litter in parallel. The witnesses came here with the issue of marine litter very firmly in their sights. Finally, I return to Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point that the funding for research on this is something that needs to be looked at. I will go to Science Foundation Ireland and will speak to the Minister and the Marine Institute to see if there is a mechanism. It may be that there is a mechanism for researching this area in terms of societal challenges through Horizon 2020. I was at the negotiating table for Horizon 2020 and recall that this was looked at as one of the societal challenges and that there should be funds available for this. It would not take a lot of money to buttress the research that the witnesses are doing which is vital if we are looking at the entirety of the coastline of Ireland.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-28T11:00:00+01:00	It does not go into the part that is consumed. It is important to state that for the record.
