[<p eid="para_75">I want to look at the recommendations, set out in the presentation which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_76">There needs to be a review of the objectives of regulation as, in our opinion, neither the objectives nor reasons for regulation are fully understood by the public service or the wider political stakeholders.</p>, <p eid="para_77">Is it Mr. Fielding's view, given that he has quoted the CSO example in that firm, that the CSO imposes an obligation through the Statistics Act, on businesses to supply the figures but that the CSO has no clear understanding of the administrative or cost burden that places on the business and it is acting as just one arm of Government to do that?  In effect, Government needs to ensure that businesses are not over regulated in a way that increases their administrative functions for no stated aim at the end of the day, except that it gathers figures which may or may not be used productively.  Is the higher level group on business regulation looking at that specific topic and getting into the nitty gritty to ensure that business function is taken away from that business person so that he or she does not have to waste a number of labour hours over the course of a week preparing material for which there is no gain to the business person and only adds to his burden of work?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">In terms of the regulatory process as a whole, Mr. Fielding makes the distinction between the light touch regulation of the banks and the heavy regulation for SMEs.  I am sympathetic to everything that has been stated here because we deal with them at the front end.  For example, in regard to Revenue, there are scenarios where agreements are struck between businesses and Revenue in regard to outstanding obligations for taxation and so on but what is happening in the SME sector is that guys are not able to collect the money outstanding and due to them.  While one gets a sense that Revenue is flexible in stretching out the time lines and is coming up with agreed repayment schedules, the agreement on a repayment schedule is made in good faith by the SME but what happens is that the goalposts shift further in that the person who owes the money outstanding is not in a position to pay and then the heavy hand comes back down on the business.  I am dealing with one such engineering firm in north Cork which is finding it very difficult to get to talk to Revenue.  The reason he is finding it difficult is that having already been in to Revenue and drawn up a schedule, the payments due on invoices have not come in and Revenue is now putting the heavy hand on him.  To see that business thrive, I want to see him being given some sort of a break.  His impression, as a business owner, is that Revenue will come down heavy on him and shut him down, rather than cut him more slack.  How as politicians do we legislate to cut that business a bit of slack in current times?</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">Is it impertinent of me to ask that copies of the correspondence, without referring to the individuals in question, could be furnished to the joint committee?  That would assist us in seeking to effect changes to the legislation, if necessary.</p>, <p eid="para_83">We must grapple with this issue because it affects sub-contractors who are operating on a more informal basis.  We raised this issue at the previous meeting.  If we had substantive evidence and bearing in mind that we can conceal people's identity, that would assist in highlighting this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">Is this happening 100% of the time on all contracts, or is it an intermittent practice?</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">In essence, they have the owners of small businesses effectively over a barrel and there is no legislative provision that protects the small guy because of the contracting out process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">I have a particular interest in the food industry and one of the issues that is coming up in terms of the regulatory regime is the Hassop regulation.  Have food businesses contacted ISME about the overly stringent Hassop regulations, given the way the system works in France, where an artisan producer can continue to produce, and there is no hassle.</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">Is it Mr. Fielding's sense that it speaks to the culture of the country that when legislation  is devised in Brussels, we seem to go hell for leather to try to implement it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_101">I apologise for taking so much time.</p>]
