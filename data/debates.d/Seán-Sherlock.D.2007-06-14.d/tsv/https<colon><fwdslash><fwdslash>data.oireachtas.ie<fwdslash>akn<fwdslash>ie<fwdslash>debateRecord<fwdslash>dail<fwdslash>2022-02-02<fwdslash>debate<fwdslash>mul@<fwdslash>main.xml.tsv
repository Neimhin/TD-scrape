SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T20:20:00+00:00	I will be brief. Firstly, I support the amendment. It is a laudable one and worthy of support. Certainly, the Labour Party seeks to speak in support of the amendment. When the climate action Bill was before us we sought to put forward amendments to provide for specific sectoral targets for afforestation. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications refused to accept those amendments. It was disappointing to say the least. We thought it would have been quite an obvious thing for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to take on board given the pronouncements from that part of Government on the desire to ensure we reach afforestation targets throughout the State. I welcome, therefore, this approach by Sinn Féin which merely asks the Minister to lay a report before Dáil Éireann on the level of afforestation per LEA. It is a reasonable amendment. When you look at the forestry licensing dashboard, which has become the tool we all use for information on the number of afforestation licences and felling licences issued, we can clearly see that while there was an increase in September, October and November, there was a reduction of December. Obviously, January's figures have yet to be published. It seems to me that when you parse the afforestation licences that have been granted, small farmers or private landowners - mainly farmers - received about 26 felling licences. The vast bulk of them are going to Coillte. It received almost double that amount, at 51 licences and that is a constant trend. What I am asking the Minister to do, in supporting this amendment, is to use his good offices to start ensuring that where planting licences, or even felling licences - as there is a natural rate of felling as well - are being applied for, that he remove the impediments to that. There are still too many. I am finding that where felling licences are being applied, smaller farmers who own tracts of forestry are feeling an inordinate amount of stress and strain in respect of the processes they must go through and the hoops they must jump. They are not rich people. They are people who planted in good faith. They are people who sought to look to the future. They are people who want to grow trees again and reapply for afforestation licences. However, the system still has not worked through the issues that have been so well highlighted by the agriculture committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Cahill. We are not seeing enough of a seismic shift to reach those afforestation targets the Government itself has set. This amendment is a very sensible one. If the Minister could meet its proposers on this and support the amendment it would give us a greater degree of transparency and move towards the setting of the clearer targets that are badly needed if we are to meet our sequestration goals, carbon reduction goals and all the self-evident goals I need not explain. There is a real willingness and desire now by forestry owners to plant but there is still too much of a weighting against them in terms of the bureaucracy and the technocratic mechanisms that are in place and it is preventing that from happening. If they can be worked through it would assist the process greatly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T20:50:00+00:00	Specificity is precisely what should be governing primary legislation. This is a specific amendment. It should not be so injurious to the Minister that he should not accept it on the basis that it is overly specific. There is a point to be made here that captures the political zeitgeist. That is about how we take carbon out of society and the economy. One of the ways to do that is through an active afforestation programme. The facts in respect of the dashboard, which is the toolkit we all use, clearly indicate that those targets will not be met. Deputy Carthy has already stated that. We can see it for ourselves. The point of the amendment is that it asks for a level of granularity which is not unreasonable. The Department is a mighty Department in the sense that it has many personnel. It has an ever-growing number of personnel, particularly relating to the processing of afforestation and felling licences. It has many experts now. It would be very easy for the Department to carry out this exercise. I ask the Minister to rethink his position. I fear I am involved in a futile exercise in that regard but I ask that nonetheless.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T21:50:00+00:00	I rise on behalf of the Labour Party to support the amendment. Reference has been made to the former Deputy and former Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Pat the Cope Gallagher, who holds the respect of every single person in this House, both past and present. He spoke with passion in respect of SI 89 of 2019. He argued that natural justice must be allowed to occur and that common law rights should be upheld. What is at issue in this group of amendments is the very principle espoused by former Deputy Gallagher, who represented a coastal community, who was very close to the fishing sector for so many years and who knew it intimately. He served as a guide to many of us who were not so well versed in matters relating to the sector. We are supporting these amendments, quite frankly, because we believe that the long-established principle in common law of beyond reasonable doubt should be inculcated into this legislation. It is as simple as that. Other speakers before me and the proposers of the amendment have articulated that viewpoint very well.  We are debating this legislation in the context of the recent prospect of Russian naval exercises taking place within our exclusive economic zone. The prospect of those exercises highlighted and exposed the weaknesses in our Defence Forces in terms of fisheries patrols and the weaknesses inherent in our own fisheries sector. The idea that there would be, just yesterday, a European Fisheries Control Agency, EFCA, vessel docked in Cobh is anathema to those of us who have great respect for our Defence Forces and specifically for our navy. We now know that the capacity of the navy to patrol our own waters is just not there. The timing of this legislation is all wrong. When I think of the diplomatic win, a win that was not garnered by the Government or any Department of State but by fishers who took on the might of an empire, I am reminded of the Skibbereen Eagle taking on the might of the Tsar of Russia. There was a certain symbolism in that, in the way that people like Patrick Murphy and Brendan Byrne took on the might of the Russian navy. It made me proud to be Irish, that these humble people were defending not only the rights of fishers but also defending the environment and the sustainability of the sector that they represent.They were representing families and individuals who seek to ply their trade, make that catch and make the few shillings to keep life and soul together. It was a fantastic example of David and Goliath. The Minister is proposing legislation that seeks to further trammel the rights of those very same people. If I was advising the Minister, with the Minister himself having taken such a strident view on this very legislation when he was in opposition, I would ask him to roll back a little on it, to take further counsel and not to go down this route in regard to the legislation. This is precisely because, as was articulated in pre-legislative scrutiny, the issue of reasonable doubt, which is a concept that prevails in the common law system, is not present here. While supporting these amendments, I fear we are going to criminalise further ordinary men and women. It is the State leaning too heavily on ordinary men and women. The Minister needs to revise his position on this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T22:10:00+00:00	In response to the Minister, I appreciate the point that this is an administrative scheme and that the concept of the balance of probabilities is applied. I remain open to the expertise of the Minister's own officials, given that they have spent much time going to and from Brussels over the years. Was due cognisance taken of the fact that we are in a common law system? Whether or not there is a criminal sanction for the application of a penalty points system, fishers feel put upon, whether through decommissioning schemes or the outworkings of negotiations at intergovernmental level in respect of Britain's exit from the European Union. There is frustration on the part of fishers that they are getting a smaller and smaller part of the pot with every successive negotiation. Does the Minister acknowledge the frustration of the Opposition as it seeks to introduce amendments of this nature? It is trying to ensure that if a penalty points system is introduced, it does not further impose upon the fishers and they are not put upon. Can the Minister understand where fishers are coming from? They feel as if there is a slow and gradual erosion of their livelihoods.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T22:10:00+00:00	I do not want to be too rhetorical about it. In the language of law, this is an administrative scheme, with a penalty points system, but fishermen perceive it-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T22:10:00+00:00	-----and want their feelings to be acknowledged that they perceive it as being yet another heavy-handed State intervention.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T23:00:00+00:00	If this legislation is about an EU harmonisation of sanctions, is the 30 days the de facto position across all member states? Is each member state implementing a 30-day regime? If that is the case, so be it; there is consistency. However, we plead mitigation in these circumstances. Given the particular variations in an Irish scenario where fishermen are fishing quite far from their home base, as has been articulated by Deputy Pringle, there is scope to plead for some mitigation to allow for a greater number of days to be provided when preparing one's case, as it were. That is simply what the amendment seeks to do. Is the Government tied to the 30 days so as to be ad idem with the position of other member states or does the Government have scope in how it transposes the EU rules?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-02T23:20:00+00:00	I asked the Minister a specific question so as to seek enlightenment on the justification for the 30 days and he has come back to us on that. I asked specifically whether that is consistent with other member states' positions in respect of preparing cases and whether there is scope, because of the particular conditions that exist in an Irish context, for a moving of that beyond the 30 days. It is really more from the point of view of seeking information that I posed the question. I just wanted to see what the member states' positions were in respect of the 30 days. Is there greater scope for furtherance of that position?
