SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank them for attending.  Have people been personally searched under section 17A?  Have those provisions been exercised in that fashion?  Who are the authorised officers?  Do those authorised officers have the power to bring in the Army to cull herds?  If so, has that provision been used?  Under what conditions would a person be searched pursuant to section 17A?  I am uncomfortable about this issue, due to the rights of the person.  I would like to get more information on it and how it has been used.We are being asked to extend the provision under section 17A for a further 12 months from 8 March under the animal health and welfare Bill.  Is it fair to say that the Bill may take as long as that to come before these Houses?  The Bill was on the legislative programme since this Government's mandate began.  If the Government is repealing Acts that are over 100 years old in some cases, then I understand that such a cumbersome process will take time.  However, as we are well into the mandate of this Government, when will this Bill be before us?  It seems that the clock is ticking and I do not understand how it has not been brought before the Houses by now.  If there are reasons for the failure to introduce this Bill, I would like to know them.I broadly support the measure to provide for the extension, subject to clarification on the powers of authorised officers to search persons.  I am mindful of the fact that if we are a food-exporting nation, then the eradication of diseases is paramount to ensuring our comparative advantage.I am concerned also about the powers that are proposed within the animal health and welfare Bill.  The Minister referred in his statement to provisions to make regulations covering a range of issues.  I would like to know what those issues are.  I understand what the Minister said about the eradication of diseases and he referred to specific diseases.  Within the remit of the legislation will the Minister also extend that power to cover issues such as puppy farming and badger baiting?  Will all of those issues be encompassed within the legislation?  We have been lobbied extensively by animal welfare groups seeking to ban certain practices and it is difficult to know how to respond to them as we do not know what exactly the legislation will contain.  We are in a vacuum in that sense.  I understand that it takes time to codify or consolidate legislation because it is a cumbersome process.  However, the Minister must act with more proficiency to bring the legislation forward so that we know exactly what we are dealing with in regard to all of those issues.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In terms of the question I asked and with respect to the Minister, the answer is not adequate.  He is asking us to extend the timeline of section 17A.  It is fair and responsible of us to ask on behalf of the people under what circumstances have the powers been used, in particular, whether they have been used with regard to the searching of persons.  It is reasonable for me to ask this question and the Minister should not obfuscate on the issue.  I understand why the provision is in place and I am not against it necessarily.  However, I would like further information on whether it has been used to search individuals.  I would have a problem with this and would like a more detailed answer from the Minister.  With all due respect, we are entitled to it.
