SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	I thank the witnesses for attending. They have yielded much information in their presentations and posed many questions, particularly relating to child protection and preventative elements relating to child sexual abuse imagery. What more can parents do to protect children from becoming vulnerable to that macabre world of child sexual abuse? Most children live in protected, loving homes where there is an element of vigilance by parents, but many children globally do not have such privilege. What more can governments or state agencies do to intervene and to protect? Is the law currently robust enough? Is there glaring ignorance - a term which I do not use pejoratively - about the so-called dark web among policymakers like ourselves with regard to what the dark web actually is? Much of this activity allegedly takes place there. It is something that most parents and citizens have no concept of. Perhaps more education is needed. Might I get an answer to those questions first and then, with the Chairman's indulgence, ask one or two more?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	If the ISPAI which Ms Niculescu represents is aware of it, while the State responds through legislation and trying to deploy resources, and if one looks at the innovation cycle and the ability to bypass protocols, is there a sense in which the ISPAI's members have a responsibility to police this activity? If Internet service providers, ISPs, or other providers are the conduit for this type of content, should they police it and ensure that content is not available or is blocked? I am being a bit controversial in saying that because I understand the role of the conduit. There is a sense where many parents or anybody else with a sense of decency who has an interest in this issue would ask the question of why the content is not blocked. Why do search providers such as Google or Yahoo! not just block them? I know it is a very simplistic question but perhaps it warrants an answer.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	Would blocking remove it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	Why not remove it then?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	So the ISPAI is effectively building a file?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:00:00+01:00	For a criminal case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	I have two final questions. I thank the witness for her reply because it was extremely informative. I appreciate her response. In respect of the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, and the Department of Education and Skills, what is the budget for Webwise? How much of the budget is allocated to this endeavour?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	Is that â‚¬740,000 per annum or for the project?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	Over how many years will the programme run?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	On the PDST, how many teachers have taken up continuing professional development in respect of Webwise and Internet safety awareness?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	Is this content included in the mainstream social, personal, health and education, SPHE, curriculum? Is it a de facto part of it? Is it compulsory for students or is it undertaken by choice? Can school principals or teachers say that they have an interest in this area, that they want to take it on board and that they will go for the CPD and teach their pupils about the content? Are the witnesses saying it is not compulsory and that it is not part of the mainstream curriculum?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	I appreciate that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-09-27T11:10:00+01:00	It is not a de facto part of the SPHE curriculum, however. If one talks about, for example, student safety, it is very much down to whether a teacher decides to inculcate this programme within his or her SPHE pedagogy or content. If a school or an individual teacher does not want to subsume this into its curriculum, it does not necessarily have to do so. Should we think about making this a compulsory part of the curriculum? That is the key question. While that is a matter for Government and policymakers, I am sure there is a provision within the Department to have a discussion about bringing this into the mainstream and about every teacher teaching the SPHE curriculum having to include this.
