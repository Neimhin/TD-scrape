[<p eid="para_596">I welcome the Minister's response and I am seeking to ascertain definitively whether he is giving any credence to the idea of introducing a <i>de facto</i> minimum income for every farmer so as to buttress against potential market instability in the future.  The recent volatility in the dairy sector showed us, along with other factors, just how volatile farm incomes are at present and the fact that there will have to be an EU-wide response to this. </p>, <p eid="para_597">What I am really trying to ascertain is whether the Minister is giving credence to the notion of a minimum payment for farmers and, if so, whether there is EU-wide support for such a measure.</p>]
[<p eid="para_600">The Minister mentions the historical model of payments, and I acknowledge the speech he gave to the Seanad recently in which he expressed a preference for the retention of this model.  What I took from that speech, however, was that the historical model would come under increasing attack and that it is not guaranteed into the future.  That is the basis upon which the Minister could state, at least, that there is a degree of stability of income, but it is not necessarily guaranteed to continue if the model changes, unless the Minister states otherwise.  If the historical model changes, will that compromise basic incomes to farmers?</p>]
[<p eid="para_639">The Minister's reply is taken directly from a recent speech he gave to the Seanad.  The own initiative report on this issue was authored by Mr. George Lyon, MEP, a Liberal Democrat representative for Scotland, whose party is a member of the same group within the European Parliament as Fianna Fáil.  Mr. Lyon refers to the desire to go beyond 2020 for phasing in the move from historic to area-based payments and to significant differences in terms of the criteria to be used for the distribution of single farm payments to member states.  As far as he is concerned, it is a foregone conclusion that the historical model will be no more.  I acknowledge the Minister's point that there is increasing pressure for that to occur.</p>, <p eid="para_640">If it is a foregone conclusion that the majority of member states will seek to move away from the historical model of payments, then what is the current thinking within the Fianna Fáil group in the European Parliament as to what will be the replacement?  Is Mr. Lyon speaking for all Fianna Fáil Members of the European Parliament when he speaks about a movement towards area-based payments?</p>]
[<p eid="para_642">I did not hear exactly what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said but I wonder if I can ask——</p>]
[<p eid="para_644">Appreciating the latitude the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has already allowed me, I was just about to state that at meetings of the agriculture committee of which Mr. Lyon is a member, Ireland's position would heretofore have been put forward by the Minister, but that is no longer necessarily the case because of the new structures in place following the ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  It is on this basis that I give great credence to what he is saying because it could be reflective of the position of the group within the European Parliament to which he belongs.</p>]
[<p eid="para_648">I accept what the Minister is saying about the political considerations but I am sure he will acknowledge that George Lyon's position on this issue will be very influential in terms of the final outcome.  I also acknowledge that there are approximately 700 amendments to that particular report currently before the European Parliament.</p>, <p eid="para_649">The key for us at this stage of the process is to try to nail down a more definitive Government position, that is, to ascertain whether the Minister has come to a conclusion regarding the new system for payments for farmers post 2013.  If I understand him correctly the Minister is saying that is an ongoing process and if that is the case, I accept that answer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_682">If we take the three fundamental pillars that will underpin CAP, namely, water management, biodiversity and climate change, an issue will arise regarding the whole pillar of rural development and whether income will be taken from direct payments to farmers and housed in a rural development pillar, which could see it going into an administrative function through various local bodies and development organisations.  Does the Minister have a view on that at this stage?  Has a clear Government position evolved on that aspect?  Would the Minister acknowledge that there are reservations by farm organisations on the matter on the basis that they would not wish to see income being diversified into that area at the risk that it could go down the so-called administrative black hole?</p>]
[<p eid="para_701">If one's solution is to reduce the number of cattle, it is a simplistic way of looking at the problem and one is not looking at the problem of GHGs properly.  That is a scientific view.</p>, <p eid="para_702">I would refer the Minister of State to <i>TResearch</i>, which is a Teagasc publication in this regard.  Perhaps he might acknowledge that looking at the areas of animal genetics, animal management, animal nutrition and performance stimulants would  be a better way to reduce GHGs like methane and that there is a scientific basis for doing that.  Would he acknowledge that any proposals to implement the McCarthy report as it pertains to the scientific budget would have an impact on Teagasc’s operations and on reducing methane emissions potentially in the long run?  We need to take a more lateral view.</p>]
[<p eid="para_733">Earlier, the Minister referred to the consultation process and said that the Commission will publish documentation.  Can Members of this House be provided with an insight into the views of the Irish permanent representation in Brussels?  In that way we could be made aware of how the process is progressing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_744">I did not ask about the sows or the poultry, although I am glad to hear there is something in the offing on those points.  What is the exact timeframe for the Minister to conclude schemes for dairy hygiene, sheep fencing and water harvesting?  On what date will those schemes come into effect?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1298">This issue boils down to some simple facts.  Fermoy Town Council has been instructed to fix a fish pass on the River Blackwater in Fermoy to adhere to an edict from the European Commission handed down on foot of a complaint by persons or bodies unknown on the matter of the impediment to fish swimming up river west of Fermoy.  The local council does not have the means to pay for the repair of the fish pass, which is protected and which the council owns.  The estimated cost of repair is €100,000.  The Department is unwilling to cover the cost of the repairs.  Last Christmas, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, gave Fermoy Town Council until the end of 2010 to repair the damaged fish pass at Fermoy weir to become compliant on foot of the complaint to the EU Commission.</p>, <p eid="para_1299">The Southern Regional Fisheries Board, which may or may not have been the originators of the complaint and which favours the replacement of the weir with a rock ramp pass, when asked through a freedom of information request about its involvement in the matter informed the secretary of the rowing club, Mr. Donal O'Keeffe, that old files were destroyed in a flood in 2009.  In the meantime, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, informed Fermoy Rowing Club last week that he is deeply concerned no progress has been made in the past six months.  He went on to indicate that the rock ramp would definitely happen if Fermoy Town Council does not repair the fish pass.  When informed that the council has no money to effect these repairs, the Minister of State made it clear it is the duty of Fermoy Town Council, as owners of the weir, a protected structure, to find the money somewhere.  The Minister said that he cannot give them money towards the cost of repairs to the fish pass.  However, the Government, of which the Minister is a member, is willing spend a multiple of €100,000 in order to install a rock ramp pass at the behest of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</p>, <p eid="para_1300">Incidentally, there is no indication that the EU Commission has instructed the Government to install a rock ramp pass but it was satisfied that the repair of the fish pass was sufficient.  In the meantime, we still do not know how many salmon are moving up river, because there is no fish counter in Fermoy town.</p>, <p eid="para_1301">We all want to see fish being caught on the rod, and I do not particularly wish to see the Duke of Devonshire taking the lion's share of the spoils below in Clondulane weir, but we must ensure that there is a balance struck between ensuring that fish have safe passage and guarding the future of the rowing club.</p>, <p eid="para_1302">Let the Government assist with the cost of the repair of the fish pass and install a fish counter in Fermoy.  Let common sense prevail.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1309">What about the cost arguments?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1316">Even minor works are unaffordable to the town council.  The Minister of State's response is wholly inadequate and quite disingenuous.</p>]
