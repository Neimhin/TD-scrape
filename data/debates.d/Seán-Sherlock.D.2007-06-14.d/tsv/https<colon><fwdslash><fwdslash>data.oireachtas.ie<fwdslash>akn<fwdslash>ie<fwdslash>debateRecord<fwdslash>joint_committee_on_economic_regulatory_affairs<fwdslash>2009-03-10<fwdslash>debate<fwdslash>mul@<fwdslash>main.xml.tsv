SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, it is midday and Government members have spent the past hour questioning the Governor of the Central Bank.  I ask for equity.  Will the Chairman allow for the fact that the committee has other members?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I too welcome Mr. Hurley and his colleagues to the committee, especially as he is a fellow Mallow man to boot.On what I have heard so far, it seems that the Central Bank has been a largely irrelevant institution in recent years.  If the regulatory authority would have been largely feeding into the financial stability assessment reports, if those reports were being ignored, and if monetary and fiscal policy was being determined by the European Central Bank, then why did we have a Central Bank in the first instance?Coupled with that is the question on the de Larosière report.  De Larosière is being rolled out as the new John Wayne to whose train we all will hitch our wagons and somehow he will save the day.  It is a little incongruous.  My analysis of the situation — Mr. Hurley may correct me if I am wrong — is that where any prudential rules were sought to be put in place over the past ten years, they were fiercely resisted and we and the UK were probably the fiercest opponents of any change in the rules in favour of a more prudential system of governance vis-à-vis the banks.  If a European systemic risk council — a funny-sounding name — will be set up and it will run through the individual regulatory supervisors, I question the role of any individual nation state’s central bank if it will be the regulator that will govern the behaviour of banks in such a scenario.  Perhaps Mr. Hurley will comment on that.Will €7 billion be sufficient to recapitalise AIB and the Bank of Ireland?  Legislation was passed by the Oireachtas two weeks ago.  What role had the Central Bank in advising the Department of Finance on the amount that would be required?  In light of JP Morgan's assessment that bank liabilities in Ireland total €26.9 billion, was sufficient money put into the banks in the first instance?With regard to credit risk, my understanding of economics is that, traditionally, banks could loan on the basis of deposits and they could loan a multiple of that amount.  Historically, the cash ratio was 10% but that went out the window and new rules were introduced at Basel and so on.  The Central Bank became the so-called lender of last resort.  When did that model dissipate?  Where did that all go wrong?  The perception of ordinary people is the central bank of any country is the institution that regulates banks and they haul them over the coals if they misbehave.  Credit risk has defined the crisis in which we find ourselves.  No analysis was conducted on the level of credit risk and banks could lend greater multiples based on the fact they were parcelling off credit risk as a financial instrument in itself.  Did the Central Bank even have the expertise to analyse what was happening with regard to credit risk?  Did it have a role?  Should it have a role in future?  If not, does the Central Bank have a future?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Essentially we are talking about regulation.  The fundamental issue is how the markets will be regulated into the future.  One analysis is that we do not know where we are at the moment, that we are in the morass and nobody has been able to come up with a way to get out of it and start going again.  Even if we start going again we do not know what the nature of that will be.There has been a fundamental rethink regarding how things will be done from now on.  It is fair comment to say that the system of regulation here was weak.  It was weak because there may not have been an understanding of the financial instruments being used by the markets.  There may not have been an expert analysis of what was happening internally within the banks.  If we are to have a system of regulation, what should be the characteristics of a regulator in terms of its interrelationship with the Irish Central Bank?  It seems, if I am to be honest about it, that the Central Bank is blaming the Financial Regulator or the failure of regulation, and that it is saying there is no culpability on the part of the Central Bank.  What it is saying is that it warned everybody through its stability reports but was effectively powerless to act or to intervene because that was the role of the Financial Regulator or the Department of Finance.  I wonder about that interaction and whether or not——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are now seeing an admission by key personnel in the country's finances that there was a lack of knowledge of the financial instruments which caused the explosion in global economies.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Governor for that.  We must learn from the mistakes made and go into the future with a new model of governance.The United States advocates a zero interest rate policy.  Does Mr. Hurley have a view on that?  Should we move towards zero interest rates within the eurozone?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Spoken like Jean-Claude Trichet.
