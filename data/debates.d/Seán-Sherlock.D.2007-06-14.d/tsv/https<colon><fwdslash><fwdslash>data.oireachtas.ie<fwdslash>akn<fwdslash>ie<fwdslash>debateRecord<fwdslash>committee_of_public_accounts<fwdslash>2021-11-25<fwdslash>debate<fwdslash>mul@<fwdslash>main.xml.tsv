SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T09:50:00+00:00	I thank the Secretary General and her colleagues for appearing before the committee. I wish to focus in the first instance on cultural institutions, programme B, specifically subheads B1 through to B15, of the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media Vote. The entire budget of the Department is rapidly nudging up to €1 billion. As a result, I assume that will give rise to many new challenges. Under the Project 2040 national development plan, NDP, there is €460 million allocated to the national cultural institutions investment programme. The projects incorporated into that programme include the conversion of the Bishop Street warehouse into a secure, environmentally controlled archival repository for the National Archives, the National Library of Ireland redevelopment, the development of the Crawford Art Gallery in my native Cork and the proposal to renovate the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Museum of Ireland, the National Concert Hall, the Abbey Theatre and the Chester Beatty Library. The National Museum of Ireland is preparing a design procurement of the history of Ireland galleries. All are laudable projects and are to be supported. However, they will all bring challenges for the Department. The big shift in the spending capacity of the Department in respect of these cultural institutions under the NDP gives rise to a number of specific questions. First, what expertise and systems have increased at Department level to ensure the efficient disbursement of funding for approved capital development projects?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T09:50:00+00:00	If I may, I have further specific questions that may assist the process before Ms Licken defers to her colleague.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T09:50:00+00:00	They are very specific questions. First, who will be responsible for procurement and project management for the capital development projects in the cultural institutions? What is the precise role of the Department, the cultural institution and, where applicable, the OPW in this? Who ultimately manages those relationships? Who undertakes the procurement and daily project oversight? Who signs off on procurement and spending, the Department or the cultural institution? If overspends occur and if the Legislature, through this committee, needs to interrogate certain issues, who will appear before this committee? Looking at the projects I referred to, it is statistically possible there might be issues that may arise in respect of overspends and public procurement that may give rise to questions that have to be answered. If overspends occur, who would appear before this committee? Would it be the Secretary General and her Department or the cultural institution? Furthermore, what additional resources and expertise have been made available to the cultural institutions to deal with this increased oversight and workload? That is just one parcel of questions. There are further questions on this issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T09:50:00+00:00	Who will sign off on the procurement? I want to understand the process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T09:50:00+00:00	Will it be the Department or the cultural institution? The context in which I ask these questions is that I worry that the voluntary boards of the institutions that are earmarked for capital development projects, notwithstanding their expertise on cultural and governance matters, might not have expertise on procurement matters. With this money coming down the track to these laudable projects, I worry that there might not be the capacity within the institutions to be able to have that expertise. I am trying to tease out whether it is the intention of the Department to buttress those institutions with additional skill sets as befit the specific project as it arises. The Secretary General said a dedicated team has been established comprising economists. I would like to be assured whether there are teams of procurement specialists and governance specialists being readied for the delivery of these projects. There is a gap there and it is giving rise to concern. I do not feel assured by the answers so far, if I may say that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T10:00:00+00:00	I thank Ms Licken.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T10:00:00+00:00	I appreciate that. We will examine the matter further as time goes on. I thank the witnesses for that. I want to move on to a quite bespoke issue, namely, that of storage within the cultural institutions. My understanding is that there is a storage facility for the National Museum which is housed in Swords. The National Museum of Ireland's collections resource centre in Swords houses 4 million objects. This is an extraordinary figure. What does the future hold for the storage of the key objects in our national collections, regardless of the institution? I understand that, in the case of the National Museum of Ireland, there are only eight years remaining on the existing lease and that a rent review that was due in September 2020 has still not been concluded. If we are seeking to animate any of the projects I outlined, we will have to decant many of the artefacts or pieces, be they artistic or otherwise, to other sites. How are the witnesses dealing with the issue of the storage of these precious items within our national collections, specifically in the National Museum of Ireland? What are the witnesses doing to ensure there is a sustainable storage facility for the National Museum of Ireland and other cultural institutions?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T10:00:00+00:00	May I intervene? I have 40 seconds left in my slot so I ask Mr. Falvey not to tick down the clock on me. I would like a very specific answer in the 30 seconds I have left.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-11-25T10:00:00+00:00	That is not an answer, with all due respect. I asked a specific question about rent reviews. What was the outcome of the rent review? Can the witnesses assure this committee and the people of Ireland that there will be, from 2030 onwards, a fit-for-purpose, modern storage facility for any collection within the national collection, be it art or the remains of an Irish elk, for instance?
