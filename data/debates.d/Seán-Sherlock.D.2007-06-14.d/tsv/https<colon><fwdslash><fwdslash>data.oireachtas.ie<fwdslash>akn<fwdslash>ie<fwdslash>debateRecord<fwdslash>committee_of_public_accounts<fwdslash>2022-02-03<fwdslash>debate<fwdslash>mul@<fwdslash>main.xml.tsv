SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	I welcome the refreshingly honest answers to the questions we are posing, even if they are not necessarily the answers we want to receive. I will continue in the vein of asking very straight questions. I will start by asking about the N73, especially the stretch between Mitchelstown and Mallow. Has Mr. Walsh ever travelled that road?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	May I cordially invite Mr. Walsh to travel that road as soon as he possibly can? It is only then that he would realise just how awful a stretch of road it is. It is arguably one of the worst national secondary routes in the country. Be that as it may, I welcome that there is an allocation in respect of Annakisha South, Clogher Cross and Waterdyke. I am disappointed, however, that the parcel for 2022 is only €900,000. I am seeking reassurances that a notification will be sent by TII to Cork County Council to give formal notice that Cork County Council can move to go to tender on that project. Is that the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	Has formal notification been issued to Cork County Council?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	Mr. Walsh will appreciate the point I am making. If TII is only allocating €900,000 this year out of a budget line of approximately €10 million, the fear is that Cork County Council will get stuck in the gap.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	Let me just finish the point, which I am making in good faith and respectfully. If Cork County Council gets stuck in the gap, having spent €900,000, but cannot go to tender, it cannot proceed to spend up to the figure of €10 million. I am seeking a commitment that following 2022, we will see the tender issued, boots on the ground, a shovel-ready project and that TII is proceeding with the commitment. That is what I am seeking here.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	Let me reiterate that. TII is issuing the notice to Cork County Council to go to tender and there will be a budget line for 2022 to 2024 that will absolutely deliver that project.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:40:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Walsh. He could not be any clearer than that, which I appreciate. That gives us great hope. I refer again to the N73 and other such projects. Has TII given consideration to the budget line for major schemes in relation to County Cork? For instance, the Ballyvourney to Macroom project is coming in this year at approximately €60 million, or €61 million if one wants to round it up.The perception held by people like me is that the effect of all of the moneys going into the Dunkettles and Macroom bypasses of this world, which are the subject of national priority, is to suck the marrow out of the bone for other smaller projects. I acknowledge that they are smaller roads and lesser priorities, but this means that people like me are fighting on our backs for projects that are in abeyance for five, ten, 15 or 20 years. Is it not incongruous that, if a road is a national priority under a national development plan and so on and it is politically prioritised at Government level, it should have a negative bearing on a local authority's ability, in partnership with TII, to deliver on national secondary routes, tertiary routes and so forth? Does Mr. Walsh believe that there should be a rebalancing of priorities so that Exchequer funding for national secondary routes, which are usually the main routes serving counties, do not get caught up in a Samson versus Goliath struggle where, for example, the N73 is completing with the Macroom bypass?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	The perception is that the rest of the county is paying for these projects.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	That is the perception.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	Fair enough. I will move on. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made mention of the efficacy of relief roads. I hail from the great town of Mallow. There is a budget allocation of €900,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is welcome and we are delighted. It has been a long-running campaign, as has the N73 campaign. These are decades-old campaigns. What will the €900,000 that TII has allocated for the Mallow relief road get us? Once spent, will it buy a further commitment that the relief road will actually be delivered? This is a bit like my N73.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Walsh for his response. I welcome the commitment he has given on the N73. It gives me some hope, but we will have to keep an eye on it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	If he could please give me a commitment that he will travel that road himself-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	Doing that will absolutely and utterly change Mr. Walsh's perception or give him first-hand knowledge of just how bad that road is. I hope it might cause the situation to move more rapidly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T10:50:00+00:00	No, but Mr. Walsh is the chief executive and he carries a great deal of influence.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00	I raised a matter with the Department at our meeting. I am still trying to understand what the future of arts and antiquities storage will look like for the State. We were given chapter and verse on the current regime in north County Dublin, but what I am failing to understand is where future-proofing is taking place, given the involvement of local authorities, local museums, national museums, national collections and so on. Is there anything in the language of the letter that gives us, as per our questions, comfort in respect of the future-proofing of what I euphemistically call the national collection, be that arts and antiquities, statues or anything else? I am not sure that we have been given the answer, but I remain-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00	As the Chairman can tell, I am asking his advice and I thank him for that, but how would it be articulated in practical terms short of bringing someone back to the committee? I presume it would be done via further correspondence from this committee to the line Department.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00	I am in the late fossilised stage myself now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00	I thank the Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00	We can anticipate that there will be an exponential increase in the types of works. New technologies are constantly emerging, which may necessitate the need for a permanent and fixed venue or venues, but we do not have a permanent and fixed venue now. It is on a leasehold basis. I will take advice from the Chairman and the secretariat, as I wish to pursue this matter further. Forgive me if I am slightly ignorant of the facts in this case, but what does a sustainable stand-alone site that is in the ownership of the State and is future-proofed and cost effective look like?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:10:00+00:00	I raised the issue in the context of seeking to understand how each of the line Departments operates its relationship with An Taisce. I thank the committee for holding this item over until this week. I wanted to get a deeper understanding of how the service level agreements operate between nine Departments that are funders through the education silo of An Taisce. When I looked at the 2019 accounts and the various circulars relating to the operation of the relationship between the line Departments and An Taisce, the correspondence coming back to us reflected a concern in respect of seeking clarification regarding the 2019 accounts. An Taisce's 2019 financial statements stated that a change in An Taisce policy will result in a stipulation for a small allowance for organisational costs and innovation in all funding agreements going forward. That set off an alarm bell in my mind because I was not sure whether some of the funding that is specifically for programmes that are well notified to us, such as the Green Flag, Investigate Forests, Clean Coasts and the Blue Flag, was being brought out of the educational silo of An Taisce, which delivers many of the programmes, and into the main An Taisce body. That was the concern I had and I wanted to seek clarification. Based on the correspondence we received back, it seems there are very specific engagements between the funders and An Taisce in respect of buttressing or strengthening service level agreements or reviewing current service level agreements or contracts in respect of that funding. That provides one with a degree of confidence. In the case of one Department, which I think was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department clarified this was not compatible with public financial procedures, stating the grant moneys must be spent entirely on the programmes the Department has agreed to fund within the specific conditions of those grants and that failure to adhere to these conditions could result in funding being withdrawn and possibly the recoupment of unapproved expenditure sought or other legal enforcement. The impression I had was that, quite literally, An Taisce was taking a bit of a tranche of some of that funding-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:10:00+00:00	-----and allocating it to An Taisce, which I understand is essentially a membership organisation. When we look at the delivery of the programmes I referenced, we can see they are excellent programmes and we are very lucky to have an organisation like An Taisce to deliver them. I just wanted to seek clarity on that. Based on the correspondence, it seems individual line Departments are taking a rigorous approach to interrogating that relationship and the 2019 accounts. I am not a financial or management accountant. If An Taisce is a membership organisation, from a public purse and financial probity point of view, do each of those line Departments, the State, the Government or, ultimately, the taxpayer have a right to look at the financial strength or otherwise of the parent organisation when they are funding that organisation?In other words, does the parent organisation have to be in a solvent position before it can receive funds? That is just a curiosity of mine. The reason I am curious about that is because if, on An Taisce's previous year's financial accounts, auditors were saying that - and I am quoting from its financial accounts - for organisational costs and innovation and all funding agreements, that an allowance would be made and there would be a movement of some of the moneys then, one wonders, why that is the case if An Taisce is a financially robust organisation. Hopefully, that can be clarified for me. It may not be within the remit of this committee to have that clarified. Again, I seek the Chair's wisdom on that.  It serves a vital function in terms of the delivery of its excellent programmes, and it permeates out with citizens proactively involved in delivering those programmes. It has built a consciousness and awareness and set of programmes that have had a massive impact in communities at the most local level. It is important that we preserve that and protect it in every way that we can. It does a vital piece of work. However, at the same time, I imagine that we should satisfy ourselves that everything that is being done is absolutely with financial probity in mind.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:20:00+00:00	I would like to hear other members' perspectives.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:30:00+00:00	I have no political agenda to undermine any organisation. I feel I have to put that on the record. Clean Coasts Ballynamona is in my constituency. I raised many a green flag myself when I was a Minister of State. The Chairman will know from the tone of the language of my questioning that it was not with a view to seeking to undermine any organisation. I stated very clearly on the record the great work that An Taisce does in respect of the delivery of the programme but since I am not a financial or forensic accountant, I have to rely on the guidance we receive from the secretariat and the correspondence we receive from the Departments. We are fully entitled, as I understand it, to ask a question of any organisation. I am merely posing the questions and am entitled to do that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:30:00+00:00	However, I do not want it inferred that, because I have asked the question, there is a certain political motivation. I take grave exception to that. It is wrong that it should be inferred from my questioning; it is unfair. I feel aggrieved by the fact that I would be impugned in that way consequent to my line of questioning. My question was asked with a view to seeking clarification.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:30:00+00:00	Absolutely not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:30:00+00:00	Absolutely not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-03T14:40:00+00:00	I used the word "solvency" because I am seeking to find facts in regard to the process as to how this organisation is funded. I do not see how the Deputy is loading the basis by asking that question. It is merely with the purpose of finding fact. For that word to be weaponised now, in some fashion, I think is quite patently wrong. It does me a disservice when all I am seeking to do is find facts. In fairness to the secretariat, it has put together a very comprehensive response. I want to state for the record that the responses we got from the Departments have also been extremely comprehensive. We accept those.
