[<p eid="para_11">I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. I thank the Senator for raising the issue as it provides us with the opportunity to clarify the current position on the major capital project for Holy Family special school, Cootehill, County Cavan. </p>, <p eid="para_12"> The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years. Primary enrolments which have already risen substantially in recent years are projected to rise by almost 25,000 pupils by 2017 and will continue to rise to a peak of over 574,000 in 2018. In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the Department must establish new schools, as well as extending or replacing existing schools, in areas where the most significant demographic growth has been identified. The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, remains the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.</p>, <p eid="para_13"> Holy Family special school, Cootehill, is a multi-denominational special needs school catering for pupils aged four to 18 years with moderate learning disabilities, severe or profound learning disabilities and pupils with autism. Enrolments at the school for the school year 2015-16 are 155 pupils, representing an increase of 24% in the past five years.</p>, <p eid="para_14"> The brief for the project for Holy Family special school, Cootehill, is to provide a new 21-classroom special school and appropriate ancillary accommodation. Planning permission, fire safety certification and disability access certification have already been obtained for the project on the basis of the original brief for a 21-classroom school. In order to complete design stages of the project it was necessary, earlier this year, to appoint a replacement mechanical and electrical engineer to the design team. However, a recent request to increase the brief to provide for an additional five permanent classrooms has been submitted by the board of management. A more detailed report on this proposed increase to the brief has been requested by the Department and, on receipt, this proposal will be considered in the context of the potential impact on the progress of the current project. While the Department is positively disposed towards the increase, the additional five classrooms will, if approved, require an additional planning application and this will need to be further discussed with the school.</p>, <p eid="para_15"> Thereafter, subject to no further issues arising, the project will progress to the conclusion of stage 2b, detailed design, with the completion of tender documents. Owing to competing demands on the Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include this project in the five-year construction programme announced in 2012, as the Senator acknowledged in her submission. However, school building projects, including Holy Family special school project, which have been initiated but not included in the 2012 five-year construction programme will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in the future.</p>]
[<p eid="para_17">I acknowledge the request and will speak to the Minister about the points the Senator has raised. It has been acknowledged that enrolments have increased by 24% in the past five years, which has necessitated an additional request for accommodation. It is fair to acknowledge that the Department is in contact with the board of management and I will raise the matter in person with the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_19">No, I am a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>]
[<p eid="para_21">I was.</p>]
[<p eid="para_26">Again, I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. I acknowledge that this issue was raised by the Senator a year ago and the frustration of the school community which has high expectations of delivery.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">I will continue to deliver it, if that is okay. The Senator might want to check it against delivery. </p>, <p eid="para_29"> The school is currently located on a temporary basis on a site owned by the patron. In the context of increased constraints on the school's temporary site, the Department recognised the need for the acquisition of a suitable alternative site to provide a permanent location for the school. A potential site was identified and following on from a favourable assessment of the site's suitability, the Department opened negotiations with the landowner. Despite the best efforts of the Department and a significant investment of time in the negotiations, these ultimately proved unsuccessful.</p>, <p eid="para_30"> Officials from the Department have since worked closely with officials from Meath County Council towards identifying an alternative permanent site to meet the needs of St. Peter's Church of Ireland national school. In general, the first step in a site acquisition process is the identification of a number of suitable sites by the relevant local authority. The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authority and from the Department. Subsequent to this, a valuation of the preferred site is procured and negotiations with the landowner are opened. Such negotiations may encompass the resolution of complex technical issues and in that context can, at times, be lengthy.</p>, <p eid="para_31"> Once agreement in principle with the landowner has been reached, the legal conveyancing process commences. The Senator will appreciate that due diligence must apply in relation to any site acquisition and in that context the process can at times be protracted if complex issues emerge. In this instance, a number of site options were identified by Meath County Council.</p>, <p eid="para_32">These were comprehensively assessed and the preferred site option in terms of technical feasibility and suitability for development has been identified. Departmental officials are in regular contact with officials in Meath County Council and the acquisition of this preferred option is being actively progressed. The Minister appreciates that the process has taken some time but assures the Senator and those concerned that officials are working to acquire a suitable site as soon as possible for the benefit the school community.</p>, <p eid="para_33"> Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Minister is not in a position to comment further. However, the acquisition of a new site for the school is a priority for the Department and the patron body will be informed of the location for the school as soon as possible. The Minister thanks the Senator for raising the matter and giving her the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position on the acquisition of a site for St. Peter's Church of Ireland national school in Dunboyne.</p>]
[<p eid="para_36">While the Senator has not said anything unreasonable, to be fair, the Department is in discussions with Meath County Council and recognises the need to acquire a suitable alternative site. A process is under way. The Senator has stated the potential alternative sites may not be available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_38">The process under way for the acquisition of sites which involves the Department liaising with the relevant local authority is a process that has delivered sites and new builds and we must have some confidence in it. The Senator's point about the inordinate length of time it is taking is well made and I will convey it to the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_115">I thank the Acting Chairman for his good wishes which are greatly appreciated. </p>, <p eid="para_116"> I speak to the motions on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald. I thank the House for making time available to discuss the motions concerning Ireland opting in to two European Council decisions that provide for the relocation from Italy and Greece of persons in clear need of international protection. As Senators will be aware, Ireland is not automatically bound by EU measures in the area of freedom, justice and security under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which includes the asylum area but may opt in to any measure where it wishes to do so.</p>, <p eid="para_117"> The conflict in Syria has led to the world's largest humanitarian crisis with more than 12 million Syrians displaced from their homes. Of those, more than 4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries. I pay tribute to the role played by Syria's neighbours in their generous response to the Syrian crisis. The numbers seeking sanctuary in Lebanon and Jordan are greater than those seeking to come to Europe. It is an enormous challenge for them and us. Italy and Greece have experienced unprecedented flows of migrants in the past 18 months in particular, placing significant pressure on their migration and asylum systems. Since the beginning of the year, approximately 116,000 migrants have arrived in Italy in an irregular manner and more than 211,000 have arrived in Greece.</p>, <p eid="para_118"> The Government has been working proactively with its colleagues in Europe to ensure Ireland and the European Union respond comprehensively to this critical humanitarian challenge. Ireland has played its part and many months ago we sent some of our naval vessels, including the <i>LE Eithne</i> and, subsequently, the<i> LE Niamh</i> and the<i> LE Samuel Beckett</i>, to the Mediterranean to carry out vital rescue missions to ensure the safety of many people trying to come to Europe for protection. The Minister for Justice and Equality; the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I visited one such mission in Malta recently. Irish Aid, the Government's development co-operation programme for which I have responsibility, has been supporting efforts to assist those affected by the Syrian crisis since 2012. We have allocated more than €39 million to help them within Syria and in neighbouring countries. We have pledged that by the end of 2015 Ireland's support for the Syrian people will reach €41 million. This is Irish Aid's largest response to a single crisis in recent years. Ireland has also contributed almost €2.5 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq since the crisis erupted there in summer 2014.</p>, <p eid="para_119"> Within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and through Irish Aid the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and I continue to monitor the position. Irish funding supports UN agencies and the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, as well as the great work being done by Irish NGOs which are implementing vital programmes in countries neighbouring Syria. They are providing displaced persons with shelter, food, water and sanitation, as well as support to victims of sexual violence. However, the unprecedented scale of the needs has led to a huge strain on neighbouring countries and everyday hardship for refugees. It has also denied refugees the means to build new lives and to see a future for their children. The crisis continues to escalate.</p>, <p eid="para_120"> The decisions being discussed today form part of a package of measures introduced by the European Commission in response to this crisis. The first decision which was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14 September 2015 provides for the relocation over a two-year period of 40,000 people in clear need of international protection - 24,000 from Italy and 16,000 from Greece. The distribution of these persons was agreed by consensus by member states in July and Ireland agreed to accept 600 people under the proposal. Since the July meeting, with the influx of refugees through the western Balkans in particular increasing dramatically, it became clear that significant further measures were needed. Accordingly, at a further emergency Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 22 September, a second decision was adopted which provided for the relocation of a further 120,000 people in clear need of international protection. In this decision, 66,000 of the 120,000 people will be relocated from Italy and Greece initially. The balance of 54,000 people will either be relocated from other member states coming under pressure in future, if necessary, or, alternatively, will be relocated from Italy and Greece. The distribution of the persons to be relocated across member states is set out in the annex to the decision. Ireland has not been included in the annex because we did not opt in to the proposal before it was adopted. It is estimated that Ireland's allocation under this decision will be in the region of 1,850 people.</p>, <p eid="para_121"> In response to the crisis the Government agreed three weeks ago to establish an Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 persons overall under the EU resettlement and relocation programmes. Included in the 4,000 people are 520 we have agreed to resettle in Ireland and 600 who are to be relocated under the Council's decision of 14 September. A further 1,850 people are expected to be relocated under the Council's decision of 22 September. The make-up of the balance is yet to be decided. It is important to note that persons accepted here under these programmes will also have an entitlement, once their protection claims are processed, to apply for family reunification if they wish to so do, thereby further increasing the numbers accepted by Ireland. The 4,000 agreed to is in addition to those who reach our shores directly to claim protection.</p>, <p eid="para_122">A task force has been established to co-ordinate and implement the logistical and operational aspects associated with this programme. The Minister for Justice and Equality chaired the first meeting on 16 September which was attended by all of the main Departments, the agencies, the Red Cross and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR. The people have also shown great generosity, offering support and assistance, including accommodation, to those who may be relocated to Ireland under these decisions. The Red Cross has been given the task of drawing together these offers of assistance in a cohesive manner. On Monday, the Red Cross launched its website to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges. On my own behalf and that of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I express sincere gratitude to the Red Cross for agreeing to take on this substantial role.</p>, <p eid="para_123"> The Government also approved the establishment of a network of emergency reception and orientation centres for the initial acceptance and processing of those in need of international protection who are accepted into Ireland under the EU programmes. In view of the profile of the relocation applicants, it is expected their applications for protection will be processed in a matter of weeks and many will be granted refugee status.</p>, <p eid="para_124"> We have all been shocked and upset at the scenes witnessed in southern and central Europe and the distressing scenes during rescues in the Mediterranean. Ireland has always lived up to its international humanitarian obligations, as is evidenced by our resettlement programmes which have seen almost 500 people resettled here since 2009, our sending of naval vessels to assist in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and the introduction of a Syrian humanitarian admission programme last year which involved 114 people being granted permission to come here.</p>, <p eid="para_125"> By opting into these decisions we will not only provide a safe haven for families and children who are forced to leave their homes due to war and conflict but will also show solidarity with other EU member states whose protection systems are under enormous pressure due to the large influx of migrants. I reassure the House that from a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade perspective, through Irish Aid, we will continue to work with international and Irish NGOs in the particular geographies affected by the crisis to try to support people in their home countries. I commend the motions to the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_199">Not true. We did more than that, which I shall explain later to the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_201">It is not just about the number of people we are taking.</p>]
[<p eid="para_203">I am glad to hear it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_235">What does the Senator mean by saying the United Nations has not done enough?</p>]
[<p eid="para_237">The Senator should clarify the point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_265">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senators for what has been an extensive interaction about this issue. If I read the room, so to speak, I imagine that in the main the Seanad supports the opt-in or the protocol that is to be provided in terms of the Council decisions. I acknowledge these messages of support from individual Members of the Seanad. So many points were raised today and I will do my best to address them.</p>, <p eid="para_266"> I want to nail the lie that the Government has responded inadequately to this crisis. It and, by extension, the people have been involved in it since 2011. If one factors out Syria, one realises the people, through Irish Aid and Irish and international NGOs, have actually committed over €100 million in funding. This has been achieved through multilateral organisations such as UNHCR, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, and international NGOs. In this regard, Ireland has committed a considerable amount of funding, €100 million in total, to seek to ensure there are in-country or in-region solutions and that aid is disbursed in a way in which it reaches those most in need.</p>, <p eid="para_267"> Members will know the UN General Assembly was in session last week and has been in session for part of this week. Ireland continues to support a referral by the UN Security Council of the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court. It also seeks accountability for the multiple war crimes committed during the conflict. However, we all have to recognise that Irish foreign policy is absolutely or partly tied into an EU position, as Senator Paul Bradford stated, but we continue to lobby and hold bilateral meetings with other countries on the need to ensure there is a political solution to this crisis within the region. The need for political stability is paramount. Owing to the political instability, there is a humanitarian crisis.</p>, <p eid="para_268"> It is sad and shocking that it took the image of a small boy on a beach for a political response to emerge. I acknowledge the points made by Senators on the European Union response. I have stated at development Ministers' meetings that the establishment of an EU trust fund still raises many questions about the response. Sometimes at EU level, there is a legitimate critique of the tardiness of the response and of the potential to create duplication in the pan-European response where there is no need for it.</p>, <p eid="para_269"> Last week I had bilateral meetings with Mr. Stephen O'Brien from OCHA and Mr. António Guterres from the UNHCR on the needs of their organisations. With regard to Ireland's foreign affairs response, the scarce resources we have are being deployed increasingly to deal with humanitarian crises and we have to focus on the long-term development goals that actually lead to political stability or enhance political stability in the very regions that we are talking about. Therefore, there is a major challenge for the world. Ireland is seeking to do what it can multilaterally and bilaterally, politically, developmentally and in terms of humanitarian assistance, to bring about greater involvement by the very countries that have been referred to, particularly those in the Middle East, which are not devoid of resources. This is to ensure they assist people within their own regions. A global political response is required. I acknowledge absolutely the points that have been made in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_270"> There is a cross-departmental and agency task force. Its role is to co-ordinate and implement the logistical and operational aspects of the Irish refugee protection programme, which I outlined earlier. I cannot name all 40 stakeholders on the task force because I just do not have that information. However, the Departments of Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Social Protection, Children and Youth Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform, Health, Education and Skills and the Environment, Community and Local Government, city and county council managers, the Irish Red Cross, the UNHCR, Tusla and the HSE are all involved in co-ordinating the reception. The Houses of the Oireachtas have not yet passed the actual motion, but we are working as a state with all the stakeholders to try to organise all the dynamics that obtain when 4,000 additional persons are brought into the country. There will be an increase in that number because of the family reunification element-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_272">I did not hear what the Senator said.</p>]
[<p eid="para_275">We are engaging with the UNHCR. With regard to the in-country response on the ground, there is daily engagement with the NGOs. This is a republic and I am the Minister of State responsible for North–South co-operation. The Senator represents a party represented on both sides of the Border. We have to think of this in terms of the all-island response also. The Senator's party is part of an Executive-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_277">I would love to see a greater degree of visibility in regard to the Northern Ireland Executive's response to this very issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_280">We are doing our best to ensure we have a stakeholder group that will ensure consultation that includes the city and county council managers in order that, at county and city council levels, there will be co-ordination.</p>, <p eid="para_281"> At the first meeting of the task force on the Irish refugee protection programme, chaired by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and held on 16 September, it was agreed that the Department of Justice and Equality would take the lead in the process of relocating persons to Ireland and the establishment of emergency relocation and orientation centres. The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will be responsible for the processing of the protection applications of those persons being relocated here. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the city and county council management network will lead on providing accommodation for persons granted refugee status. The Department of Justice and Equality, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Defence are currently carrying out an assessment of available State properties. The Irish Red Cross has been given the task of communicating with the public and assessing, profiling and co-ordinating offers of public support and accommodation. This has been referred to by quite a few Senators, especially those from the west. Earlier this week the Irish Red Cross set up a dedicated website to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges. The Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection and relevant agencies such as the HSE and Tusla will provide health, education and welfare services and other services and supports.</p>, <p eid="para_282"> Once the 4,000 people are granted status, they will be able to apply for family reunification. That is one of the issues raised. As I said, Tusla is engaging with the HSE to ensure the well-being of children is protected.</p>, <p eid="para_283">The international protection Bill is expected to be published in the coming weeks and enacted by the end of the year. This new legislation will significantly improve arrangements for the processing of asylum applications and greatly reduce the time persons spend in the direct provision system. Today is about getting permission to opt-in. We have no indication as to whether our arrivals will be single persons or families and, therefore, there is still a way to go on that issue. The task force has a specific committee chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to liaise directly with NGOs to provide support services, on which I can provide further clarification. A total of 180 additional staff have been allocated to support the programme. Those who come here have a strong likelihood of qualifying for status and the Government has approved additional staff resources for processing which should lead to a faster granting of status, possibly weeks after arrival.</p>, <p eid="para_284"> The issue of the wording "to the benefit of Italy and Greece" was raised. That is the wording of the Council agreement.</p>, <p eid="para_285"> We all acknowledge that there have been serious deficiencies in the direct provision system, but it has not failed to provide accommodation, food and other supports for all asylum seekers who have come to the State in the past 15 years, which should be acknowledged. From a cross-party point of view, we all openly acknowledge that the Government is trying to rectify the position and, by any objective standard, we have done a good job.</p>]
[<p eid="para_292">I have just acknowledged the deficiencies. I understand the need for rhetoric and histrionics also.</p>]
[<p eid="para_295">We will seek to preserve the dignity of the persons who come to this island and make sure matters are expedited, utilising all the stakeholders involved, including Departments, in order that their rights as human beings are protected.</p>]
