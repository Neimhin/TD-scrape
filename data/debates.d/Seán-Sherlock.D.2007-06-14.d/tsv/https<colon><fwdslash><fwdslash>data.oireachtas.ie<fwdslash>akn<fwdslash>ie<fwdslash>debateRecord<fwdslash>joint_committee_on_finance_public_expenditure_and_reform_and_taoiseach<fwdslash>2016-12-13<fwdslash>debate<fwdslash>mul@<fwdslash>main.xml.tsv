[<p eid="para_39">I thank the witnesses for attending.</p>, <p eid="para_40"> This is quite a complex proposal. I do not doubt there is not a politician across Europe who will have questions about the modalities of the Commission’s proposals.</p>, <p eid="para_41"> One point the Commission raised with the committee concerned the treatment of research and development. It stated the 2011 proposal for full deductibility of research and development costs was a one-off. There was no capitalisation depreciation of research and development over several years. This regime had been retained under the relaunched proposals with the exception of immovable property. What is the immovable property element? Over the past several years, this country has focused on the knowledge box and the research and development tax credit. There is an 80:20 split between the domestic and foreign direct investment sectors. What would be the effect of the Commission’s proposals on domestic companies?</p>]
[<p eid="para_44">Scientists do not like to be called "white coats" at all.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">I appreciate that. The fear we have in this committee is that the work Ms O'Brien just described in regard to creating the research and development regime, if one likes, in terms of attracting foreign direct investment is undermined in any way by virtue of the proposals people would have serious issues with that, while wishing to continue working with the proposal.</p>, <p eid="para_47"> I am trying to get an understanding of the arbitrary figure of €750 million in relation to the turnover and the common base. There is an 80:20 split between the domestic and non-domestic sectors. My instinct tells me that loopholes could be created to circumvent that. Perhaps I am wrong. Does Ms O'Brien have a perspective on that also? How does one calculate the €750 million threshold? It is conceivable that people might not come up to that base for all sorts of reasons or they could be very creative in ensuring that they do not come up to that base so as not to hit the threshold, so to speak.</p>]
[<p eid="para_49">That is fair enough. I asked just to get a perspective and I thank Ms O’Brien for that. That is all I have to say for now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_51">I appreciate that. There is a long way to go on this proposal but it important that we have perspectives on the tax implications for R&amp;D in particular.</p>, <p eid="para_52"> Are other taxation institutes across the 27 or 28 member states flagging these concerns and is there collaboration between the Irish Tax Institute and others on these bespoke issues?</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">I appreciate the Vice Chairman's invitation. I have not yet got a chance to ask Mr. Coffey any questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">I will be just a few moments. I wish to hear Mr. Coffey's view on one issue I zoned in on in his submission, and perhaps he will have to repeat himself. The document states that the European Commission study does not have data on sales by destination and that in this instance, rather than try to impute the location of sales, the study proxies sales with output. Could Mr. Coffey give us a layman's view on what he means by this, particularly for people watching the proceedings of the meeting who are very interested in this subject?</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">Mr. Coffey refers specifically to the pharma sector and the €15 billion impact it has on payroll, supply and so on. He seems to critique the proposal by the Commission on the basis that it only uses company financial data. I do not want to put words into his mouth, but my ears are telling me that the Commission's fundamental proposal is quite flawed, or at the very minimum can be seriously critiqued, because it does not delve into the very factors to which Mr. Coffey refers. A country such as Ireland has a huge dependence on foreign direct investment and notwithstanding global tax justice, all these are issues that are sometimes raised, including the BEPS process under way through the OECD. To be fair, Ms O'Brien is right that we must give that process a fair wind and a chance to settle. However, there could be serious permutations for Ireland's ability to continue to attract FDI and maintain it. The pharmaceutical sector, for instance, has a regional importance in the south, east, west, north and north west. I am not being too parochial; it spans the whole country. If I were in the pharmaceutical sector considering these proposals and if I were a lead on a site making strategic decisions from a corporate point of view, I would be potentially quite worried by these proposals as they stand.</p>]
[<p eid="para_99"><i>Ceteris paribus</i>, as they say in economic terms, if the proposals are taken as they are presented to us and if they were given effect in law that could have serious consequences for our ability to maintain foreign direct investment. It could have a big impact on payroll.</p>]
[<p eid="para_101">I thank the witnesses today because if we can parse or delve deeper into their submissions and use them as part of our response to the Commission before the 20 December deadline it would be very useful for this committee.</p>]
