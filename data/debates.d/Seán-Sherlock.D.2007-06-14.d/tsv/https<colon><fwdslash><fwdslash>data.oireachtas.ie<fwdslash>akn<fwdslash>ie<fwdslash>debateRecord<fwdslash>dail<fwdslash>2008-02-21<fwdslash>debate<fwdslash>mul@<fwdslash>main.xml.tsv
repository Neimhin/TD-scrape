SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Let us consider the impending review of acute hospitals.  Given that hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital, which are currently being downgraded by stealth, are anxiously awaiting this review, will it give rise to a legislative procedure?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In some respects the issue has moved on since the question was tabled.  However, I thank the Minister for her response.  As soon as this issue came to light, both the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and her Department took a highly proactive approach in respect of REPS 2 and REPS 3.Is there a definite timeframe in which a decision will be made on the outcome regarding payments under the REPS 4 scheme?  I understand negotiations are ongoing at present and I take cognisance of the sensitivities associated therein.  However, I would appreciate the provision by the Minister of an approximate timeframe to Members.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister for her response.  As a general point, this is a vital scheme and the income derived from it by farmers is essential to them.  If the Minister has any scope to have the Irish model adopted throughout the European Union, it will be very positive for agriculture in Ireland and the Union.  She might take this on board.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	He will have to get a financial statement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If I understand the Minister correctly, there was retrospective testing since November 2007, but subsequently the Commission regulation allowed for importation from previously susceptible areas.  To my mind, notwithstanding the level of co-operation with the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, that implies the risk still exists — and if testing is occurring post-import, the disease might be detected.  Is the Minister satisfied that every beast will be tested on importation to offset the risk and take into account the fact that the Commission regulation — notwithstanding Ireland's position — has gone against us?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The relevant Deputy will be very impressed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What we are seeing is a consolidation of the growers.  Many small growers are being squeezed and the Government needs to take action to advocate on behalf of the local producers.
