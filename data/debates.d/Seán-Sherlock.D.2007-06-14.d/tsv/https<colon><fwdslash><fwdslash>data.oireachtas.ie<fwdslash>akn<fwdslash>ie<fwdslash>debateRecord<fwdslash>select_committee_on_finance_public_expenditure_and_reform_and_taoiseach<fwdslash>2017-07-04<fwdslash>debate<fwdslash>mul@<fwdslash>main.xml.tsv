SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2017-07-04T14:40:00+01:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Peter Burke. The usual provisos apply to mobile phones and I am now switching off my own. We are joined by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. This meeting has been convened to consider the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017 which was referred to the select committee by order of the DÃ¡il on 1 June 2017. Subject to the agreement of the committee, if Committee Stage proceedings are not concluded by 3.45 p.m., it is proposed that the meeting would be adjourned at that time. Is that agreed? Agreed. No amendments have been tabled.
