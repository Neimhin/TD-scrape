SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:10:00+01:00	I welcome Mr. Gloster and his team to the committee. An article appeared on Monday, 27 September, in the Irish Examiner where Mr. Gloster spoke at length in respect of private provision of residential care. The article stated:Mr Gloster said that many private care placements were working well but added: “The bigger risk of that level of dependency on private care is private operators can leave the market; they can leave quickly, they can sell on; company structures can become very complex, and the reality is that if you have a private provider in a house with four young people, if that private provider left the market, the State has only one option and that is for us to take over that provision there”.Is there a shift in policy in Tusla such that it is going to wind down private care providers? Is that a signalling of a policy shift? What is the real-time position in respect of that? The witnesses might bear in mind that I have ten minutes and there are four questions I would like to ask.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:20:00+01:00	I have a couple of questions following on from that. As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers. A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses. Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services. What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance? It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver. I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:20:00+01:00	I acknowledge that and I appreciate Mr. Gloster's response. Tusla providers are inspected by HIQA but Tusla inspects the private providers on its list.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:20:00+01:00	At what stage does Mr. Gloster anticipate there will be a change in that regime such that the private providers are inspected by HIQA?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:20:00+01:00	I appreciate the frankness of that response. It is about as frank as one can get. I hope the regime will change to reflect it. Historically, the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported significantly on the cost of the guardian ad litem service. We are all mindful that the Child and Family Agency is about providing care for children and ensuring, in a court hearing or any judicial process, that the voice of the child is heard. I am concerned about the costs of the guardian ad litem service. We had gone some way towards legislating for change in that area during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. What is the Child and Family Agency's understanding of the status of the draft heads of a Bill to make changes to the guardian ad litem service and what engagement has it had with the Department in that respect?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-10-21T10:20:00+01:00	Mr. Gloster said in his opening statement: "The agency received referrals to its child protection and welfare service in 2020 at just below 70,000. It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease." Have all of those 70,000 referrals been expedited? Is Tusla on time and ahead of the curve in terms of all referrals that come to it in respect of any child or family?
