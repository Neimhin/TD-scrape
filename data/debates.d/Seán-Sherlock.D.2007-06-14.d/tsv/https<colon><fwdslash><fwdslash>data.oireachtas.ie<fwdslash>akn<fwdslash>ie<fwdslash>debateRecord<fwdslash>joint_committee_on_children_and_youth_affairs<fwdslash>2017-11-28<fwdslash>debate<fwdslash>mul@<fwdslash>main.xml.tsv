Their purpose, according to the report, was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice, to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards. Is that not what HIQA does?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00	The committee has had some consideration of that issue at hand, because it is the one piece we have not had the opportunity to interrogate although, as Ms Dunnion noted, we have sight of the recommendations. Notwithstanding that, I want to understand HIQA's point of view and if she is comfortable now with the cultural and procedural changes and the improvements that have been articulated by the chairman of the board and the chief executive. They have made a submission to this committee and I am pretty sure that Ms Dunnion has had sight of that submission. Is there anything in that submission that has been stated previously that she would critique in any way?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00	On the single separation issue, which I think HIQA adjudicated on the fact that it was not consistently adhered to by staff or management. Obviously there is a process under way where that is being monitored. What methodology does HIQA use? Does it involve inspectors going in and talking to staff, inspecting the physical facilities and so on? How does it actually work?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-28T14:40:00+00:00	What criteria do HIQA apply? Presumably, it will use best international practice. What is best international practice for the purposes of the HIQA inspections? HIQA refers to how the authorisations for the approval of the use of single separation and the extension to the time spent in single separation were not always completed by managers in line with policy. One can overcome that by documenting, time keeping and so on, but one must see the justification in the first instance for single separation. As HIQA obviously has regard to best international practice, can Ms Boyle enlighten us as to what best international practice is?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-28T14:45:00+00:00	The measure of success for those who read the report and examine the Oberstown campus will be evidence of cultural change. I perceive that cultural change is taking place in Oberstown and that it is moving towards a more positive disposition with regard to tackling these issues from a staffing point of view. I also perceive that internal communications have dramatically improved. Are my perceptions correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-11-28T14:45:00+00:00	I do not necessarily expect Ms Boyle to comment on my concluding remarks. If there are real time improvements across all the HIQA standards, it will be necessary for members to see a copy of the Goldson and Hardwick report. It is not enough that we have the recommendations without seeing what is in the body of the report. While I understand that legal issues may arise in respect of the report, if the improvements are taking place in real time, I do not see any reason the committee cannot have regard to the report. We need to have a greater interrogation of the Goldson and Hardwick report. That may not be the correct name but those are the names of the report's authors. We need to see what is in the report because it is a missing piece of the jigsaw. I have no further questions and I thank Ms Boyle for her time.
