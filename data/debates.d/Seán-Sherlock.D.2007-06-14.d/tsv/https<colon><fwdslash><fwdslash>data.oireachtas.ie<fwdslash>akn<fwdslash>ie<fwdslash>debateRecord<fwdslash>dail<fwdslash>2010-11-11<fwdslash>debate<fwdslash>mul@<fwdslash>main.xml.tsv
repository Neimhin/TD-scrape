[<p eid="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the report published yesterday by the European Court of Auditors stating the closure of the Greencore sugar factory in Mallow in 2006 with the loss of over 300 jobs may not have been necessary.  I ask for a debate on the report in this House so the Tánaiste can give an account of the night of 20 February 2006 when the factory——</p>]
[<p eid="para_5">——and an industry that sustained thousands of jobs were sent to their demise.  We still do not know what happened on that night.</p>]
[<p eid="para_7">We have an opportunity today to ask the Tánaiste to give an account of her actions on that night and of why the Fianna Fáil Government consigned an industry to it death.</p>]
[<p eid="para_14">On a point of order——</p>]
[<p eid="para_17">I was first on my feet.</p>]
[<p eid="para_21">On a point of order, will the Ceann Comhairle endeavour to allow or guarantee us some time today to debate this?</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">A number of Deputies have got to their feet to ask for a debate on this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">A number of Deputies have risen to ask for a debate but all the Ceann Comhairle is allowing is an Adjournment debate.  Hundreds of jobs were lost.</p>]
[<p eid="para_38">What we want is a special notice question and time to debate this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_40">This is a matter of political principle and also one of serious importance.  We are referring to a national industry which was formerly owned by the State and which was sold by it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_73">Deputy Stagg and I have been on our feet for the past five minutes trying to raise a point of order.  Will the Ceann Comhairle please respect the fact that Labour Party Members wish to speak?</p>]
[<p eid="para_220">On a point of order——</p>]
[<p eid="para_223">On a point of order——</p>]
[<p eid="para_228">With all due respect to the Tánaiste, I am up on a point of order, which is that we are asking for an account to be given of the night of 20 February 2006——</p>]
[<p eid="para_231">——and the people in north Cork and the former workers are entitled to that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_286">We want to know what way the Tánaiste voted on 20 February 2006.  That is what we are entitled to.</p>]
[<p eid="para_349">We are definitely into the last days of the Roman Empire if Deputy Dempsey is——</p>]
[<p eid="para_902">I suggest taking the Minister of State by the scruff of the neck.</p>]
[<p eid="para_940">I understand that €100 million has been committed over three years by the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, to assist poorer countries to tackle climate change.  Consequently, either the Minister, when responding to this debate, or someone from the Government side should indicate the current status of this initiative to Members.</p>, <p eid="para_941">The content of the Bill has already been anticipated in the joint committee's report.  Members often speak in this House about the partisan nature of politics and I agree it is understandable that in certain circumstances, the House will divide on political or philosophical issues or on managerial issues pertaining to how the country should proceed.  However, an issue such as this, on which a cross-party report has been produced that has been accepted by all political stakeholders and with the Green Party in power, should surely be out of the starting blocks already.  At this point, Members should not only be talking about heads of agreement and so on.</p>, <p eid="para_942">There is a sense that because the economy has taken such a downturn, an issue such as climate change can move to the back burner.  I reiterate a point made by Deputy Barrett by questioning the reason the election of a mayor for Dublin is being prioritised through changes in legislation.  Why does that measure take greater precedence than an issue such as climate change in the legislative programme before Members?</p>, <p eid="para_943">I refer to today's Order of Business in the Dáil and the furore, partly started by me I admit, on the decision by the European Court of Auditors to critique a Government decision on the closure of the Irish sugar industry.  While one may ask the reason this is pertinent to the subject under discussion, I was town mayor of Mallow at the time when the sugar factory there closed and one issue I sought to put on the political agenda was an examination of the potential for ethanol production.  It was considered that if Ireland was moving out of sugar production and if the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries were going to be given a greater slice of the market under the Everything But Arms initiative, then this was a WTO decision to which one would, to a certain extent, be obliged to buy in to.  At that time, I was strongly of the opinion, based on sound advice, that there was potential at least for a survival mechanism for the plant for two years.  Thereafter, once the market had opened up, it would be a case of sink or swim depending on how the global market went.  It is now evident that the global market for sugar has increased but in the absence of the continuation of sugar production at the Mallow plant there could have been a move towards an ethanol production facility.</p>, <p eid="para_944">Timing is everything because this year, the House has transposed the bio-fuels obligation legislation, which seeks to ensure that each tank of petrol has ethanol or alternative fuel sources as part of its constituent composition.  The Labour Party strongly believed that stimulation of an ethanol production market within Ireland was possible but to be able to so do it would be necessary to put in place a set of tariffs.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, rejected this position.  I am not trying to score political points because if I understand his position correctly, he wished to go back to ascertain what would be the Commission position on such a proposal.  Members opposite will correct me if I am wrong in that assessment.  Nevertheless, there is a precedent in respect of ethanol importation as I understand that other countries are placing a tariff on importation to stimulate local production within their countries.</p>, <p eid="para_945">I represent the constituency of Cork East, within which is located the Whitegate refinery.  I am reliably informed that for a number of years, the big oil companies operating at Whitegate have been storing up undenatured ethanol that more than likely has been imported from third countries such as Brazil.  While it is probably derived from former forestry sites, Ireland has not even started localised production.</p>, <p eid="para_946">In respect of climate change, I refer to the attempt to wean ourselves off petrol and to substitute it with alternative energy sources.  One does not do this by allowing big oil companies to control the political agenda, thereby enabling them to meet their obligations under the bio-fuel obligation scheme by imports from locations such as South America because that does not make any sense.  At that time, when Members were doing battle on this Bill, I would have thought the Minister, Deputy Ryan, would have been ahead of the curve.  I would have expected him to play, dare I say it, the green jersey card by asserting that Ireland would stimulate local demand.  This comes back full circle to my point about Irish sugar and how, at a time when Ireland is importing substitute ethanol to put in its cars, it could have an ethanol industry that could provide the same service.  This is where political thinking in Ireland has become so disjointed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_948">We must begin to think more laterally about how to achieve our aims.  We must start by ascertaining where we want to go and what is our target.  Thereafter, we should look towards achieving that target without fear of being perceived to be too nationalistic.  I do not use the word "nationalistic" in the narrow sense by which most people define it.  I mean having some pride in our ability to produce such ethanol ourselves to be able to stimulate local production.  This could then offset many of the challenges Ireland faces <i>vis-à-vis</i> the production of carbon resulting from the importation of substitutes.</p>, <p eid="para_949">On the issue of forestry, the stated Government target in the revised programme for Government is to achieve 10,000 hectares per annum.  At present, I understand that approximately 7,000 hectares is being achieved, therefore, Ireland still is off-target.  Forestry is a productive indigenous sector that has a multiplier into the local economy.</p>, <p eid="para_950">There is a justification, even in these constrained economic times, for continuing the subsidisation of that sector.  If, for instance, a Government can justify the subsidisation of foreign direct investment type jobs, whereby a grant or subsidy is given to a company for each job created, the same logic can apply where we seek to upscale indigenous sectors.  If we are to target climate change, forestry will become a fulcrum in terms of achieving targets.</p>, <p eid="para_951">With the impending budget, I ask the Government to take a look at this again.  Funding this sector will create an economic multiplier that will assist local economies.  I ask the Government to bear that in mind.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1196">I express solidarity with the workers and growers in north Cork, the area with which I am most familiar, who fought tooth and nail and through thick and thin to try to keep the sugar factory in Mallow operational.  They were given a clear indication that the factory had a viable future if efficiencies and changed work practices were introduced.  Having agreed to the changes, the workforce was sold out by the Fianna Fáil Government.</p>, <p eid="para_1197">The Tánaiste, who was the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the time, made the following statement to the House this morning:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1198">Second, as then Minister for Agriculture and Food, I opposed the Commission's proposals, as the Members will be aware and led the group of 14 in its opposition to that reform.  I led that opposition with a number of other colleagues in the European Union.</p>, <p eid="para_1199">There is a disparity between this statement and the minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of 20 February 2006, which state:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1200">The Council successfully adopted by qualified majority the three Regulations on the reform of the sugar sector as set out in documents 5588/06, 5589/06, 5590/06.  The Greek, Polish, and Latvian delegations voted against.</p>, <p eid="para_1201">If the Greek, Polish and Latvian delegations voted against the so-called reforms, only the Tánaiste, who was a party to the discussions in the Council of Ministers and claims she opposed the proposals, is in a position to describe what occurred at the meeting.  Why is she not present to clarify the matter?  She owes an explanation to the growers of north Cork and elsewhere in the country as well as the workers who lost their jobs as a result of the decision taken by the Council of Ministers.</p>, <p eid="para_1202">I remind the Minister that some of the same workers had to wait for more than 12 months for redundancy payments.  I was a councillor at the time and had to seek supplementary welfare payments on the behalf of workers at the Mallow plant, pending the outcome of negotiations with Greencore, a company that had received millions of euro from the compensation fund.  That story was never told because we were in the midst of the Celtic tiger and the Government side did not want to hear it.</p>, <p eid="para_1203">The bottom line is that the former Minister shifted her position from one in which she was in a blocking minority with other countries to one in which she accepted the compensation package.  She owes it to people in north Cork, all those who grew beet and everyone else who was affected by the decision to explain the reason she shifted her position.  That is the least the House deserves in terms of the history of this episode.</p>, <p eid="para_1204">In 2005, I stated that if Ireland was to stop producing sugar, the perfect place to start producing ethanol was either Carlow or Mallow.  Ethanol is now being imported into Whitegate.  The Labour Party tabled an amendment on the biofuels Bill providing for the imposition of a tariff on ethanol imports to stimulate local production.  Despite the presence of the Green Party in government, this measure has not been taken.  If we are not to produce sugar again, we should at least produce ethanol locally to meet the requirements of the biofuel obligation.  The Government must explain the position it took on this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1249">Regarding the night of 20 February 2006, I understand the difficulty for the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in needing to account for a decision taken in 2006 at a meeting at which he was not present.  Therefore, he is reliant on the officials.  Ideally, the then Minister should be in the Chamber so that we could have a full and frank account of what occurred at the meeting.</p>, <p eid="para_1250">Why did the Government shift its position?  While we were considering the matter from the perspective of Mallow and the protection of jobs and a viable national industry, there were grounds for hope because of the blocking minority.  The Tánaiste stated it was a group of 14 member states.  I understood that, under the old regime, a blocking minority consisted of nine member states.  Why did the Government shift its position from a blocking minority of nine to acceding to the cessation of trading as an industry?  Something must have happened.  Perhaps a vested interest intervened because it wanted to take the compensation.  This could have been a minority group of larger growers, the Government or even Greencore, which might have decided that it was going to get out of the industry and applied political pressure on the Government to that effect.</p>, <p eid="para_1251">The question of the golden share and related responsibilities comes into play in this respect.  I understand that the 1990 legislation makes provision for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to acquire a special share in the holding company and to exercise the rights attached to that share.  However, the Minister stated that he had no rights in the context of the share.  Forgive me, as I am not a lawyer or a solicitor, but if the Minister is telling the House that we had a golden share with no rights attached to it in terms of the performance of the company, why did we have a golden share in the first instance?  What was its purpose if we could not influence internal Greencore decisions on the compensation package and the industry's future in Ireland?</p>, <p eid="para_1252">I will tell the House the reason.  The Government did not care about the future of the industry.  Vested interests had sufficient influence in Government circles to tell it to adopt the new negotiating position of taking the money and running.  If we had the support of the other member states, we could have retained a blocking minority.  If the contrary is the case, then the Minister should tell us.</p>, <p eid="para_1253">I refer to the stand-alone paragraph which stated that we had a proficient factory — this is obviously a reference to the Mallow factory in point 30 as the Minister has stated.  Has the Minister been in contact with the Commission regarding that specific point of the report?  What has been the Commission's response to the Minister on that matter and on the report in general?  Deputy Jack Wall has already stated that the decision had not been justified on the risk of lower prices reducing the supply of sugar beet to an uneconomic level.  We did not really know what the true market would be, post-restructuring.  My information in 2005 was that Greencore was going to proceed with production and move into a post-quota scenario and then see how the market would pan out.  This was the impression given to me by senior people within Greencore at the time.  In other words, even if the quota regime was not in place, the industry might survive for a year or two in a new market scenario.  If after that time the industry did not survive, there might be a possibility it could diversify into ethanol and other such products.  I ask for the Minister's view at this stage.  Will I be allowed make another contribution later?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1280">So the Government stitched up the legislation very well in that regard.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1320">It was a scattergun approach.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1347">The Everything But Arms Initiative was something of a fallacy in terms of a justification for the Government's position on the loss of an industry which goes back to the foundation of the State.  The Minister, in his justification, weakens his own argument because the Everything But Arms Initiative and the ACP countries have not found the foothold in the European markets that they were supposed to get as a result of the restructuring of the sugar industry.  The bottom line here is that what was a sustainable industry has been sold down the river but it was let go too easily.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1355">That is factually incorrect.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1357">By the end of year two of a three year process, the voluntary approach was not working and it was coming in under quota.  It was far below the Commission's target in fact.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1359">You are a gas.  You will try any trick in the book.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1368">Who is the Minister quoting?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1370">Who is the economist?</p>]
