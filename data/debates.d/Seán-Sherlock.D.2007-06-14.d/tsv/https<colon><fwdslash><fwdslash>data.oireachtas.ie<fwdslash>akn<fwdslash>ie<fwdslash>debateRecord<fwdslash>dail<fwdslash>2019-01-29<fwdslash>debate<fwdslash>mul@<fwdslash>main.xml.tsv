SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-29T14:50:00+00:00	My Labour Party colleagues and I join other Deputies in expressing our sympathy to the families of those people who died on our roads in the past week. On page 43 of the programme for Government, it is clearly stated that the Government will set out a list of priorities in respect of the development of the Atlantic corridor. There is also a commitment to a 50% increase in capital expenditure on roads. In light of the recent statements he made regarding the reprofiling of the capital expenditure programme and comments to the effect that some projects will be deferred, I ask the Taoiseach to provide an assurance that the M20 motorway between Cork and Limerick will be developed in a timely fashion. In the interests of ensuring proper regional development, I ask him to give a concrete commitment that the M20 project will not be put on the back burner and that other projects relating to it, including bypassing towns such as Mallow, will not be forgotten. I seek assurances from the Taoiseach on this matter.
