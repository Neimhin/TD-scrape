[<p eid="para_22">The members have read the opening statement. We are very much briefed on the opening statement. In order to allow for a concise opening statement and a proper question and answer afterwards, that is why the members came to that conclusion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_27">We have received it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_52">I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee today. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on global warming of 1.5° C as a result of CO2 emissions from industry, pathways limiting global warming to 1.5° C are projected to be approximately 75% to 90% lower in 2050 relative to 2010. That is compared with the 50% to 80% figure for global warming if we are projecting up to 2° C. Will Dr. Quinn indicate the emissions trajectory for Irish industry from now to 2030 and from now to 2050? Will I continue with my questions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">That is the first question. If there is a difference in that respect, how different is the current trajectory in terms of the requirement for industry to cut emissions by more than 75%? I cannot see any specific figures in Dr. Quinn's submission on cutting emissions. I would like to see information from the Department in respect of those figures.</p>, <p eid="para_57"> The second theme also emanates from the recent IPPC report. How will the Department assess the specific actions it must take to lead Irish industry in delivering what we call the deep cuts in overall emissions in the next 12 years? We have gone from a 2030 to 2050 outlook to a 12-year outlook, which I believe will be the <i>modus operandi</i> of this committee. I refer to the recent IPCC report dealing with the 12 years from now. How will individual Departments move towards radical policies across their agencies to target those deep cuts that are so necessary? What specific actions will the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation take?</p>, <p eid="para_58"> On the research, development and innovation, RDI piece, priority areas were noted in the submission. I have some degree of familiarity with those priority areas. How much money is being allocated across those thematic areas, specifically relating to energy, climate action and sustainability, including the decarbonisation of the energy system and sustainable living? What are the names of the research centres? How much money is each research centre receiving? What is the total amount of moneys being received for each of those centres? Is the issue of climate change or radical climate action in respect of the 12 years mapped across the area of food, for instance, in terms of smart and sustainable food production and processing and on manufacturing and novel materials, including advances in smart manufacturing?</p>]
[<p eid="para_73">I have only one minute left. I thank the delegates for their answers, but we only have ten minutes each and I am trying to be as efficient as possible. Could a breakdown of the figures be sent to the committee?</p>]
[<p eid="para_75">On emissions trading, there is a question outstanding about how the model works and the offsets industry can use. It would be useful for us to have a better understanding of how it works and the 100 companies involved. Perhaps we might receive a synopsis of that information or an aide-memoire as it would help the work of the committee.</p>]
