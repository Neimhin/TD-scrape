The Review will ultimately present a Report with a set of recommendations for legislative change.The Copyright Review Committee was established with the following terms of reference:1. Examine the present national Copyright legislation and identify any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation.2. Identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation.3. Examine the US style ‘fair use' doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context.4. If it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended, (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by the European Communities Directives on Copyright and Related Rights and other international obligations) make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting creativity and promoting and facilitating innovation.The membership of the independent Committee is Dr. Eoin O’Dell (Trinity College Dublin), (Chair), Patricia McGovern (DFMG Solicitors, Dublin) and Prof. Steve Hedley (University College, Cork).The Committee conducted an initial consultation process during the summer of 2011 and received over 100 submissions from interested parties.  The Committee held a well-attended and particularly fruitful public meeting on 4th July 2011 in Trinity College Dublin.The Committee issued a Consultation Paper on 29th February, 2012 which sets out the issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in the aforementioned submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties.  The Committee explores various options to address these concerns in the light of the Terms of Reference and the Paper also poses questions on these matters.The Committee has established a further consultation process based on the issues and concerns addressed in the Consultation Paper and are inviting further submissions from all affected or concerned by the issues raised in the Paper including information providers and ISPs, innovators, rightsholders, consumers and end-users.  The Committee also held a further public meeting on 24th March, 2012 for the purpose of facilitating discussion in relation to the issues raised in the Consultation Paper.
