[<p eid="para_1329">The Government's strategy in relation to funding research and development in Ireland through Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is to foster the long term development and competitiveness of enterprise and industry in the State.  SFI was established to build a world class research capability in support of this strategy, and the Foundation has been successful in building human and physical research infrastructure over the past decade such that Ireland has ascended the international rankings for research in a number of disciplines.</p>, <p eid="para_1330">Consistent with Government policy, as detailed in the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, the new Intellectual Property Protocol and the Advisory Science Council's Report on the Sustainability of Research Centres, SFI is seeking to build upon the groundwork already put in place by continuing to invest in excellent research and by engendering greater impact from its funded research for the benefit of Ireland. In this context, legislation is in preparation to enable SFI to fund applied research in addition to its existing remit to fund oriented basic research.  This will not result in the abandonment of its funding of oriented basic research but is aimed at supporting the further development of ideas and new knowledge towards commercialisation.</p>, <p eid="para_1331">Given Ireland's current circumstances there is a need to accelerate the delivery of economic and societal benefits from our investment in research by prioritising resources in areas of opportunity, building closer collaboration between the research base and enterprise and making it easier to commercialise and use new knowledge.  However, we recognise that we cannot sustain this without maintaining the world class research base that we have built over the past decade.  Therefore we must succeed in both maintaining our research base and accelerating the delivery of the benefits of this investment at the same time and within the resources available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1333">The Board of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) appointed Professor Mark Ferguson earlier this year following an extensive international recruitment process. Professor Ferguson has an extensive track record over the past three decades in both the academic and commercial spheres.  Upon joining SFI, Professor Ferguson, as required of all employees, signed the Code of Business Conduct for Employees which sets out in written form the agreed standards of principle and practice which inform the conduct of staff members of SFI.  Incorporated within this Code is an obligation upon the individual to disclose to the Board Secretary any matters that could give rise to a conflict of interest as soon as that conflict becomes apparent.  I have no concerns about Professor Ferguson's commercial interests.  Professor Ferguson resigned as Non-executive Chairman of Renovo Group plc. and Consultant to Renovo on 15th January 2012 before taking up the Director General position at SFI.</p>]
