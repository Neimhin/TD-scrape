[<p eid="para_1035">I will begin by confirming that this is absolutely not a version of the SOPA legislation.  It is a restatement of a position on copyright that the Government has held to be the case.  The Charleton judgment in the case of EMI <i>v</i>. UPC held that Ireland was not <i>ad idem</i> with the EU copyright directive.  We are implementing a statutory instrument to give voice to that judgment and bring us into line with the directive.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 was implemented in the State.  Every member state of the European Union has the right to seek an injunction, in line with EU legislation, in the event of a perceived infringement of the copyright of a party.  Prior to the Charleton judgment, to which we were not a party, our position was that we were in line with EU legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1037">I do not have one.  When Mr. Justice Charleton issued his judgment, we considered it was best to remove any doubt by restating our position, as set out in the 2000 Act.  That is what is before us today - an amendment to the Act to ensure we are in line with the judgment.  Every member state has the right to seek an injunction in the event of a perceived breach of copyright.  Before a judge makes a decision he or she will need to have regard to the e-commerce directive which states there are inherent rights in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to freedom of expression and that the copyright directive provides that an Internet service-provider has the right to conduct a business and to have regard to the right of ordinary users to be able to use the Internet freely and openly.  We would not seek to prejudice this right in any way.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  The State funds new technologies, the development of web-based technologies to the tune of millions of euro annually and we very conscious of the need to continue to do so.</p>, <p eid="para_1038">I take Deputy Murphy's point about the abdication of responsibility.  However, I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that we need to see a dialogue, an engagement, between the Internet service-providers on one hand, the copyright holders on the other side and a space in between for a very highly active Internet web-based community.  They all need to sit down together to chart a way forward.  Personally, I am not averse to the notion of primary legislation but no matter what action is decided upon, we must have regard to the Charlton judgment.  If, prior to this judgment, the State already held that a person could seek infringement proceedings where a breach of copyright is perceived and there have been no sites closed down as a result, we are merely restating what is in the Copyright Act or adding to it, then it is logical to assume there will not be a move to close down further websites.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1040">I apologise.  This is an issue which warrants more time but I will speak again if I may.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1043">That is not what I said.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1047">I reiterate the point that no national authority or court can require an Internet service-provider to carry out general monitoring of the information it transmits on its network.  That gives rights to the Internet service-provider and to the individual IP address or the individual user.  This means the ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  This is clearly stated in EU law.</p>, <p eid="para_1048">We are attempting to balance the right of the copyright holder and to transpose that which is already in EU law and then to recognise the rights of the individual user, the individual business and not to limit the freedoms of the Internet.  Nobody wants to limit the freedoms of the Internet because this is counter-intuitive.  We live in a democracy and we thrive on the businesses we have created in this country, through State intervention and subsidies which support those types of businesses.</p>, <p eid="para_1049">The business model pertaining to the music industry is increasingly and arguably - I will not use the word outmoded - an evolving process.  So long as it is a case of never the twain shall meet, then no matter how one legislates primarily in this field, as soon as one legislates, the Internet, of its very nature, will evolve in a way to circumnavigate the legislation.  In my view, the stakeholders must sit down together in an organic fashion because if they do not reach an agreement then no matter what Government is in power, it will never be able to legislate for this issue.  Given the level of activity on the Internet, which is to be welcomed, and the level of innovation, no one member state, no one geographical boundary, can set laws to try to control it.  This is a commonly-held view to a certain extent.  I think a liberal view is taken, in the main, regarding the power of the Internet and its inherent good.  However, as an EU member state, Ireland must have regard to copyright law.  Anyone who generates intellectual property has a right but that right is not superior to the right of the Internet service-provider nor superior to the right of the individual user.  When governments legislate, they must be very careful.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1051">I assure Deputies that I will give this matter more study.  We will be implementing the statutory instrument, I will be very straight about that-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1053">It is imminent.  I cannot give the Deputy an exact time but a note will be prepared for Cabinet.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1055">I will have to defer to the Chief Whip's office in that regard.  The central point is that those people within that community need to start coming together.  The ISPs and the music industry people need to sit down with each other.  They have been tinkering around the edges of this issue for a long time.  Ireland needs to take a strategic view as to how it pitches itself-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1057">-----in terms of legislation.  I apologise for going over my time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1062">A Chathaoirligh, I did not write a speech.</p>]
