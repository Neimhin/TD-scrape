[<p eid="para_111">I welcome the reply from the Minister of State and my response will be very brief.  Does the FEPS encourage the growth of native woodland?  Will the Minister of State potentially consider an additional premium for those farmers, landowners or forestry owners who wish to grow more forestry on the basis that it would reduce CO2 emissions for this country?  Perhaps an additional premium could be given to those farmers who are not already growing forestry but who may potentially embark on growing it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_115">I accept the Minister of State's answer but there is potential to give a further premium purely on the basis there is room to have carbon off-setting, for want of a better expression.  There is major scope for the private sector to become involved in forestry.  As I understand it, to date there is less than 20% involvement of the private sector in forestry and it is an area of agribusiness that has even more potential.</p>, <p eid="para_116">I am not convinced the €7,604 per hectare payment, the maximum, is adequate given that one would have to operate on large economies of scale in order to get some sort of a decent return.  Many smaller forestry owners do not currently have the economies of scale to be able to thin back forests to allow for greater potential.  The cost of thinning and maintenance would eat into the premium.</p>, <p eid="para_117">We are trying to make a case, in essence, for more grant aid or financial incentives to be provided.  Will the Minister of State consider that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_138">Perhaps we should consult the churches on this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_140">It is an ecumenical matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_202">That is a cod if I ever heard one.  It is rubbish.</p>]
[<p eid="para_224">I suppose the Minister of State's next press release will be expounding the virtues of organic manure.</p>]
[<p eid="para_226">The chickens are coming home to roost following the loss of IFI, which has resulted in increasing costs for importing fertiliser.  We do not know the exact content of fertilisers imported from third countries because there is no policing of urea and other contents.  The Department should put in place some policing mechanism to ensure the content is what it says on the tin.  This has permutations for growers and crop production generally.</p>]
[<p eid="para_236">What about third countries?</p>]
[<p eid="para_316">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the proposal to reduce to two from three the number of consultants operating in Mallow General Hospital, resulting in a dramatic reduction in surgical services from seven days to five days with the further increase in the workload of Cork University Hospital; and the need to debate the fact that this decision was taken without prior consultation with staff at either hospital, the net result being an increase in numbers presenting to CUH, which is ill-equipped to deal with the increased throughput, and the potential increase in the dangers to those served in the catchment area of Mallow General Hospital.</p>]
