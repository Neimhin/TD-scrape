SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-05-31T20:00:00+01:00	On a point of order, I wish to assist the Deputy. There was no Minister with responsibility for labour affairs in the last Government until quite late in its term. The Bill was introduced during the lifetime of the last Government. I hope that is of assistance to the Member. This is a non-partisan debate.
