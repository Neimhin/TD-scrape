[<p eid="para_601">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_602">The State Examinations Commission was established as an independent agency in 2003 to deal with all operational issues relating to State examinations.  The Minister does not have a role in the selection criteria for the appointment of superintendents of State examinations.  The State Examinations Commission has provided me with the following information.  During the period of the written examinations each June much of the integrity of the examination process depends on the manner in which superintendents perform their assigned tasks.  It is a critical role, one that has been performed with excellence, skill and dedication by thousands of superintendents during the years.</p>, <p eid="para_603">Superintendents have a range of important duties during a three week period in June.  These include the safe custody of the examination papers and completed examination scripts and the safe and proper conduct of each day's examinations in line with the rules and procedures laid down by the State Examinations Commission.</p>, <p eid="para_604">Some 4,700 superintendents have been appointed by the State Examinations Commission to almost 750 second level schools for the 2012 examinations.  This does not include almost 9,000 superintendents appointed locally by schools, mindful of the specific needs of each individual student, to supervise students with special educational needs.  Typically, examination superintendents are drawn from the pool of unemployed, serving and retired teachers.  They are appointed each year by the State Examinations Commission through public advertisement in the national newspapers, by issuing last year's superintendents with an application form and providing supplies of application forms for all post-primary schools.  Examinations centres can accommodate up to 50 examination candidates.</p>, <p eid="para_605">In the main, the State Examinations Commission appoints experienced teachers as examination superintendents.  There is a long-standing policy of appointing unemployed and substitute teachers before drawing on other applicants.  It is considered that teachers' classroom management skills and experience of working with young people are equally required for the effective conduct of the examination superintending duties.  For reasons of examination integrity, superintendents are not assigned to their own school, any school in which they have taught in the previous five years, any centre in which they have a relative sitting an examination or within a 16 km radius of their home address.</p>, <p eid="para_606">I hope I have responded adequately to the Deputy's concerns.</p>]
[<p eid="para_611">I have full sympathy for the point made by the Deputy.  While he makes a logical and cogent case, if I am to be honest, we must speak to the independence of the State Examinations Commission in terms of the role of superintendents and so forth.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  The Minister for Education and Skills made statements on the role of retired teachers.</p>, <p eid="para_612">I respectfully ask the Deputy to put down a parliamentary question in respect of getting those numbers.  If he would like to communicate with me afterwards, perhaps we can discuss a mechanism by which this issue should be raised with the State Examinations Commission, so as to allow for a situation to exist whereby the person who wrote to the Deputy would at least have some sort of a chance, having applied for five years in a row, if I understand the Deputy correctly.  That throws up a particular scenario which, on the basis of common sense, should be raised as an issue.  There is a public issue involved and I have sympathy with the case the Deputy is making.</p>, <p eid="para_613">I will talk to the Minister about this.  If it is an independent commission then there may be issues about how to approach it and the commission's clear and unambiguous role in this.  However, I certainly have sympathy for the view expressed.  I do not see why we cannot have - at the risk of being accused of ageism - younger, part-time teachers taking up these roles on an annual basis.  I will talk to the Deputy afterwards.</p>]
[<p eid="para_620">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  He says we all agree that savings need to be made.  If he agrees with that premise, then it is not enough to suggest that he change the pupil-teacher ratio without providing an alternative to make savings.</p>, <p eid="para_621">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the budgetary measure relating to the staffing of small primary schools, to which I assume he is referring.  There is no scope in this year's departmental budget to reverse this measure or indeed any of the budget measures concerning teacher allocation at second level.  Furthermore, the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million, and €147 million for 2014.  There are no easy solutions to this challenge.</p>, <p eid="para_622">The Government has protected education as much as it can.  Far greater reductions in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools, but there are limits on the number of teaching posts we can afford.  In the case of primary schools, there is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level.  However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  As part of the budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.</p>, <p eid="para_623">The schools concerned are those with four or fewer classroom teachers with enrolments of fewer than 86 pupils.</p>, <p eid="para_624">All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  With the notable exception of those Deputies who are in larger conurbations, we all represent constituencies where there are strong and viable rural communities, so we are very conscious of this issue as well.  The small schools will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>, <p eid="para_625">The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.  Even after all these budget measures are implemented, small schools will, in relative terms, be better staffed than medium to larger schools, which are currently operating at a general average of one classroom teacher for every 28 pupils.</p>, <p eid="para_626">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by the Department.  The Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the 73 small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  These schools will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's staffing circular that is published on the Department's website.  The appeals board meeting is taking place this week and schools will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>, <p eid="para_627">A value for money examination of small schools, to which the Deputy referred, has been carried out and the Department expects to publish the analysis and findings of that in the near future.  I hope this report will foster constructive engagement both in the Oireachtas and among all interested parties in examining the challenges ahead and how best to provide for primary education in rural and dispersed communities.</p>]
[<p eid="para_634">With due respect to the Deputy, if he wanted to speak about a particular school in his constituency, I respectfully suggest he should have put that into wording of the text of the matter.</p>, <p eid="para_635">I reiterate that the unallocated deficit in the education budget for 2013 is €77 million and it is €147 million for 2014.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, he said that there is a school in his constituency that is bursting at the seams and he asked why do we not take some of pupils out of that school and populate a smaller school in the constituency with them.  We are not in the business in this country of engineering solutions whereby we would go into people's houses and say they must put their son or daughter into a particular school because one school is bursting at the seams and another one is just about thriving.  We do not interfere with parental decisions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_637">We do not interfere with parental decisions as to where they decide to send their children to school.  That would set a dangerous precedent if that is what the Deputy is suggesting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_639">If the Deputy is talking about taking pupils out of schools and putting them into other schools, he is setting a dangerous precedent.</p>]
[<p eid="para_641">Parental choice as to where one sends one's child to school is paramount.  It is important we recognise that within this State.</p>]
[<p eid="para_643">There is not much else I can say.  I have said it all.</p>]
[<p eid="para_947">Will the Deputy yield for an interjection?</p>]
[<p eid="para_950">Would the Deputy acknowledge that the Commission is comprised of Commissioners who are there by virtue of mandates they received from their respective Governments?  If the European Union member states keep electing right wing or centre right governments in the main, then there will be a right wing or neoliberal agenda in terms of how the Commission does its business.  Would the Deputy also acknowledge we now have a co-decision procedure where directly elected parliamentarians in the European Parliament co-decide with the Council of Ministers and with the Commission, and more and more of that agenda is done on a co-decision procedure in terms of the competences of the European Union?  Would she not agree also that the Stability and Growth Pact is something we have already signed up to, is laid down and was agreed by the citizens of Europe?</p>]
[<p eid="para_967">The argument is no use if no alternative is proposed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_969">I spoke through the Chair.</p>]
