diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of digital electronic equipment made by or on behalf of the manufacturer.”.</p>, <p eid="para_159">This amendment is grounded in the right to repair movement. We are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. One need only visit a local civic amenity site on a Saturday morning to see piles of electronic waste or look at the number of mobile phones that we all have lying in drawers at home and that are beyond use. The amendment is grounded in the idea that we protect the right to repair and ensure that we are part of the movement that fights back against the idea that global companies can build planned obsolescence into products. By passing this amendment, we will fight back against the idea that we should be sold products by some of the world's largest companies knowing full well that they will only last a couple of years. Having built in that obsolescence, we as consumers should have the right to repair the same products. I am speaking specifically about smartphones and tablets, but we are also seeing it now in Kindles, coffee machines, large household appliances and the whole panoply of products that are sold to consumers.</p>, <p eid="para_160"> The Minister of State will tell us that we should not be moving ahead of prospective EU legislation but, by accepting the amendment, there is an opportunity for him to be radical and for Ireland to become a leader in ensuring that we as consumers build in the right to repair the products sold to us as we see fit, that consumers are not penalised and that the same conglomerates do not go after entities that repurpose or refurbish iPhones or, to keep this generic, smartphones.</p>, <p eid="para_161"> My amendment will not be accepted, so I am anticipating that I will be revisiting this matter on Report Stage. In anticipation of the Minister of State's response, I will not be pressing the amendment, but I wish to keep it on the agenda. We need to ensure that we fight back. I am sick of the fact that if I purchase an iPhone, the software architecture of which allows the hardware to work with the Houses of the Oireachtas, email, WhatsApp and all of the other software that we need to survive in the modern world, that piece of kit will last less than five years or, if I am lucky, five years. Processes and the software start slowing down after two years and the battery cannot be replaced. There is no means by which someone can continue using the product for which he or she has shelled out considerable amounts of money.</p>, <p eid="para_162"> People are sick of the fact that they are sitting on a mountain of this electronic detritus. They are sick of the fact that phones are locked or bricked, to use that term. They want to buy products that are recyclable, repairable and designed to last longer, and that is essentially what this amendment, as long winded and all as it is, is about.</p>, <p eid="para_163"> I see no reason to say anything else. I wish to hear what the Minister of State has to say on my amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_170">I sometimes feel – I would have been accused of this in the past as a Minister of State – that we are perhaps hiding behind EU rules. However, I think there is an opportunity within the amendment not to fall foul of EU rules, because we are merely giving an additional right to the consumer to have that which they have purchased in good faith to be repaired. The amendment describes a particular element. It reads: "In relation to equipment with an electronic security lock or other security-related function, the manufacturer shall make available to the owner and to independent repair providers, on fair and reasonable terms and through secure data release systems where appropriate, any special documents, tools or parts needed to disable the lock or function, and to reset it, for the purposes of diagnosis, maintenance or repair of the equipment."</p>, <p eid="para_171">I do not see how that is injurious to the rights of the manufacturer in terms of fair competition rules from an EU point of view or maximum harmonisation rules. Again, I know the Minister of State is frankly not of a mind to accept the amendment. If I understand the Minister of State correctly, he is sympathetic to what the amendment seeks to do. However, at a time when we are talking about the circular economy - there is legislation before us on that very issue - I think people are just absolutely fed up with the idea of built-in obsolescence. I think we have crossed the Rubicon of people’s patience around it. This amendment, in its own small way, seeks to push back against this rampant consumerism. The Minister of State said he will repair and fix shoe leather and I am of a similar mind. There is a strong movement around people not necessarily wanting the best, new or shiniest, but wanting to repair, reuse and recycle. Longevity is a key thing now in terms of products that we purchase.</p>, <p eid="para_172"> I will withdraw the amendment. However, I seek to submit it again or have it revisited on Report Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_423">I move amendment No. 107:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_424">In page 103, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_425">“(4) (a) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, where a trader supplies a service to subscribers, it is an unfair term of the contract under which the service is provided if the trader, in relation to provision of the same or substantially the same service, charges consumers who are renewing their subscription a higher fee than the trader charges consumers who are new subscribers.</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_426">(b) In <i>paragraph (a)</i> “subscriber” means a consumer who receives a service from a trader pursuant to a contract where, on payment of a periodic fee, the contract with the trader under which the service is supplied is successively renewed or rolled over, whether the fee is calculated solely by reference to a period of time or by reference to the amount of service received during that period, or by a combination of both; and “subscription” shall be construed accordingly.”.</p>, <p eid="para_427">The essence of this amendment is that it is a ban on penalising loyal customers more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers. It goes back to the theme of the previous amendment, which basically buttresses the rights of consumers, which is what the legislation is about. We have seen in the past, however, the practice whereby customers of long standing find themselves at a price disadvantage relative to new customers where one seeks to attract new customers to a service, whether a digital service, an online service or whatever else that service may be. From a consumer rights point of view, it is a matter of ensuring, as I said, that loyal customers are not penalised more for renewing a subscription than the price offered to new customers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_429">And I see where the Minister of State is going.</p>]
[<p eid="para_432">I thank the Minister of State for his response. He has left the door ajar for me on this. On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment with a view to resubmission on Report Stage, pending further discussion, as offered by the Minister of State.</p>]

[<p eid="para_558">The justification for the amendment is the lived experience of consumers who take out contracts, with broadband providers in particular. Often, the consumer purchases a broadband product, such as fibre to the home or a copper line, that is advertised as providing 1 GB but it provides less than that and there are dropouts and blackouts in the service provision. The consumer might pay €80 for that. I raised this on Second Stage. I know there is a withholding arrangement built into the legislation in relation to moneys. I fully accept that I may not be on the right track here so I have an open mind on this matter. I am trying to ensure that, where the consumer goes through all the steps with the provider and where it is found that the trader did not adhere fully to the legislation, there is a stick built in whereby the provider will become guilty of an offence. We have enough anecdotal evidence based on our own experiences as public representatives of services having failed people where there is a contract to supply. I am open to correction on this but there do not appear to be sufficient penalties built in to ensure manners are put on the providers. This amendment seeks to provide some remedy for the consumer, as well as some penalty for the provider. Most people's experiences are positive and that is fully acknowledged. Establishing a scheme that is unambiguous in its nature will provide a clear charter, for want of a better expression, to the consumer and the provider where there is an absolute understanding of the expectations on the provider or the trader. That is where I am coming from. ComReg is overloaded and is not resourced. Let us call a spade a spade. We know that so let us acknowledge that. There are not enough personnel in ComReg and policing these issues has been a perennial problem. People will be reluctant to withdraw a part of their payment for lack of a service if they do not feel there are enough protections built in.</p>]
[<p eid="para_560">I will withdraw the amendment but I might come back to it on Report Stage.</p>]
