[<p eid="para_41">I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution.  There is much to digest with axis 1 and axis 4 in respect of what the roll-out of the new programme will mean.  If I understand the Minister correctly, axis 4 will deal with the administrative costs of dealing with axis 3.  The cost of administration and the black hole, which arguably administration has become in some parts of the country, could be tested, quantified and qualified in this context and I welcome a distinction between the two.</p>, <p eid="para_42">Should this programme be examined in the context of the CAP health check, which I understand will shift investment from direct subsidisation into what Commissioner Fischer Boel refers to as developing the rural economy and rural development, what impact will the programme have on the EU CAP health check proposals?  Are the two interlinked?  Are they coincidental?  Will the Minister give us an insight into this?</p>, <p eid="para_43">In my area of north Cork, Avondhu Development Group proposes to amalgamate with Blackwater Resource Development.  Avondhu Development Group provides social inclusion programmes and this will be married with rural development programmes.  What is the natural synergy between these groups?  Will the focus shift towards rural development predominantly in the context of the proposals before us?</p>, <p eid="para_44">The constituency I represent is reflective of many rural constituencies throughout the country.  Programmes such as this have wonderful aspirational views of community centres, leisure facilities and diversifying farm income into tourism.  Not every farmer will be able to provide a tourist product and not every person who benefits from it will be able to travel on a road that is adequate.  My point is that roads in north Cork are in great need of investment but are completely underfunded.  The position is the same throughout County Cork.</p>, <p eid="para_45">If we discuss the development of a rural economy and infrastructure we must discuss adequate funding for local authorities, either managed by local authorities or co-funded through this programme with local authorities to ensure the infrastructure, including water, roads and sewerage, is there and that it is adequate, prior to discussing value-added projects.  I would heartily welcome the Minister to the part of the country I represent to travel some of the roads I must travel, which are starved of funding.  It is not right to discuss proper rural economy and society without also discussing the facilities provided in that regard.  Will the Minister give us his views on this?</p>, <p eid="para_46">With regard to improving the quality of life in rural areas, we have a demographic of people who have lived in rural Ireland all their lives and who have farmed and inter-generationally lived in a rural economy or society.  We also have people who are originally of an urban mindset who move into a rural economy, which changes the dynamic.  How does the Minister propose to change and enhance the quality of life?  What practical programmes does he envisage will bring this about?</p>, <p eid="para_47">I welcome the proposals on funding for community-based facilities, but they need to be teased out a little further.  However, there is still a major deficit and the danger is that much of this funding will go into administration.  We want to see real change and real value added.</p>]
