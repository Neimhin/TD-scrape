[<p eid="para_28">I welcome Mr. Moynihan to the joint committee.  I will first make a number of basic, broad points.</p>, <p eid="para_29">We are witnessing how capitalism is being redesigned.  I do not say this in an ideological manner.  The Anglo-Saxon model to which Mr. Moynihan referred has been effectively turned on its head.  We are still in a state of flux and no one knows what new model will emerge from the current system.  We have the Japanese and Korean model of capitalism, the Anglo-Saxon model and the German model.  While Germany has been affected by the financial crisis, it has not been to the same extent as other models.  The German federal structure allows for a system of banking which ensures regulation is tight.  I ask Mr. Moynihan for his opinion.  Could Ireland use the German model?  Will he also, in broad strokes, give a view on how we should develop a regulation model which would insure us against shocks such as those we have seen in the recent past?  I accept, however, that no model will be perfect.</p>, <p eid="para_30">When the internal auditors of Anglo Irish Bank appeared before the joint committee recently, members sought to question them on loans to directors and the fact that loans could be made to directors with impunity.  How do we change relationships between internal audit committees, credit control committees and boards of directors who pass loans of a certain nature?  How do we tighten such practices?  Regulation is needed to grapple with these issues.</p>, <p eid="para_31">The European Union, in the Jacques de la Rosières report, has produced a set of recommendations.  Heretofore, the British were outside the tent in reaching political agreement at EU level on European regulation.  This was mainly due to the city of London.  It appears, however, that it will, through the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Alastair Darling, get on board and accept a European model of regulation.  Can the Oireachtas introduce legislative measures to ensure Ireland stays on the curve or will the European Union be ahead of the curve?  Should we accept the EU model in its entirety?  What can we do to ensure our regulatory framework is at least compliant with the European Union model?  I would like also to get a sense of what is happening in Europe, if Mr. Moynihan has an opinion on that.  I will leave it at that for now because there will be many questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_141">The Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2009, currently making its way through the Houses, gives the Government, through the reserve fund, the power to take a stake in the specified institutions through preference shares.  Does Mr. Moynihan expect there will be a return for the State on this investment in the coming years?  The results posted by AIB this week include a reference to potential loan write-downs of more than €8 billion.  It seems likely, therefore, notwithstanding the Government's undertaking to recapitalise each bank to the tune of €3.5 billion, that the banks in question may be caught short.</p>, <p eid="para_142">The view of the global financial markets is that Irish banking stocks are untouchable.  In this context, the measures the Government is taking are not necessarily being recognised as positives.  It seems more must be done if confidence in our banks is to be restored.  Aside from the regulatory issues, therefore, there is the question of why the markets do not necessarily view the recapitalisation measures as a positive development.  If they did, there would have been some increase in the share price in recent days.</p>, <p eid="para_143">I am interested in Mr. Moynihan's views on nationalisation.  What would be the logical conclusion of such a process?  If, for example, AIB were to be nationalised, what signal would that send to the markets in terms of how Ireland is conducting its business?  Given that nationalisation requires the suspension of shares, what impact would that have on a bank's ability to fund debt into the future?  If the taxpayer is to own 100% of the banks, can those banks continue to operate within the market in the same manner as they have done heretofore?</p>]
