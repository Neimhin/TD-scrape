[<p eid="para_24">I thank our guests for their submission. It was very well researched. This is the first time I have seen some sort of crystallisation of the issue of vulnerability among that cohort of about 10,000 people, including the 1,274 in the 18-to-24-year-old category. They come to us, as public representatives, and they present in some way, shape or form but we just do not know how to deal with the issue. There is no playbook for any Deputy or Senator for dealing with that cohort of people. If they have been in the care system, there is no transition, and if they have not and they are identified as having had, as Mr. Stanley noted, an adverse child experience, they just fall through the gaps. When I talk to local authorities, there does not seem to be a solution there either. The question is how we can help these people transition and what our guests have come up with is, potentially, a way forward.</p>, <p eid="para_25"> Are they confident they can get sufficient traction with this strategy such that resources will be provided, given this will be about resources following on from their organisation's advocacy? Can we sort it out? Is there a sympathetic ear at departmental level?</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">I am not sure how much time I have. The Galway example involves placing people in accommodation. What is the real-time experience of somebody who presents to a local authority, for instance, where he or she has to fill out a housing application form and go through this bureaucratic process?</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">Is it known by people on the ground that there is a front door they can go through?</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">I went to college in Galway. I always found the Galway people industrious and when it came to finding solutions to problems, that people came together.</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">The mighty Corrib unites them. I am fascinated that they have developed a model where all of the stakeholders are willing partners and they have been able to find accommodation and to have the wraparound supports. How could I get this service going in Cork, for instance, which is where I am from? I could see some challenges in breaking down the silos between all of the constituent partners that would be needed to come together on this. Although not insurmountable, these are challenges nonetheless. Have the Simon Community carried out research, either academic or their own, around the results and the follow-ons of individuals coming through the system? How they are getting on now, because I would love to see this model replicated? If I, as a public representative, could guide somebody into such a service, that would be meaningful for me instead of having to go through the usual frustrations that we experience as Deputies trying to advocate for our own people.</p>, <p eid="para_96"> I would love to take their model. I would love to engage in the research that they have carried out, if any, and bring it to Cork, for instance, and say that here is a model and it works. It would force people to shake off their own preconceptions about young people who are presenting to them because often their experience is not a good one. Ms Feeney crystallised it for me perfectly in terms of the snakes and ladders. When somebody is vulnerable, it is easy for me to talk as I have the capacity to advocate for myself. Not everybody else does and they need those support. What is their perspective on how we could replicate this model and get the political buy-in for that? I would welcome their views on that. It is a big question and I am sorry for that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">I would like to hear more about UCC.</p>]
[<p eid="para_105">Can I presume that Mr. Finnerty would be more than familiar with the model in Galway?</p>]
[<p eid="para_158">I welcome our guests. I want to speak about foster carers. I received correspondence from a foster carer who is also a social worker. She wrote to me in a private capacity. In her letter she states her worry is that many foster carers will not be able to continue to do what they do and that it will not be affordable for people to consider becoming foster carers, especially as fostering impacts on a carer's ability to be available for other paid work. She has layered much more into the letter but this is the kernel of it for me.</p>, <p eid="para_159"> Mr. Gloster has stated that Tusla's strategic plan on foster care services was approved by the Tusla board on Friday, 30 September 2022. I will reflect some of what I have heard from foster carers about the letter issued to them. They found the letter extremely patronising. It is important that Tusla hears this because it is what I have been hearing from foster carers. They engaged in what they thought was a meaningful process after which one of the recommendations was an increase in allowances and financial and other supports. This is highlighted in the letter from Tusla to them. Mr. Gloster and Ms Duggan said they heard loud and clear what the foster carers said. The budget came after this. All that arose for foster carers from the budgetary process, in which I assume Tusla was directly involved with its parent Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was an allowance of €325 or €350. Did Tusla, through its parent Department, make a specific recommendation that the allowances to foster carers should be increased in budget 2023?</p>]
[<p eid="para_161">Are copies of this correspondence available?</p>]
[<p eid="para_163">Yes, I do.</p>]
[<p eid="para_165">I thank Mr. Gloster. If I understand him correctly he is saying that as an organisation Tusla advocated through the budgetary process with the Department for an increase in allowances.</p>]
[<p eid="para_167">If there were some evidence of this it would assist me, and perhaps the committee, in advocating for those foster carers. If this is the case and we have the proof of it, we can ask where the Department was in its engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We can ask why we have been left with a situation whereby foster carers feel extremely patronised by the fact the allowance was a paltry sum by any objective analysis. The great job they do is acknowledged in the language that is used but concrete supports are not forthcoming in real terms. I acknowledge there is a strategic plan but I am not sure whether, following what happened with the budget, foster carers now have confidence in that. There is a political element to this. There needs to be engagement with Government parties on the non-delivery of supports. If it is the case that Tusla has actively advocated then, I say "fair play" to it. This must be acknowledged and there is a line of questioning that must be pursued with the Minister.</p>, <p eid="para_168"> What is happening with Positive Care Ireland? Has it been wound down? Is it still in existence? What is its status?</p>]

[<p eid="para_174">I thank Mr. Gloster.</p>]
[<p eid="para_176">I thank the Chair for her guidance on this and I respect the fact it was previously addressed by the committee. I just wanted the most up-to-date information as per October of this year.</p>]
