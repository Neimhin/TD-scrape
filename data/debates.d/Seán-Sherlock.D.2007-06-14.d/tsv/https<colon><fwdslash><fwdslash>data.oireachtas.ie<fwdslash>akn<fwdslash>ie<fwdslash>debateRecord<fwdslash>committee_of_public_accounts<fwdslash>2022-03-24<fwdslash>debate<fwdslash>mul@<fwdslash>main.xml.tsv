[<p eid="para_221">I wish to talk specifically about the retrofitting of houses. A very good report was issued by Age Action Ireland in respect of the need for a new energy poverty strategy. The existing poverty strategy is out of date, as I think we all know. I hope to get a sense from the SEAI of where it sits in respect of ensuring scarce resources are deployed in a manner that ensures those people who are on very low incomes and who live in fuel-impoverished houses can be targeted in a way that makes sure the resources flow down to those who are most in need. The new national retrofitting plan, which is part of the climate action plan for 2021, has a target of bringing 500,000 homes to a B2 building energy rating by 2030. Our guests can question my figures, but we know that something like 18,400 retrofits were completed in 2020, approximately 4,000 of which raised the homes concerned to a B2 standard. We must, of course, take the pandemic and the associated challenges around meeting targets into account.</p>, <p eid="para_222">That was challenging in terms of meeting targets. I want to get a sense from SEAI, from a corporate point of view, whether it sees its role as one that ensures it is not just people with means who take the lion’s share of the grants available for retrofitting because right now that is the case, and we can argue justifiably that that is the case. I want to make sure we have a system in place that ensures people who are fuel impoverished and who are on lower incomes get a greater chunk of that grant aid.</p>]
[<p eid="para_225">I appreciate that. We are all talking the language of the just transition but nobody has been able to identify what that means in real terms. Dr. Byrne talked about "energy poor", but that does not necessarily mean income poor. A distinction has to be made here. I could be living in a well-appointed, high-value house in south Dublin, for instance - I do not mean to unfairly target south Dublin or characterise it in a particular way - and it could be worth up to €1 million, but it could be energy poor. Yet, the income coming into the house might a multiple figure of what might be coming into a typical 1970s bungalow in rural north Cork, for instance. In the income levels there could be a massive disparity. I am seeking an understanding from SEAI on whether or not Government policy is being directed to ensure that SEAI targets fuel-impoverished or energy-impoverished homes, but also households where the income levels are much lower. That is the key.</p>]
[<p eid="para_227">Forgive me if I am misinterpreting Dr. Byrne but I think he saying that his role is not in respect of social policy and income thresholds, but purely on E, F, G rated homes and targeting them. However, you could be living in an E, F or G BER-rated house and be a multimillionaire with plenty of cash in the bank. I am trying to get a sense as to whether the SEAI has received direction from the Government from the point of view of having a social policy instrument that targets people who depend on the State for their income, who are on meagre pensions or who are on low incomes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_229">Forgive me if I am repeating questions that may have been asked but what is the skill set required? What is the scaling up of the skill set of the labour force in order to meet a target in excess of 500,000 homes to be retrofitted? Where does the SEAI fit into the conversation that is happening about meeting the labour needs that are required.</p>]
[<p eid="para_232">Based on Dr. Byrne’s reply to earlier questions, am I to understand SEAI's policy intervention in relation to granting of high-end EVs is leaving it to the market to decide on where the technology will land? Does that mean that when the technological solution becomes cheaper, that is where things will land in terms of a demand, supply and a price point? I ask this because, based on Dr. Byrne’s previous replies in respect of electric vehicles, that while it has built in thresholds in terms of grants, it seems it is ultimately waiting for the market to decide the cost of the vehicle. With respect, I am not sure if that is the right policy intervention. I would be glad to hear his views on that.</p>]
