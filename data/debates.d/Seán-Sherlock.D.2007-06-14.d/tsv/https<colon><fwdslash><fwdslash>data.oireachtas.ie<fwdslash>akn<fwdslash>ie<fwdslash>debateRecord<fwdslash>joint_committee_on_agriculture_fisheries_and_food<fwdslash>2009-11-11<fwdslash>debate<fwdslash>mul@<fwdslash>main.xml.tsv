SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the two organisations.  It is a difficult task to set out one's arguments before an Oireachtas committee, particularly in this case where views differ as to the future of the breed.  In regard to the legal position, Mr. Keely has stated that the previous directors declared the EGM invalid on the basis of allegations of forgery in the requisition of documents.  Ms Loughnane, however, stated:Following postponements and failed mediation efforts, the case was due to be heard in the High Court on 4 April 2008.  On that day, the former directors accepted in full the validity of the meeting and that the resolutions passed a year earlier on 31 March 2007 were binding from that date.As I am trying to reconcile the dates to my satisfaction, perhaps Ms Loughnane will outline the course of events and Mr. Cooke will describe the nature of the complaint.It is clear that both organisations are passionate about the breed.  The involvement of Horse Sport Ireland does not sit well with me.  If the Connemara Pony Breeders Society and the Irish Cob Society can control their own stud books, it is ludicrous that the Irish Draught Horse Society, if that is to be the legal entity, cannot have control of the breed's stud book.  What sort of political intervention is needed to restore that control?I ask for the delegates' views on the proposed breeding policy for the Irish draught horse and why such proposals are only now coming into the public domain.  The policy's objective is: "To breed Irish Draught Horses with good conformation, movement and temperament that conform to the breed standard, which will make good quality, sound, versatile horses and be a foundation breed that, when crossed with other breeds, will produce performance horses."  As I am a layman, perhaps somebody can explain what this means.  I suggest it represents a continuation of the existing policy, which could lead to further dilution of the breed.If one or other of the organisations before us controlled the stud book, would it be possible to ensure that the sport horse can flourish even while the draught horse is preserved in its purest form?  The two objectives are not mutually exclusive.  If we recognise the legality of the Irish Draught Horse Society on the basis of the various High Court actions that have been taken, we would also acknowledge that it should control it stud book and that its aims do not exclude Horse Sport Ireland.
