SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister states that the €1.3 billion reduction — he calls it an adjustment — envisaged will be offset by the 6.6% decrease by which prices have fallen.  The import of this is that a reduction of €1.3 billion in the public sector pay bill has no effect in real terms because prices have been reduced effectively by the same amount.  If one takes the 6.6% and the 7% levy, that is over 13%, and if one takes the potential for an increase in interest rates which is inevitable against a backdrop where there are no adequate supports for those people who will inevitably fall into arrears on their mortgages, then the Minister is creating a major problem for those people who are on middle to low incomes.  I ask the Minister to address the question of the inevitable rise in interest rates in real terms and the effect that will have for those people who will be affected as a result of such an increase.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I did not suggest an apocalypse.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I understand I have five minutes and that I am sharing time with——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to the praise meted out to the Fourth Estate.  My colleagues may have inadvertently forgotten to mention Jonathan Healy of Newstalk, Ralph Riegel of the Irish Independent, Barry Roche of The Irish Times, and all the staff in the Evening Echo.  
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Paschal Sheehy may have been on holidays but I understand he was here with us in spirit.I hail from the town of Mallow, which is in the flood plain.  Mallow has been flooding since Adam was a boy but the events of recent days have proven that the flood alleviation works have worked very well for the town.  The flood defences for the first phase worked extremely well.  It is important to acknowledge when work is carried out successfully.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I humbly give praise to the members of Mallow Town Council and its staff.  I refer to George O'Malley and the lads who put on the oilskins and go out year after year when flooding occurs.  There is no fuss.  They just get on with the job because that is what they do.  They do not want praise for it but that work is worthy of acknowledgement because they do it year in, year out.  This year they were out with the demountable walls, working with the area and town engineers, and had those defences up in no time.  That must be acknowledged also.I acknowledge the Minister's statement on the start of phase one in Fermoy but issues remain concerning the clean-up there.  At the risk of being parochial, both sides of the river, particularly at Rathealy Road, Francis Street, Thomas Street, Greenhill and Brian Boru Square on the north side, are all badly affected.  If some form of aid is to be made available, I ask that those residents be eligible for it, as should the people on the south side, particularly at Ashe Quay, the mart road, O'Neill Crowley Quay, Elbow Lane and Tallow Road, which were all badly hit.  It has been said to me that the Fermoy flood was the worst in the past 25 years.  That should be on the record because while we agree the works will commence shortly in Fermoy, some damage remains arising from the flood works in that area.  I ask the Department to examine the damage that has been done and look favourably on the residents and the businesses in that area.There is a stoicism among people who are born in the flood, so to speak.  They get on with life and do the business, but what seems to have characterised the flood events throughout the rest of the country is that they would not normally occur in those areas.  While we will deal with the problems in Fermoy and Mallow, and I visited south Galway at the weekend to see the damage done, it is vital that other parts of the country are examined in the same way as Mallow and Fermoy.It is important that the flood alleviation works due to be carried out in Fermoy do not compromise the amenity that is the rowing club.  There are proposals to carry out works on the weir on the Blackwater in Fermoy but we are concerned they will have a negative impact on the rowing club.  I am aware the Minister made some public statements about that in recent days and I hope he will look favourably on the fact that there is a rowing club in the area and that this amenity cannot be compromised in any way.It is particularly ironic that some members of the Fianna Fáil Party blame the flooding events on bad planning in certain parts of the country.  They might revisit some of their statements in that sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, stated that development on flood plains should be avoided, where possible, and that development should mitigate, not add to, existing risk.  Mallow Town Park is located on a flood plain.  It was owned by the Jephson family, which also owned Mallow Castle.  A descendant of that family sought to have the Mallow town development plan materially contravened in order that the land within the flood plain might be developed.  There has been a constant battle on Mallow Town Council in respect of this matter.  The people of Mallow want to ensure that the park will be held by them in perpetuity for the common good.  In light of the Minister of State's comments, will the Government entertain the possibility of compulsorily purchasing the land in question in order that it might be held for the people?
