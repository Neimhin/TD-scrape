SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the reporting by the  Irish Examiner today that Cork University Hospital is set to become the only acute hospital in Cork and Kerry, resulting in the downgrading of Mallow and Bantry general hospitals, the Mercy University Hospital, South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital in Cork city, and Kerry General Hospital, all of which currently provide acute care.  I seek such a debate in the House to ask the Minister for Health and Children to explain how she proposes that Cork University Hospital will become the sole provider of acute care.  I also seek an explanation as to how people’s lives in the catchment area of these hospitals will be affected as a result of this reconfiguration.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is it in order to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to discuss the reconfiguration of hospitals in the Cork and Kerry region?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	They are seeking to do away with acute services in——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister for his response.  The Minister is not giving us much solace on the responses to the downward trajectory in global milk prices.  Is there scope within the European Commission and will the Minister ask at next week's Agriculture and Fisheries Council for a dairy adjustment scheme to be implemented under EU legislation through the use of unused EU funding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Will the aid to private storage continue indefinitely or does it have a definitive timeline?  Quotas will be abolished in 2015.  Notwithstanding that we cannot foretell what will happen in global markets, the Government must take responsibility for the question that is on every farmer's lips.  Will farmers be able to produce milk after 2015, notwithstanding the current difficulties?  It would appear the Government has no coherent policy regarding the potential loss of many farms and an outflow from farming because we do not know what will happen in 2015.  There is no sense of direction from the Government in terms of planning for that eventuality.  Farmers need to get such a sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does the Minister acknowledge that approximately 243,000 on-farm deaths of animals occurred in 2007 in addition to approximately 30,000 still births?  Does he also acknowledge that the suspension of this scheme will result in an increase in on-farm burials without prior notification and potential environmental hazards?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, it indicates a significant year-on-year increase.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In regard to reducing the price differential between the Six Counties and the Republic, what is the nature of the consultation between the Minister and his Department and the knackeries and rendering plants?  The difference in prices are significant at present and even if the scheme is abolished it will remain high when one looks at the various monthly bandings.  Between new born and three months, the differential can be as high as €13.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Have bio-fuels fallen down the political agenda?  What is the policy directive coming from this Government currently in terms of prioritising bio-fuels?  If the rate of hectares is falling, can we deduce that there is a reduced political priority?  Will this arise as part of the review of the programme for Government, which is imminent?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What is the overall cost of this scheme?  If I understand correctly, and I seek clarification on this, the Féile Bia logo or emblem was replaced with the Just Ask campaign.  If I was being a little cynical I would say that it probably cost approximately €200,000 to come up with the wonderfully succinct and insightful words "Just Ask".  Has there been buy-in to the scheme from the Restaurants Association of Ireland?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With all due respect, on a point of order——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State with responsibility for food is here to answer questions once a month and I tabled this question last Wednesday so with all due respect——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister of State might respect the fact that I tabled the question in the first instance and I did so in good faith.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am entitled to ask a supplementary question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would it not have been more financially expedient to use the guaranteed Irish label, which is universally identifiable and would have cost significantly less?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I hope I have interpreted the Minister's response correctly.  Is the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food insisting at European level that all areas currently within the scheme will be retained?  Will new natural handicap criteria allow new areas to be included?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the publication of this Private Members' Bill and I congratulate Deputy Flanagan on the work he has done on it.  It is worthy of support.  Deputy Pat Rabbitte summed up the basis of the Bill last night when he stated that this is a growth industry for the times in which we live.  People find themselves indebted for whatever reason and in some cases they are extremely vulnerable, stressed and unable to discharge debts, not because of recklessness on their part but because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves.  Only a small number of debtors plunged themselves knowingly and recklessly into these circumstances.  In so far as recklessness is involved, it is not merely on the side of the consumer, but is frequently shared by the lender where moneys are recklessly lent in circumstances where questions might reasonably have been raised about ability to repay.  Honest, decent, law abiding citizens find themselves in these circumstances, and one has heard the case being made that they are being subjected to debt collection methods of which the House could not approve.It is important to speak about the culture surrounding instances where people find themselves subjected to inordinate amounts of debt.  It has been stated previously that the level of financial literacy in this country still leaves a lot to be desired.  If I look at the socio-economic group that finds itself largely at the mercy of debt collectors, I note they are invariably persons who may not have a degree of financial literacy that would pervade throughout all of the socio-economic strata.  In 1997, the OECD conducted an international audit literacy survey.  It found that 25% of Irish adults have difficulties with simple everyday numeracy and literacy tasks, such as adding up a bill, understanding a payslip or filling in a building society form.  The National Adult Literacy Association and MABS have done much work in this regard, but it is important that if this Bill is taken on board, we should look at the overall context of people getting themselves into increasing debt.  A proportion of those people will find themselves in that situation because they may not have read the fine print.It should be acknowledged that IFSRA has done much work in making the language of financial services much clearer for people, and the campaign for plain English has achieved much in that respect.  However, there are people who are still getting into debt, either through debt collection agencies or debt collectors, and a portion of that is due to an inability to understand the process on which they embarked in the first instance.  That must be borne in mind.When it comes to the issuance of a licence for the purposes of undertaking debt collection, it is important that something is built into the legislation that protects the consumer.  The licence holder should be made take cognisance of a certain set of criteria.  Although they are not dealt with specifically within the legislation, perhaps they could be dealt with in section 5 and section 6.  Where debt is being collected, it should be collected where there is an assignment of wages.  This is referred to in the Bill.  There must be safeguards to prevent an assignment of wages from adversely affecting the debtor's ability to maintain a basic standard of living for themselves and their family.  In particular, the level of an assignment should not undermine the debtor's access to the basics such as food, clothing, housing and basic utilities, so there is a social inclusion component built into the Bill in order for people to have their basic rights.There also needs to be more regulation of the costs of debt collection in order to protect the debtor and his or her family.  There are often penalty charges for late payment built into debt, and the interest payments on that alone are significant and sometimes can be a multiple of the original debt.  That is something that should be examined.In welcoming the Bill, we also need to look at whether or not there is a basic EU model.  Deputy Rabbitte stated last night that there does not appear to be a regulatory framework for debt collectors across the EU.  My research tells me that there is no such framework but I am open to correction on that.  We need to have some kind of overarching regulation of debt collection, so that every citizen knows his or her rights and entitlements.  There should be an effective right of redress in the Bill for the debtor in respect of harassment, excess debt recovery costs and the wrongful removal of goods.  If a regulator is empowered to look at this issue, there should be some framework to give a right of redress to the debtor.  If we look at the nature of most unregulated debt, it is very often at the hands of moneylenders.  It remains a difficulty as to how we can regulate moneylenders who operate in the black market, but for those who are incorporated and are collecting debt, then harassment issues should allow for a certain right of redress on the part of the debtor where actions are proven to be excessive.The defaulting consumer should have a statutory right to be advised on who is authorised to collect the debt so that there is complete transparency in the process.  It could be argued that the use of multiple debt collection agencies to collect debts simultaneously should be prohibited.  We dealt with the Fines Bill last week in the House.  We are witnessing a sea change in Government thinking, so that we are trying to keep people out of prison and facilitate them by allowing for payment of fines by instalment.  That is to be welcomed.  It could be argued that a similar type of facility should exist for people who find themselves in debt; they should not be subjected to the same offences.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We have had reports from Horwath, Wrixon, Teamwork and Professor John Higgins and today's Irish Examiner claims that all acute services other than those provided at Cork University Hospital, CUH, will be done away with.  Subsequently, a HSE press release stated that Kerry General Hospital will be excluded from the process.  What will be the position of acute services in hospitals other than Kerry General Hospital and CUH from 9 June?The people of the region have been through the mill, given the obfuscation on simple questions on the future locations of acute services for the countless thousands served by hospitals in, for example, Mallow, Bantry and Cork.  We want a little bit of decency and for people to tell us their intentions with regard to acute services.  Mallow General Hospital is efficient and at the top of its league in terms of cleanliness and the other HIQA statistics.  It needs its acute services, given its catchment area of more than 150,000 people.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We were told it was 9 June.  The Minister of State's reply states it is mid June.  I would like to seek a clarification on that.
