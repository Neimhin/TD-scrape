SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	How many companies does Meat Industry Ireland represent?  My second question, if it is not too pertinent, is how this new quality standard and grading system has affected the profit margins of the meat industry since it has been introduced.  Has there been a significant increase in profits accruing to the meat industry as a result of the implementation of this relatively new grading system?  I ask that question because I know one farmer in particular who is getting less of a return since the introduction of this system.  There are legitimate questions about this new system.I apologise for not being here for Deputy Eamon Scanlon's intervention.  I know he has a particular expertise in live cattle exports.  Therefore, if I repeat questions that have already been asked, I apologise.  A monopoly pertains in terms of  live cattle exports.  If one wants to export live cattle, one has to go through a one or two processors.  The trade seems to be controlled by a very small number of operators, one in particular who shall remain nameless.  How does that position affect the price that accrues to the primary producer?  Is it possible to unlock that monopolistic position to allow for the same level of efficiency in terms of the slaughtering process and for access to markets through the work of Bord Bia?  When there is a greater degree of competition in the slaughtering process it is important to ensure that the primary producer can shop around in terms of that market.  I would like to hear the views of Bord Bia and Meat Industry Ireland on those points.
