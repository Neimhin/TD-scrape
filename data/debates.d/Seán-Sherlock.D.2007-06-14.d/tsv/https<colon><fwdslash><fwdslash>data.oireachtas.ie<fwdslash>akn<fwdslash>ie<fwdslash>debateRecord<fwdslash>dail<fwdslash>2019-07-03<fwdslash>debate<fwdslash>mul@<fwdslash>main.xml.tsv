SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T18:00:00+01:00	When I raised this issue in November, I believe I was the first of the Cork Deputies to raise it. I brought it up again six days ago. I do not believe there is an economic justification for the closure of the Little Island mail centre in Cork. I would like to examine the justification for the decision in greater detail because we have not seen a detailed justification. To provide clarity for the proposers of the original motion, our amendment seeks clarity on the McKinsey report. The Minister has not come before the House to explain to us, chapter and verse, what is in the McKinsey report. We have now heard from Deputy Micheál Martin about the Accenture report. As the Minister stated, McKinsey and Company was commissioned to do a report in 2016 but we do not have sight of any information on the engagement between An Post and McKinsey, nor do we know what recommendations were made arising from that interaction.It is a fair assumption that the Cork centre was not the one that was slated for closure. I believe there was a politically expedient decision to close Cork on the basis that it was the path of least resistance. This process should be stalled pending a further interrogation by this House in respect of the decisions that have been made about Cork. I say this with some justification. If the previous Minister can come before the House and create a scenario whereby he seeks some sort of moral authority in respect of the increase in the cost of a stamp to €1, and if this House gives that Minister some impetus to do that on the basis that we want to give An Post a fighting chance, then I also believe that we have the right in this House, given there is a public interest at stake, to interrogate the decisions in respect of Cork. I have already rehashed the arguments in two previous interventions in this House in respect of the increase in revenue and the loss of retail business, so I will not go over them again. However, when revenue is increasing, the profit line is increasing and the company says it is moving into the parcels business, why would it then hive off one of the parcels centres as an area of activity and close it? That does not stack up and I do not understand it. Notwithstanding all of that, An Post's administrative costs, according to its annual reports, have ramped up as a percentage of sales and, specifically in 2018, went from €55.9 million to €63.9 million, which gives it an extra €8 million. To quote directly from a journal.ie post on 17 March, in its official rebranding An Post has spent €5 million, changed the colouring of its logo and created a fictional millennial character called Ciara, and there is a whole blurb about the future direction of An Post. Therefore, in these two examples, there is already €13 million that we have not had sight of or had an opportunity to interrogate. Yet, we in this House are expected to accept at face value the closure of a vital, modern and relatively new centre. I refuse to accept the justification for the closure of this centre until such time as we have a proper process by which we can interrogate those decisions on the basis that there is a public interest issue at stake. With respect to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, he said to me on the record of the Dáil on 20 November last year, when I first raised this issue, that “it must be borne in mind that this is a public company that has a commercial responsibility”. We have the right to interrogate that relationship between Government and An Post on the basis that we cannot accept an at face value everything An Post is telling us in regard to rationalisation of services at a time when its revenue is increasing. We want the opportunity to protect jobs and to give those workers a fighting chance. We need to know exactly how much has been paid to Accenture and to McKinsey thus far by An Post. While it is talking about savings and rationalisation, one could argue that the spend on consultants and on rebranding would have saved any number of jobs at the Cork mail centre.  I support the motion. We have put forward an amendment and I have clarified the rationale behind it. If it is the case that the decision is made absolutely and we are not given an opportunity in the House to interrogate that decision further, then our amendment seeks to ensure those workers get the best possible terms and conditions. We want to speak for those workers, if that is the case. Nobody has given up the fight, however. This is the third time I am on my feet in this House, trying to defend those workers on the basis of a set of rational arguments that I seek to put forward based on the criteria that have been presented to us, despite the lack of transparency in the process in regard to how An Post has dealt with this issue. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T19:30:00+01:00	I am seeking the guidance of the Chair from a technical point of view. I have two specific amendments on the rights of victims. These are amendments Nos. 48 and 29, which relate to the right of victims to information. Forgive me if I am way off track, but I am seeking to buttress the rights of victims in respect of notification. There is a specific request in my amendment that we would have regard to the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 in the context of information a victim would be entitled to. If I am off track with my intervention now, I beg the Acting Chairman's forgiveness. I do not have on the list of schedules sent to me an articulation of where my amendments sit in the restructuring of the Bill. I trust that makes sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:30:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 48:In page 17, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:“(b) any continuing effect whether long-term or otherwise of the offence on the victim of that offence and the likely impact on the victim of a grant of parole,”.”.This amendment and amendment No. 56 speak to the issue of protecting the rights of victims in this process.The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 gives victims a statutory right to certain information. For example, a victim may request information from An Garda Síochána, the Ombudsman Commission, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service, the director of a children detention school or a clinical director of a designated centre. The victim is entitled to information on, among other things, when a prisoner is expected to be released from prison, any temporary release of the prisoner or prison transfer. My expectation in proposing the amendments is that these criteria would be added to the Bill as ones the parole board would have to take into account.  I am not doing to die in a ditch on the amendments. I merely wanted to speak to the issue. It could be that what I am proposing in the amendments is already provided for in the Bill. If not, I would be grateful if they could be accepted.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:40:00+01:00	What I am trying to do is to have a reference to the impact on the victim inserted more firmly and unambiguously into the legislation. If my interpretation of the legislation thus far is correct, the impact of the granting of parole on a victim is not listed as a criterion that the board must take into account. The Minister says it is provided for in general terms, but there is no specific codicil or line in that respect. Therefore, I am seeking to tighten the legislation in that regard. I expect the Minister to respond by saying he is standing firm, which is fair enough, but it is my intention to press the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:40:00+01:00	Perhaps the originator of the Bill might have a view on this matter?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:40:00+01:00	I thank Deputy O'Callaghan. We have to legislate on the basis that there are all types of scenario. Victims come in many shapes and guises, but we have to legislate for reasonable grounds. Victims are referenced in the Parole Bill, but, as I understand it, they are only to be notified when a hearing is scheduled to be held, rather than when an application is made. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime ) Act 2017 gives victims a statutory right to certain information. That is the context in which I am proposing the amendments. I have made the argument which has been defeated, which I accept.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:50:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 56:In page 24, after line 14, to insert the following:
“Victims of crime: right to information
29. (1) Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 is amended by inserting the following as subsection (2A):“(2A) A victim of an offence may request from the Parole Board information regarding any application to the Board to be considered for parole by a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for that offence and the Board shall provide the information, or arrange for the information concerned to be provided, to the victim as soon as practicable.”.”.I am back to the same issue again. The amendment is self-explanatory. I ask the Minister for a response to this. It is a tightening up of the wording in respect of the rights of the victim. The key phrase here is "the Board shall provide the information, or arrange for the information concerned to be provided, to the victim as soon as practicable".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T20:50:00+01:00	This is a sensible amendment. I do not think there should be any cause to oppose this amendment. Is there?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-03T21:10:00+01:00	I congratulate the originator of the Bill, Deputy O'Callaghan. The Bill proves how we can all work together. We come here and make our arguments, and we win some and lose some, but we all support the broad thrust of the Bill. It is a fine Bill. It is a model of how Members of the House, if they all put their minds to it, can all work together on issues on a non-partisan basis. Well done to all.
