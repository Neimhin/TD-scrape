[<p eid="para_6">Apologies have been received from Deputies Dara Murphy and Heydon and Senator Ruane. I will now put my phone on airplane mode. The usual rules apply in respect of telecommunication.</p>]
[<p eid="para_7">The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00048/17 from Ms Anna McKenna who would like to see Drogheda, County Louth attain city status. Members have addressed some concerns about the issue at play and I want to give them a chance to intervene at this stage before we make a final determination on the petition. I invite Deputy Cassells to contribute.</p>]
[<p eid="para_18">We have before us a proposal to keep the petition live and open. We must have regard to the response that we received from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government through its assistant secretary general. Once one reads the document, one realises that it does not address the issue of city status, which is the subject of the petition that we are dealing with today. On that basis, there is a proposal here to acknowledge the fact that Deputy Cassells has addressed his concerns about the population of 6,500 that would come from the Meath side and the issues addressed by Deputy O'Dowd in respect of the CSO projections about reaching city status within five years or thereabouts.</p>]
[<p eid="para_20">Given the fact that the Department's response to this committee has not necessarily addressed, or adequately addressed I would contend, the issue of city status, there is a proposal here to keep the petition open, to correspond with the Department again and ask for further clarification in respect of the petition for city status, and to be very clear about that.</p>, <p eid="para_21"> There are other issues concerning the growth, development and planning issues. I respectfully suggest that they would be dealt with within the relevant line Department or line committees that deal with the environment and housing as that is the most appropriate way to do so.</p>]
[<p eid="para_23">I propose that we ask members for their support to keep the petition open, correspond with the Department again and ask specifically about city status. Is that agreed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_27">The good people of Drogheda seated behind Deputy Cassells cannot see his face at the moment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_29">I thank the members for their interventions on this petition. I acknowledge the presence of the good people of County Louth here as well. We, as a committee, are trying to broker some middle ground here where there is an acknowledgement of the reality that exists on the ground but without actually encroaching. I understand the concerns of Deputy Cassells in that regard. We are agreed that we will keep the petition open and will correspond further. I thank the members for their time discussing this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_30"> The next petition is No. P00004/19. I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_31"> In respect of Petition No. P0006/19, I propose that we forward to the petitioner a copy of the response received from the Department of Justice and Equality and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_32"> I thank members for their attendance.</p>]
