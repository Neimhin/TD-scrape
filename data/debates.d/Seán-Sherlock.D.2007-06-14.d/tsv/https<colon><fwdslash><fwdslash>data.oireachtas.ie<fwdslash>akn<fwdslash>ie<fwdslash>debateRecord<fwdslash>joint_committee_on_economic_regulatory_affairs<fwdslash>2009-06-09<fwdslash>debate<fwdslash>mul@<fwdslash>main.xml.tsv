[<p eid="para_27">I welcome the commissioners from the Commission for Communication Regulation.  The language that has grown up around communications is one I do not really understand.  I hear phrases such as "ensure seamless transition of the new responsibilities" but to speak in real terms, broadband provision is woefully inadequate in large tracts of rural areas. We must ask why is that still the case.  Mr. Doherty mentioned Japan, where if I am not mistaken there is almost full broadband penetration and at speed in excess of the Irish average.  Why is that still the situation in 2009?</p>, <p eid="para_28">Will there be another takeover of Eircom, because the "Australians" left it in a dire mess and with a severe lack of investment.  Will it be in a position to carry out its public service remit in the future?  Has the Commission had any contact with Eircom to discuss its future in recent months?  Would the people not be better served if Eircom was re-nationalised so that one could achieve the aspirations and aims that are set out in the presentation?  As long as Eircom remains as it is, the country will be at a severe disadvantage in growing the economy, achieving broadband penetration and maximising our potential in terms of new platforms.</p>, <p eid="para_29">It has been estimated and I think reported that RTE will require â‚¬70 million to roll out digital television.  If we believe the reports of the cutbacks, it would appear that RTE would not be in a position to do that.  Will RTE be in a position to meet its obligation to roll out digital television, and if not will it incur penalties?</p>, <p eid="para_30">My final point concerns postal services liberalisation.  The last time the delegates were before thie committee, we spoke about the Bolkestein directive.  What is its current position?  Will we see complete liberalisation of postal services?  Will An Post continue to be the sole provider of postal services or will there be a multiplicity of postal service providers?  What are the permutations for the public service obligation, PSO, given that there might be a multiplicity of providers in the postal services sector?  The concerns I have in this regard are based on whether one can guarantee that the service for people living in rural areas will continue into the future if there is a multiplicity of players in the market.  If there is further deregulation, will the PSO continue to be maintained and protected?</p>]
[<p eid="para_42">With all due respect, the country went to the market in regard to privatisation.  Mr. Doherty is telling us the penetration rate is 62%.  There are exchanges which have not been upgraded because of a lack of investment.  It is not an ideological argument at this stage but a pragmatic one that suggests if the infrastructure is brought back within its control, the State can invest the necessary resources to allow us to reach the rates of penetration we need to reach in order to compete in the manner we all want to compete, both economically and globally.  The bottom line as far as the people are concerned is that Eircom has failed in its purpose.  The unbundling of the local loop in accordance with European Union legislation has not been a success.  There is a school of thought that the market would not go near Eircom with a bargepole such is the state it is in.  I do not understand how Mr. Doherty can suggest it should be kept within the market structure.  Is anybody interested in Eircom?  Has anybody been in consultation with the commission in that regard?</p>]
[<p eid="para_45">Nobody would argue against that but is Mr. Doherty saying the national broadband scheme will deliver the rates of penetration necessary to turn the white areas of the map into red areas?</p>]
[<p eid="para_47">Does Mr. Doherty think that, in this day and age, one meg is adequate?  The benchmark is much too low here and the policy framework for broadband, on whatever platform, is not ambitious enough to enable us to compete with countries such as Japan.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">That is not the reality for people living in rural society.  Mr. Doherty is referring to conurbations or areas in which there are other platforms but the capacity is not available in certain areas of my constituency.  In the context of driving the rural economy certain areas, because of topography or geography, will not be served by those speeds.</p>, <p eid="para_51">The delegates mentioned WiMax and other platforms that will evolve over time and I welcome them but when will we sort out the Eircom mess?  Is it a political decision?  Does ComReg have a role to play or will it be left to the vagaries of the market?  If it is the latter we will have another conversation in 12 months' time on the capacity of Eircom to meet its public service obligations.</p>]
