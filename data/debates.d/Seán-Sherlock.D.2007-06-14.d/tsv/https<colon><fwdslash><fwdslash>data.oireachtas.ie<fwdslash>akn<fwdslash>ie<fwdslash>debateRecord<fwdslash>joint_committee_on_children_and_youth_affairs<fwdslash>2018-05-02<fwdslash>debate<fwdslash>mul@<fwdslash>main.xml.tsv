SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:20:00+01:00	I had to attend another committee to defend an amendment on an item of legislation, so I apologise if I repeat any earlier questions. I have read the submissions, which I found fascinating, and have listened to the witnesses. Will Dr. McCrory tell us about the cohort for Growing Up in Ireland?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:20:00+01:00	Is the programme funded entirely by the Health Research Board, HRB?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:20:00+01:00	Is Growing Up in Ireland funded in its entirety by HRB?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:20:00+01:00	It is a longitudinal study.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:20:00+01:00	Dr. McCrory said that 19% of children aged three are overweight and 6% are obese and that 50% of obese children will become obese adolescents. How do we disrupt the behaviour? What happens to the other 50% who do not become obese? Where do the two cohorts separate, one becoming obese and the other non-obese? This committee's goal is to support anything that disrupts behaviour. Both programmes before us, Food Dudes and Super Troopers, are about behavioural change. How do we create Government policies that give effect to disrupting behaviour in a positive way?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:30:00+01:00	I was going to come to that. My next question was going to be about the zero to three-year age category. Dr. McCrory spoke about breastfeeding and it being a disrupter of obesity in kids. Will he give me some sense of how we can disrupt behaviours at a much earlier age?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:30:00+01:00	Some 54% of parents of overweight children and 20% of parents of obese children in the Growing Up in Ireland cohort reported that they were about the right weight for their height. Will Dr. McCrory help us to understand how it is possible to get into those houses? He made a specific reference to lower socio-economic groups having a greater propensity towards obesity. If children have already been involved in an early childhood scheme, a crèche and primary and post-primary education, how do we talk to or educate the parents? Are we talking about public health nurses having a role or direct intervention in primary healthcare services? Are we talking about resourcing such interventions to a greater extent or carrying out studies to a greater extent? Where does the intervention take place to disrupt behaviours in the zero to three-year age cohort?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:30:00+01:00	The metrics Dr. McCrory has shown us create a picture that is - I am not saying it is dystopian - negative. If we are talking about a longitudinal societal scenario, for want of a better expression, the future does not look too bright. Is Dr. McCrory suggesting we have more public health nurses at the very early intervention stage and that their role be expanded? We all know what they do at the early childhood stage, but are we talking about greater public interventions and developing a cohort of public health nurses who would deal specifically with trying to disrupt that pattern? Does that make sense?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:30:00+01:00	Dr. McCrory is in Trinity College Dublin, as is Professor David Hevey. Has Dr. McCrory spoken to him about the Laya Healthcare research?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:30:00+01:00	I am a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and a great believer in breaking down silos. We can see the effects of the research when we look at the translational elements of the Laya Healthcare and Super Troopers programmes. The metrics for the satisfaction levels under the Super Troopers programme probably somewhere map the GUI longitudinal study. When we, as a society, start breaking down silos and get two eminent researchers such as Dr. McCrory and Professor Hevey to work across platforms such as psychology and health, perhaps we might start to see the programmes have a greater translational effect. I thank Dr. McCrory for his interaction. I have been reading the Super Troopers handbook which is mightily impressive. I have a little fellow at home who is almost ten months of age and look forward to engaging in the animal antics, doing the scissors jumps, the pasta dance, the magic numbers and taking part in the ball alley and potato races. It is about creating something that is about fun and subtle behavioural change. It is very positive. The statistics for take-up rates by schools speak for themselves. There were 330 primary schools in the pilot project; there are now 1,500 schools, with 238,000 children. If we, as policymakers, can do anything to help to have it fully translated into all schools, I ask Dr. McCrory to please contact us. It is a very worthy programme. Perhaps we might kick the tyres a little more on the research Professor Hevey has conducted and then bring it back to the Government and especially the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health. I would love to see bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland putting more funding into this space to see if we can really disrupt the trajectory towards obesity. I do not need to tell Laya Healthcare how much it is costing by way of interventions every year. We all pay our subscriptions to the Layas and VHIs of this world.Our premia are increasing and this is obviously because we have community rating and we are funding more and more health interventions for probably preventable diseases. Therefore, anything we as policymakers can do that, in the long term, supports such initiatives as Super Troopers, we absolutely must do. The one question I have is where this needs to go. If the witnesses had one ask of Government as to the next steps, what would it be? They mentioned resources earlier. Are they satisfied they have the resources to take this a step further? What would be their wish list if they had the Minister for Health or the Taoiseach here, for instance? Mr. O'Connor can answer the questions after Ms O'Reilly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	What is the ballpark cost?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	Has Mr. O'Connor done some figures as to how much it would cost to take the programme to the full rate of penetration of all schools?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	A €3 million headline overall budget.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	To be fair, that is not a massive-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	Perhaps I can make a practical suggestion that we as a committee write to either the Minister for Health about it or the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for health promotion. Perhaps we could also write to the Taoiseach directly to see if there is any way we could either meet with him or facilitate some meetings between the stakeholders here and the Taoiseach, with a view to seeing how we can translate a programme such as this right across the schools and whether there is anything we can do to assist the programme.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	For health promotion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	And the Taoiseach.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00	On that point, Ms O'Reilly referred to the active flag and the fact that Super Troopers is a stakeholder in that regard. We have all visited schools as Deputies and Senators where there has been the raising of a green flag, and one need only see how that behavioural change is having an effect translating into the home. I have not seen the evidence of this yet in respect of the active flags. That is not to say it does not exist; I just have not seen any research. If we are talking about positive public health policy, obviously there would have to be some more tyre-kicking regarding the research the witnesses have conducted. However, I do not see any reason that could not be done. If we are serious about tackling obesity, it will require the deployment of resources, and if there are programmes that one can just take on or partner with, that is the model we must use because there is an evidence base here of it having an effect. This is why I would love Dr. McCrory to talk to Professor Hevey. Perhaps that can be facilitated because that is the space we need to be in. The different sides are quite complementary, I would argue, and they are both within the same organisation. If there is a way of talking to one another to see how we can work on this one and come up with practical solutions, we should try to do so.
