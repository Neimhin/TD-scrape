[<p eid="para_20">I will be brief.  I welcome Mr. Guiomard and his colleagues.  With regard to the cost of €2.33 per passenger on top of the Government passenger taxi, what is Mr. Guiomard's opinion on whether we are screwing passengers to the wall with regard to infrastructure, at a time when we are trying to get more people to use Irish airports on either short term or long term visits?  Is there scope for a reduction in that figure even further?  In the current climate by reducing that figure is it the case that financing is being tacked out for a longer period to encourage more throughput through the airports?</p>, <p eid="para_21">My second question relates to the travellers' protection fund.  Is there a projected figure for 2011?  The size of the fund has decreased from €7.5 million to €5.5 million.  I take it there has been a number of failures - 19 failures according to the commission's submission.  Is the commission projecting further failures within that sector and what contingencies are in place to account for that possibility?</p>, <p eid="para_22">I refer to the potential merger of the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the National Transport Authority.  What kind of synergy is envisaged by the commission in terms of its role in that equation?  I presume if there is synergy there will be doubling up of resources and personnel.  What are the projections as to possible efficiencies in light of such a merger?  Will Mr. Guiomard give details of the nature and outcome of the 300 passenger complaints?</p>]
[<p eid="para_24">To have some clarity on this point, I wish to ask another question.  I understand this is the Commission for Aviation Regulation.  I ask Mr. Guiomard to correct me if I am wrong but in layman's terms I imagine that the ability to maximise throughput is part of the commission's remit.  Is there scope for the regulator to seek to influence Government with regard to the annual throughput of passengers through the airport and how the charging mechanism affects that rate?  I take Mr. Guiomard's point about the charging mechanism and I make the distinction between a Government policy and what is within the remit of the commission.  However, I would like to see regulators expressing opinions as to what needs to be done to get more punters through Irish airports.  If Mr. Guiomard could step outside the comfort zone and give the committee an opinion, I do not think anybody will come down on him like a ton of bricks.  I make that comment with due regard to respecting his position.</p>]
