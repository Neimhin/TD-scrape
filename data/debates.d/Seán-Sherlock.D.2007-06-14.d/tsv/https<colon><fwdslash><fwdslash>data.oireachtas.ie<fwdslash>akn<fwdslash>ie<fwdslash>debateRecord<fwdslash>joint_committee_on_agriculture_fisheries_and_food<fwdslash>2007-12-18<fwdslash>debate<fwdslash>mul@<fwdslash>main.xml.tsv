SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the submission made by Ms Webb.  It is based on a rational approach to this problem.  The issue of GM foods and the importation of grain and feedstuffs should be based on a rational, scientific approach.  The Irish position has fallen victim to the French position within the EU Council on this issue.  At the meeting taking place today or tomorrow, it appears that the French position at the Council of Ministers will be vital to this.  I wonder to what extent the Irish position has hitched its wagon to the French caravan.  If the scientific evidence clearly put forward by the standing committee is one which allows for GA21 to be imported, I do not see why it should not be brought forward.  I do not see why Ireland should not take a common-sense approach.The question is whether this committee has any competence in influencing the Minister's position.  If that is not the case then perhaps we are talking here in a vacuum.  The Minister needs to take a very clear approach, one way or the other.  I would advocate that the Minister propose that this would be imported, but also that the timeframe under which the standing committee operates be shortened.  It is not affecting the competitiveness of Irish agriculture, but it is affecting EU terms of trade on a global basis.  The Japanese can do it within a 12-month timeframe and the FDA in the US can also do it much quicker than here.  We need to catch up with the science on this, but the politics also needs to be addressed.  The nub of the matter is whether the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will take a strong position, endorse the position the IGFA is advocating and, ultimately, whether she will move to benefit Irish agriculture.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In respect of the rationale, and one always likes to take a rational view of these things, we have been genetically modifying crops and grains since Adam was a boy.  The discovery by monks of how to brew beer was a process of genetic modification.  Much of the scaremongering needs to be tackled.  That normally feeds into the political process and I believe it is feeding into the current political process as we see it within the Council of Ministers.Given the climactic chaos that is occurring globally, the EU must take a firm line on this.  Climactic incidents throughout the world and global food shortages mean science must deliver seeds and grain to ensure food security.  I call on the Government to think ahead about the permutations for Irish agriculture's position at EU level.  To be frank, the Government has been sitting on the fence.  I call on Fianna Fáil members to press the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which I will do in my capacity as an Opposition spokesperson, to adopt a rational approach to the issue.  The future of Irish agriculture depends on it.
