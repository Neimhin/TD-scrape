SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2019-11-06T13:30:00+00:00	Good afternoon. We are now in public session. On Petition No. 00021/19, the decision of the committee is to forward a copy of the response from the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. 00033/19, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2019-11-06T13:40:00+00:00	I agree with Deputy Cassells. The two issues that are before us are absolutely worthy of discussion. One's instinct is of course to seek to keep the matters on which they are based alive, but for the purposes of the Standing Orders of the committee and so on, we are constrained to a certain extent in terms of seeking to further the issues. There are plenty of other line committees through which the broader issues that Deputy Cassells referred to can be addressed, such as the committee which addressed it last night.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2019-11-06T13:40:00+00:00	I thank Deputy Cassells. We have agreed to forward a copy of Petition No. 00033/19 and close it. On Petition No. 00038/19, I am seeking the committee's agreement that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. On Petition No. 00039/19, it is proposed that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank you for your attendance at the meeting today and I propose that we adjourn until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 20 November. Is that agreed? Agreed.
