[<p eid="para_41">I am happy, if the Chairman so wishes, to allow Mr. Doherty to field these wide ranging questions at this stage.  I would come in later if that is all right?</p>]
[<p eid="para_72">I will be brief.  I thank the commissioners for their presentation.  I am probably typical of most people in not being a technophile, although neither am I a technophobe.  I have a BlackBerry and access to all the communications I need, which I am fortunate that my position in this House allows but which is not typical of everybody.  There is a glaring disparity between those who will eventually be able to avail of the next generation networks and others, many of whom I represent in a mixed urban and rural constituency, who must still dial up to gain access to broadband.  If ComReg's <i>modus operandi</i> is one which seeks to protect the consumer, it is incumbent on me to ask why there are people in rural areas who do not have access to broadband.  How soon can they expect access to it?  Given the glaring disparities between those who can avail of next generation networks and those who are still dialling up, questions have to be asked of somebody.  Is this a result of Government policy?  If I ask the Minister a question on the rates of penetration in respect of broadband roll-out, I am told it is a matter for the individual companies involved and a commercial consideration.  If that is the case, does ComReg have any competence in that regard?  Can it put its boot up a companyâ€™s proverbial backside to force it to roll out broadband?</p>, <p eid="para_73">My other question relates to the situation involving a typical person living in a rural area of County Cork when an application for the erection of a mast is suddenly made to the county council, whose policy of co-location means that three masts can be erected in one area.  That is of great concern to people in the community who are powerless to do anything about the matter.  Can ComReg assess the level of radiation in the area to allay their fears?  Does it have the power to ensure the policy of co-location espoused by the county development plan of a local authority can be overridden?  What redress does an individual have if he or she has legitimate concerns about that policy?</p>, <p eid="para_74">My next question relates to the postal sector.  We are all familiar with the Bolkestein directive on the liberalisation of postal services and the stormy passage it enjoyed.  Liberalisation of postal services has been on the cards for a considerable time.  Concerns have been expressed to me on the question of whether it can be guaranteed that there will be a universal service obligation.  If somebody lives in a remote rural area, does he or she have the same rights to a postal service as somebody living in a town such as Mallow, Fermoy or Mitchelstown?  Will ComReg have a substantive role in ensuring this?</p>, <p eid="para_75">I understand there is provision for a certain amount of radio spectrum or bandwidth to be given over to religious or community organisations.  I refer to WPAs but as I do not even know what they are, the commissioners must forgive me.  I am not, as I said, the most technically minded.  What has been the take-up of that facility?  What is the percentage of broadband penetration in the country as a whole?</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">Effectively, the group broadband schemes were done away with.  The SWRA which operated the scheme in my constituency was making great progress in this regard.  However, it is to be replaced by the national broadband scheme.  As I understand it, the criteria governing eligibility for the provision of broadband have changed.  Where it is deemed there is a service provider in a particular area, no other person may apply to provide a service.  While parts of north Cork are serviced by a service provider, more rural parts of the county do not fall within its remit.  Arguably, people will be left behind, despite the introduction of the new scheme.  I wonder if ComReg has a role in this regard and hope my point is clear.</p>]
