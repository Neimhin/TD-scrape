[<p eid="para_34">I welcome the additional allocation for Bord Bia.  On a technical level, does the Minister have complete discretion on allocating funding in this manner?  Could the funding have been allocated elsewhere if she so decided?</p>, <p eid="para_35">Is there a danger that the funding allocated could be used to market pigmeat that is not of Irish origin?</p>, <p eid="para_36">To elaborate on Deputy Creed's contribution, it is all well and good to have quality-assured bacon, but if the labelling regime is not backed up adequately by legislation to ensure it is known what meat is of Irish origin, there is a danger that non-Irish produce will be marketed.  Is there scope to define clearly what is of Irish origin?</p>, <p eid="para_37">There is no doubt about the merit of the work done by Bord Bia when one considers the amount of food Ireland exports annually.  However, the pigmeat industry would probably like greater supports or increased funding from the Department to ensure the labelling regime is strengthened legislatively to guarantee that brands cannot be passed off as Irish if they do not contain Irish produce.  If this were achieved, consumers would be fully aware of what they were buying.</p>, <p eid="para_38">The beef industry is growing but must cope with the cost of feed and the increase in grain prices worldwide.  Is it within the Minister's remit to reduce the cost of feedstuffs in addition to implementing measures to ensure the competitiveness of the Irish beef industry?  The cost is having an impact on the market.</p>]
[<p eid="para_89">I thank the Minister for a fairly comprehensive response.  With regard to the Food and Veterinary Office report, one Dane, one Briton, one Italian and one Irish do not make a ban.  Is this a realistic proposition?  Will the ban take place?  No matter how much lobbying one does, a Minister negotiating at the Council of Ministers will always have a view, whether on or off the record, as to whether or not the ban will be enforced.  The Minister's reply seems to indicate that there is no appetite for a ban.  Irish beef farmers want to hear if the ban will be imposed.  Since the enlargement of the European Union, our influence on issues such as this has waned, as have traditional alliances.  I would like to hear the Minister give a more definitive answer.  Does she think a ban will be put in place?</p>]
