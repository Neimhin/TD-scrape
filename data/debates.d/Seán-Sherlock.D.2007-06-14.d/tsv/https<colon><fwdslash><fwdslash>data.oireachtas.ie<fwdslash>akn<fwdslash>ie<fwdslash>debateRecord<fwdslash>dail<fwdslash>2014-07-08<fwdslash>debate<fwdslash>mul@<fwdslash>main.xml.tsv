SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-07-08T14:00:00+01:00	The report on the value for money review of small primary schools will be published as soon as my Government colleagues and I have finalised our consideration of it and its recommendations. I am not at this time in a position to give a precise publication date. The report contains much detailed technical data concerning small schools in the primary sector and also a suite of recommendations and options. The Government needs time to properly consider the report and its recommendations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:05:00+01:00	It is important in giving effect to proper public policy and proper educational policy that due consideration and time is given to all the inputs involved in the making of such a report. One must examine issues such as the diversity of provision in an area, the ethos of schools, parental choice, the language of instruction, distances pupils must travel and the provision and costs of school transport, the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type and the costs of running small primary schools. It is not something one would rush into given the important nature of educational provision. The Government seeks to ensure proper and due diligence is done on public policy and educational policy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:05:00+01:00	It is the Government's intention to publish the report and due consideration is being given to its contents.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:20:00+01:00	Provisional net overall expenditure to the end of June 2014 by the Department is more or less on target. Expenditure of almost €3.88 billion is running just €24 million, or 0.6%, behind profile, with €7 million on current expenditure and €17 million on capital. The Department continues to closely monitor the financial position with a view to ensuring that expenditure remains within the allocation for the year. This Government has sought to protect education spending and maintain front-line education services as far as possible. However, levels of educational expenditure cannot be determined in a manner that ignores the economic reality. Consequently, there is no scope to reverse the decision taken in budget 2012 to reduce the level of capitation payable. Within the Department's overall multi-annual capital allocation, over €28 million was issued to primary schools last November for the school year 2013-14 under the minor works grant scheme, while more than €70 million in total has been allocated to the 2014 summer works scheme to allow more than 770 schools nationwide to undertake improvement works. Funding for future minor works and summer works schemes is subject to funding.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:20:00+01:00	I agree with some of the sentiment of the Deputy. In a perfect world, we would have the perfect pot of money to allow us to do everything we could within the education sphere to ensure the amount of voluntary contributions made by parents through charitable donations and fundraising was lessened considerably. There is a macroeconomic picture, however, and we must reduce the deficit to 3% by a certain year. Fianna Fáil subscribes to that philosophy and that means the education silo has a finite pot of money. To govern is to choose, and we must make choices about where to allocate funding. With regard to the comment about electioneering, Deputy McConalogue's party is a dab hand at making announcements prior to elections. Let us take the cynicism out of it and say that we have tried to ensure we put money into schools through the minor works scheme and the summer works scheme where it is necessary. Some schools missed out because of the prioritisation process, but they are not being cut out of the pot. Hopefully, these schools will go in the pot for next year, and it is the intention, if we are €500 million ahead of profile in terms of overall taxation receipts, that it will reflect positively on the education budget. This will allow us to fund projects such as those outlined in the question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:25:00+01:00	In March 2011, the macroeconomic picture in this country was abysmal and we were a programme country. However, we have been able to maintain the capital budget and we have a five-year programme where we are replacing prefabs and building new schools. Therefore, in spite of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, we have been able to build out and replace the prefabs that have been in existence since the height of the boom. Therefore, there is no doubting the Government's commitment to trying to ensure funding is put in place for necessary work. We have not yet started the proper discussions around budget 2015. Therefore, it would be premature to give an absolute commitment at this stage. However, if we had committed funding for this year, 2014, and if the economic profile is getting better, one would be hopeful. That is all one can say. If the Deputy was standing where I am standing, this is what he would be saying. We would hope to be in a position to try to ensure that schools funding for the necessary repairs and minor works will be provided, but we cannot say that for certain until we have got through the negotiations on budget 2015.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:25:00+01:00	The position is that Ireland received funding for a European globalisation adjustment fund, EGF, programme to support redundant workers from SR Technics. This consisted of a personalised package of guidance, training, educational and enterprise supports which were delivered to the eligible workers concerned during an implementation period from March 2009 to October 2011. Measures included tuition costs of the ALBA degree in All Hallows which, normally being a part-time programme, was delivered on a tailored full-time basis to accommodate the specific requirements of these workers given the finite timeframe for EGF co-funded support. When this funding ceased, the Department provided a grant as a once-off measure to this cohort of students to complete their studies. The Department allocates funding to the HEA for direct disbursement to approved higher education institutes and the internal disbursement is a matter for the governing bodies. The provision of courses is a matter for individual institutions as autonomous bodies.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:30:00+01:00	It is important to state that All Hallows is a private college and is not in receipt of core grant funding. However, the Department provides grants in lieu of tuition fee funding to the college in respect of three approved undergraduate courses. This funding amounted to over €430,000 for the 2013-2014 academic year in respect of the 119 eligible students who attended courses for the full year. The ALBA programme referred to by the Deputy is a part-time course and is, therefore, not an approved course for free fees funding. A decision was made to provide specific funding - initially under the EGF and subsequently by means of the grant scheme - to certain students, namely, former employees of SR Technics who undertook the course on a full-time basis. When the EGF funding was withdrawn, the Department agreed to support the full-time qualifying students to complete their studies. These were ex-SR Technics employees who were undertaking the ALBA degree on a full-time basis. As already stated, the institutions are autonomous bodies in their own right. I hope this answers the Deputy's question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:30:00+01:00	I am not unsympathetic to the case the Deputy is making, particularly in view of the impact the course has had on those individuals who, as he states, were out of formal education for such a long period. I contend that it is not necessarily for the Department to intervene. In circumstances in which a course of this nature could be provided by another institution, I would make the argument that it would be a matter for that institution to subsume it into its own programme of courses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:30:00+01:00	An exception was made. It must be remembered that it was a part-time course and that funding would not normally be provided in such circumstances. The Deputy referred to a particular institution, but there are any number of institutions throughout the State which could, subject to their internal criteria, subsume the course on a full-time basis. I do not know how the Department could intervene in that matter. In fact, I do not believe there is a mechanism to allow it to do so. It was a result of the EGF and the specific circumstances relating to SR Technics that an intervention was made in this instance, and there is no doubting the positive impact of that intervention. If that were the case, one could set a precedent in respect of any number of other courses which could be brought through the Department to be delivered out into specific institutions.However, we must recognise the autonomy of individual institutions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:35:00+01:00	If I am not mistaken, the Deputy has raised this issue previously.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:35:00+01:00	I hope, therefore, that I am not repeating the same reply to the Deputy. To date, the Department has not received any formal submission from parents in north Kildare on the provision of a gaelcholáiste in the north-eastern Kildare region. There is a five year construction plan which is well established. The establishment of any new school is, therefore, considered in the context of the overall need for additional school places to meet future demographic demands. The Deputy has probably heard this before. I acknowledge that there is one post-primary school in Maynooth, Maynooth post-primary school. A new post-primary school, Maynooth community college, will be added to the provision this September. It will have an all-Irish aonad, which is the nub of the issue. I will sit down with the Deputy who may wish to address that point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:35:00+01:00	As I understand it, a total of 80 places are being made available through the aonad. If the Deputy is suggesting the demand from the community for a gaelcholáiste is such that the aonad is not a sufficient response, we will have to find a way of facilitating a further conversation based on an interrogation of the survey. The reply furnished to me suggests that included in the first year enrolment at the new school will be an allocation of 31 students for the all-Irish aonad. While there is no waiting list for the aonad, an additional 85 first year places can be filled in Maynooth community college. These places can be filled either in the aonad, on the English language side of the school or between the two facilities, depending on demand.Obviously, there is a gap between what the Department and the community are saying and, somehow, we are going to have to work to bridge it. I will speak with the Deputy after Question Time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:40:00+01:00	I am open to correction, but it is my understanding the Department has confirmed that, if is demonstrated that there is sufficient demand for education through the medium of Irish in the aonad over a four year cycle, the establishment of an independent gaelcoláiste can be considered.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:40:00+01:00	The Deputy and I will discuss the matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:55:00+01:00	I am aware of the concerns of all the patrons of smaller rural schools, including those of a Protestant ethos. How best to sustain provision for widely dispersed and small Protestant communities presents as a particular challenge, especially in any locality where the number enrolling in the school is declining to single figures and amalgamation is not an option because there is no other school nearby. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting minority churches in maintaining their schools is part of that policy. Nevertheless, resources have to be distributed to schools in a transparent and equitable manner. In this regard, pupil numbers are the fairest basis on which to allocate resources to a school, irrespective of its type. Eight small schools of a Protestant ethos were successful in their staffing appeals for September 2014.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:55:00+01:00	On the Deputy's question on dialogue, there is continuing dialogue on ensuring pluralism within the education system. Let me refer to a specific example. With the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, Dr. Paul Colton, and Mr. Owens of Cork Education and Training Board, we have in Mallow, where a small Church of Ireland school closed, fashioned a new model that will create a precedent for an education and training board to join a Church of Ireland school in creating a brand new school. What we are talking about is ensuring the recognition of the faith and the right of those with that faith to educate their community accordingly. We must try to ensure there is a model, or models, to allow this to continue. It is worth noting that there are 194 primary schools with a Protestant or Presbyterian ethos out of a total of 3,146. Based on the enrolment figures for September 2013, nine of those have one teacher, 73 have two teachers and 36 have three or more. Therefore, there is recognition of the community. There is no question about that. It is a matter of how we apply lateral thinking in coming up with solutions when numbers are decreasing in individual schools to such an extent that we need to consider new models.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-07-08T14:55:00+01:00	There is no doubt about that. There is satisfactory dialogue on ensuring the future of these schools and on recognising the challenges they face regarding pluralism in education. The answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".
