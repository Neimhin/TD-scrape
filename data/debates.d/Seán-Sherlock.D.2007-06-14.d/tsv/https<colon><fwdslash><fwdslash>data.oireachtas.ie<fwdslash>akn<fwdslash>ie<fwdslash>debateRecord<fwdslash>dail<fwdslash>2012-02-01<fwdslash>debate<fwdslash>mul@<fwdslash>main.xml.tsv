[<p eid="para_2076">Neither the   Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation nor his officials have had any discussions with such bodies as IMRO and PPI regarding reducing their fixed charges for commercial premises.  The Minister does not have any function in the setting of tariffs charged by such organisations. However, it is open to a person affected by such charges to refer any dispute in relation thereto for determination by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who has certain statutory functions in this area under the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.</p>]
[<p eid="para_2136">I wish to inform the Deputy that I have not put forward any proposals to enact a Stop Online Piracy style law.</p>, <p eid="para_2137">However, I would point out that an issue arose following a High Court judgement in October 2010 where it was held that Ireland was not in compliance with its EU obligations under Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC.  It was held that the Court could not grant an injunction against an intermediary in relation to  transient communications.  Until this judgment, it had been considered that Ireland was fully compliant with Art 8  (3) of the relevant directive and that injunctions were available both under Section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and by reason of the inherent power of the court in relation to equitable remedies. Following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it was considered that as the High Court decision was not appealed, it was necessary for Ireland, for the avoidance of doubt, to restate its previous understanding of its compliance with EU law.</p>, <p eid="para_2138">A public consultation was held by my Department last July in relation to the wording of a proposed Statutory Instrument amending Section 40 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  More than 50 submissions were received from interested parties.  I am most grateful to all who contributed to this consultation. It provided me with an excellent overview of all the issues and concerns involved.  I have also engaged extensively with interested parties in relation to any issues or concerns that they have raised in relation to the matter.</p>, <p eid="para_2139">The amended text of the proposed Statutory Instrument was recently published by my Department.  It should be noted that this matter was also the subject of a DÃ¡il debate on 31 January 2012.  I would expect that this legislative measure will be introduced shortly.</p>, <p eid="para_2140">I wish to state that the measures being proposed in the Stop Online Piracy Act in the United States are of an entirely different order to that being put forward in the Statutory Instrument.</p>]
