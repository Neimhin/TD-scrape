[<p eid="para_494">The Acting Chairman is very kind. I propose to make a short opening statement and then have a rapid-fire round with the Minister. I, too, welcome the competence of the Minister in respect of the vital role the Department plays in Irish society. I know there are Members present in the House who are part of a tentative Government who would be very sensitive to the needs of children and ensuring that we, as a society, recognise the role of children and the importance of maintaining a Minister at Cabinet level. That is vital.</p>, <p eid="para_495"> I thank the Minister sincerely for her work to date. I say without any plámás that she has been one of the most progressive Ministers that we have had in respect of her role. I genuinely wish her well for the future and thank her and her officials for the progressive role they have played in terms of protecting and progressing the rights of children in society. I thank her for being here today.</p>, <p eid="para_496"> I want to outline in brief terms that there is an element to this crisis that has not received the attention it deserves. For working mothers, the burden of childcare continues to fall predominantly on them during this time. As progressive as we like to believe we are as a society, the demands that have fallen on working mothers in the absence of a proper childcare structure means that women are effectively being held back because they are again assuming traditional household roles for the most part.</p>, <p eid="para_497"> That is the sad reality of the situation. As a parent of two young children, as progressive and all as I like to think I am, I know the reality is that working mothers still assume the vast bulk of the role of maintaining and managing a household. It is having an impact on their career progression as we speak. That is why it is vitally important that we restore the childcare system and have a pathway or roadmap which ensures all workers have access to the service in the shortest period of time possible. It is vital that we step up the energy levels that are required to achieve that.</p>, <p eid="para_498"> I wish to make a point regarding the wage subsidy scheme as it relates to women who are returning from maternity leave. The Minister may not be able to answer it as she is probably not the line Minister for the issue. It is vitally important that the legislation be amended, as articulated by SIPTU, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the National Women's Council of Ireland and Members in this House today, so that those returning from maternity leave are eligible to apply for the wage subsidy scheme. The Labour Party lends its voice to that call. If we are to talk about equality and the progression of women in society, we must ensure this anomaly is corrected by way of legislation.</p>, <p eid="para_499"> I thank the Minister for giving us some clarity today regarding the roadmap. My questions in regard to it are very simple. The first is specific and relates to the €15 per hour the Minister says will be paid to workers to go into the homes of healthcare staff. Has there been an assessment in real time of demand for that service? Do we know how many healthcare workers are actively looking for this provision? Second, what is the anticipated supply of workers? Third, where is the incentive for somebody who is currently availing of the wage subsidy scheme or Covid-19 payment as an employee to move off that payment and into work in the home of a healthcare worker? Fourth, what protocols will be designed around ensuring the safety of the worker going into the home? We recognise the needs of healthcare workers but we must also ensure that where a childcare or early years worker decides to volunteer, he or she can feel safe going into a particular house. Will there be Garda vetting of members of the household to protect the volunteer who is going in? Will that be a requirement of the scheme? What are the insurance permutations for the household into which a worker is coming? Those are my opening questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_501">I hope I will be able to come in with a second round of questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_510">My closing questions relate to who the eligible healthcare workers are and the point made by Deputy Anne Rabbitte, which is a vital one, regarding the phasing in of this measure in July. The Minister said, for example, it will be one day per week but that throws up major issues which I think we need answers to now in this House. There needs to be detailed answers to those types of questions because I can foresee families contacting me saying that they are being told they cannot avail of the service on Monday when they need it on Monday or on Tuesday when they need it on Tuesday. This is going to have a massive impact. It will put massive pressure on the providers in a way that will probably force them into a lottery system, which again will have negative impacts for families. These are the issues that need to be teased out in this forum, now I would argue.</p>]
