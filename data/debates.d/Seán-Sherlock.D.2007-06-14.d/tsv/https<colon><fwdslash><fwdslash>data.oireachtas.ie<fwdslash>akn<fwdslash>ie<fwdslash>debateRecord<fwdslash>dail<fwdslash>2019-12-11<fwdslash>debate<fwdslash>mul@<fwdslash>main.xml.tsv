[<p eid="para_382">Under chapter 5 of the programme for Government, which relates to emergency departments, there are clear commitments to enhance or build out the capacity of emergency departments to deal with patients in six hours or less. It is a clear commitment in the programme for Government.</p>, <p eid="para_383"> As we speak in Cork University Hospital there are 57 people on trollies. Will the Taoiseach seriously consider, as per the programme for Government, the use of hospitals like Mallow General Hospital and Bantry General Hospital to triage patients? Can we ensure that presentations are made through the medical assessments units, local injuries units and urgent care centres? These are also referenced in the programme for Government. Can we classify them as valid centres for people to present to ensure that we stave off the over-crowding that is currently taking place in CUH? We cannot have a situation whereby Dr. Padraig McGarry, president of the IMO, is rebutting the idea coming from management at CUH that GPs need to come in to carry out shifts in the accident and emergency in CUH at a time when primary care centres and GP surgeries are completely over-run.</p>]

[<p eid="para_745">On behalf of the Labour Party I support the Bill and welcome the initiative by Deputy Curran in respect of this matter. I share the sentiment expressed by the Minister of State about the existing offence. He said that the existing offence does not require physical custody of the drug and the prosecution can prove constructive possession, for example, when drugs are purchased online but not delivered into the hands of the accused. In the proposed offence, additional proofs may be required, which are not required to prove possession, and, therefore, this offence might unintentionally be more difficult to prove than the existing offence. I am sure Deputy Curran will clarify that at a further stage in the proceedings. It is a legitimate issue to be raised.</p>, <p eid="para_746"> Through popular culture and various television dramas, we are now seeing the articulation or expression of the exploitation of children, be it the passing of the burner phones or children acting as mules or lookouts. It is a reflection of the reality on the ground. We are faced with the vista of children being exploited in this way, with impunity, by these malevolent forces in our society. I share the views expressed by previous speakers about the need to ensure that children are not exploited and that there should be a penalty for the exploitation of a child. On that basis, we support the legislation.</p>]
