[<p eid="para_37">I welcome Dr. Heppner and Mr. Wolff and, on behalf of my party, thank them for the time they have taken to address us.  We are trying to understand the anatomy of the crisis as it developed and the response to it, to learn from this and ensure it does not happen again.  The restoration of public confidence in pork products before Christmas was largely due to the EFSA's statement on the absence of a risk to public health.  Without that statement there would probably still be a crisis.</p>, <p eid="para_38">I understand the distinction made between risk assessment and management.  Last week we had a detailed discussion on food hygiene legislation and food business operators and their obligations under the legislation.  Where does implementation of the HACCP legislation begin and end?  Is it solely a function of national parliaments or does the EFSA have a role?  Why was the type of fuel used here not governed by a legislative framework?  The HACCP principles determine risk and outline a reporting procedure.  Was there a failure of regulation?  Does the EFSA have competence in framing the legislation or advising the Commission or national governments on its interpretation?</p>, <p eid="para_39">Does the EFSA have a view on how we can learn from this event to enhance best practice among suppliers of food ingredients, how national legislatures can tighten their practices and how the Commission can ensure this does not happen again?</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">I should state for the public record that, while I welcome the fact that Dr. Heppner has come before the committee today, we could have received many of these answers by e-mail.  This is all part of a learning curve that the committee is on.  In terms of the questions that have been posed today, I suggest we should be speaking to representatives of DG Sanco, the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs.  For the record, I thank Dr. Heppner for attending but we may have wasted her time.  Perhaps she could still be sitting in an office in Brussels.</p>]
