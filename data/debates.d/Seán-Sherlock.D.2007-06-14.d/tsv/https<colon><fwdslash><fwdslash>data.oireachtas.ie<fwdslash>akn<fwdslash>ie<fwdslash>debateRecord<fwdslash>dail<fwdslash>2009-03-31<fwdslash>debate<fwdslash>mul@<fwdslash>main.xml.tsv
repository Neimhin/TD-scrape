[<p eid="para_248">I welcome the Minister's statement.  This is the second time in a short period that the Minister has clarified the situation in respect of Mallow General Hospital.  When will the Teamwork report be published?  The reconfiguration document was published on 15 January and laid before the regional health forum.  The document stated that the only services rotated through Mallow General Hospital would be outpatient and obstetrics and gynaecology services and no other services were envisaged.  ENT services are now being cut, which does not tally with the Minister's statement.  Will the Minister further clarify what day procedure services she envisages would rotate through Mallow General Hospital in future?</p>]
[<p eid="para_250">There are a number of centres of excellence in Mallow General Hospital also.</p>]
[<p eid="para_253">Does the Minister not acknowledge that a lack of investment in a day procedures unit, which has been mooted for the past ten years, is the reason those statistics are low?  If there had been such investment, Mallow General Hospital would be punching even further above its weight than it does at present.</p>]
