[<p eid="para_333">The "green economy" is a term used to categorise a range of economic activities which contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions, better resource usage, and respect for the environment.  It covers a range of activities from carbon trading to energy efficient and environmentally friendly products, renewable energies and eco-tourism.</p>, <p eid="para_334">The programme for Government makes commitments to supporting the sector, including through increasing support for energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes, establishing Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment, and expanding renewable energy generation to achieve our renewable energy targets.  Clearly, implementation of this agenda spans several Departments and State agencies.</p>, <p eid="para_335">As part of the jobs initiative, the Minister for Finance announced that an additional €30 million would be invested in the national retrofit home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes this year.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has indicated that this initiative will support an additional 2,000 jobs in 2011.  Other measures announced in the jobs initiative help to promote jobs in green tourism, such as halving the lower rate of employer's PRSI until the end of 2013 on jobs that pay up to €356 per week, removing the travel tax and cutting the lower rate of VAT.</p>, <p eid="para_336">The green economy is an area which could become strategically important for Ireland at a global level.  We have a number of particular strengths which can realise jobs and growth opportunities and contribute to export-led growth.  The sector already employs 18,775 people and the value of the Irish market in these sub-sectors was estimated at €3 billion in 2010.  However, the value of the sector globally is set to increase rapidly, driven by a range of factors, including EU directives and regulations, rising energy costs, increased investment in environmental services and infrastructure, consumer preferences, and climate change and international agreements.</p>, <p eid="para_337">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>, <p eid="para_338">The Department's agencies, namely, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, have established units dedicated to working with both indigenous and multinational companies in the so-called cleantech sector.  A practical example of the success of Enterprise Ireland's supports for the sector was seen in last week's announcement of the creation of 145 jobs in County Galway in the manufacturing of wind turbines.  Another notable development is that green financial services are part of the new strategy for the IFSC which was launched by the Taoiseach last week.</p>, <p eid="para_339">A number of policy issues need to be addressed to realise the potential of the sector.  Some relate to planning and licensing. Others relate to the capacity of the electricity grid and the price for delivery of renewable energy.  I will work with other colleagues to develop this policy framework.</p>]
[<p eid="para_343">I agree with the Deputy on the change of emphasis over recent years, but I disagree with him on the Green Party's agenda.  All parties in the House have been engaged with the agenda for a long time.  An additional 2,000 jobs were created in 2011.  A Cabinet sub-committee is dealing directly with this area and it gives Government impetus to it.</p>, <p eid="para_344">There is a challenge for Ireland in the next phase of commitments which we have to meet on carbon reduction.  That should give rise to new opportunities in this field.  It is not possible to quantify how many jobs will be created.  No one can do that and it would be unrealistic to do so.  However, I agree with the Deputy in another respect.  A SWOT analysis was carried out and it showed that there was a lack of coherence in overall policy due to a large number of State and local agencies being involved, and there was some fragmentation of the research base.  That is now being firmly taken in hand.</p>]
[<p eid="para_349">The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach launched the strategy for the international financial services industry 2011-16.  One of the initiatives is the creation of the Green IFSC whereby we pin down areas in which there are new opportunities ranging from carbon management, IP commercialisation, private equity investment to green tech fund management.  The Government is engaging in this space.  It is impossible, realistically, to set a finite target for job creation.  The main point is that we are setting down the policy framework by which we can drive these agendas and ensure strong political co-ordination and coherence.</p>, <p eid="para_350">On Deputy Boyd Barrett's proposal, I respectfully ask him to make contact with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and that he seek to meet him to ask him to consider it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_352">The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I have had separate meetings recently with the European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, with a view to building strong relationships to ensure Ireland maximises the benefits of our position in the European Union in terms of jobs and opportunities to further develop the economy.  Most recently, the Minister met the Commissioner on 24 June when they held an event in Dublin to highlight opportunities for Irish researchers, businesses and educational institutions under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, FP7.  The Commissioner highlighted the fact that upcoming calls for proposals under FP7 in July 2011 and July 2012 would be worth approximately €18 billion.</p>, <p eid="para_353">With a budget of over €50 billion in the period 2007 to 2013, FP7 is the European Union's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a national support network has been put in place, headed by the national director for FP7 based in Enterprise Ireland who leads a team of national contact points for various elements of the programme.  This support structure ensures a co-ordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all the Departments, agencies and other organisations involved.  Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and companies, large and small, to avail of the opportunities within the programme.  The range of financial supports available includes travel support which assists researchers to meet potential partners and proposal preparation support for academic co-ordinators and companies, covering all costs included with the submission of FP7 applications.  Ireland's target for the drawdown of funds from FP7 in the lifetime of the programme is €600 million.  Achievement of this target is well on track, with some €300 million already awarded to date.  I am determined that we will achieve the target set.</p>, <p eid="para_354">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>, <p eid="para_355">The next European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, to be called Horizon 2020, will operate from 2014 to 2020, for which the European Commission has proposed a budget of €80 billion in its recently published multi-annual financial framework for the period.  While no target has been set for the next framework programme which has yet to be proposed by the Commission and agreed by the Council, I am determined to ensure ambitious Government policies are in place in order that we can continue to improve our performance.</p>]
[<p eid="para_357">There is a multi-layered approach in this respect.  There is clear recognition of a strong policy started by successive Governments which forms the foundation for ensuring the maximisation of the potential for the drawdown of funds.  We are already involved in a research prioritisation exercise that will seek to concentrate on specific themes of research and, ultimately, commercialise that research.  However, it is important to have regard to the educational aspects of basic research and the commercialisation agenda.  The prioritisation exercise which involves all of the State agencies interacting with each other and the Department is about ensuring we maximise the potential to meet our targets.  In regard to Horizon 2020, the process seeks to ensure we will be more ambitious and that Ireland will become an agenda setter for the programme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_359">If I was to proffer a personal opinion, I would contend we could be doing more on the commercialisation agenda.  If we were spinning out more companies, for instance, from the higher education institutes, that would ultimately lead to further job creation.  It must be remembered also that our investment in research, or research, development and innovation, through the collaborative approach with all of the foreign direct investment companies housed here, ensures their continuation in the country.  It also ensures greater innovation in these companies.  It is a two-prong approach.  It is about trying to achieve more in the commercialisation space through the creation of more companies and also about ensuring the existing foreign direct investment, FDI, infrastructure is not compromised in any way.  It is also about ensuring the research component is maintained.</p>]
[<p eid="para_998">The High Court indicated that it intends to grant an order declaring sections 42, 43, and 45 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and section 45 of the 1990 Act to be unconstitutional.  In this new Bill, the response by Deputy O'Dea has been to import the exact provisions of four original sections that had featured in the now lapsed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009.  The 2009 Bill had been introduced by the last Government in the summer of 2009 but it did not proceed beyond its Second Stage reading in this House, which was completed on 11 February 2010.  Regrettably that Bill failed to make any progress on the last Government's legislative programme until it eventually lapsed with the end of the last Dáil.</p>, <p eid="para_999">The only really novel provision in this Bill is at section 7, which repeals section 45 of the 1946 Act which makes it an offence for an employer to pay to a worker remuneration less than the statutory minimum remuneration, or to fail to comply with statutory conditions of employment.  This section, which the High Court ruled was unconstitutional, was the subject of recommendation 19 in the independent review report, the Duffy Walsh report.  That report recommended that the mechanism for enforcing EROs be brought into line with that for regulated employment agreements and that, as an alternative to a criminal prosecution, a complaint could be brought before the Labour Court.  The report recommended that NERA be authorised to bring such a complaint in respect of either an REA or an ERO.</p>, <p eid="para_1000">I welcome the proposal to decriminalise the initial steps in the enforcement process of EROs.  It makes sense, as Kevin Duffy and Dr. Walsh had recommended, to allow room for NERA to bring a complaint to the Labour Court on behalf of an individual or group of workers rather than retain the current arrangements where enforcement is only by way of a prosecution before the District Court.  Unfortunately the incorporation of the proposed amendment on the enforcement of EROs at section 7 is the only provision in the Bill that responds directly to the specific recommendations in the independent review report.</p>, <p eid="para_1001">The new Bill does not contain any provisions to respond to other specific changes that were called for in the recommendations of the Duffy Walsh report.  Recommendation 16 of that report called for all of the changes that were proposed in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 to be enacted along with amendments to cover the additional recommendations made in the report regarding the legislative framework within which both the ERO and REA systems operate.  It makes no sense to tackle this task in a piecemeal way or to leave REAs to the mercy of some continuing legal challenges.  Unfortunately this Bill does not address the significant range of changes called for by Kevin Duffy and Dr. Frank Walsh to safeguard the statutory wage-setting machinery from the threat of constant litigation and judicial review.</p>, <p eid="para_1002">Recommendation 1 of the independent review report also called for an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 to provide a means whereby the scope of the particular establishment orders of JLCs could be reviewed by the Labour Court.  The report also recommended that the Labour Court be empowered to undertake periodic reviews of EROs in the interests of greater clarity as regards their purpose and the classification of the workers and the types of enterprises covered.  Action with regard to these recommendations will be crucial to providing protection for EROs against further legal challenges.</p>, <p eid="para_1003">Recommendation 9 of the independent review report also called for amendments to be made to the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 regarding the constitution and proceedings of JLCs.  This is another critical area in which action is now required in light of the High Court ruling.</p>, <p eid="para_1004">Unfortunately at a time when it is vital to provide more certainty for vulnerable workers in low-paid sectors the proposed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2011 presented by Deputy O'Dea offers only limited protection.  I am convinced that the urgent preparation of substantive legislation represents the only reliable means of guaranteeing protection for vulnerable workers in low-paid sectors.</p>]
