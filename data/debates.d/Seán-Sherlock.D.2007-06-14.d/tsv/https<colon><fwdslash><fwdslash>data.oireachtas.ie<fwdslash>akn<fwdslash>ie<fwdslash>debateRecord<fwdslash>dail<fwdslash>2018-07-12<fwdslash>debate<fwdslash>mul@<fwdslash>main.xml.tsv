It is an organisation that, since its foundation, has been committed to climate justice. I have witnessed the work that it does first hand in countries such as Ethiopia, where it partners with people on the ground to deliver the productive safety net programmes. It also helps to ensure sustainable food production. We have to make the link between what we are doing with this legislation and what happens in countries such as Ethiopia and others in sub-Saharan Africa. If we are serious about partnering with people in places such as Tigray in Ethiopia, we cannot be paternalistic about it by continuing to produce fossil fuels and emitting greenhouse gases, both of which are causing major consequences for the very people we are trying to help. We have closed the loop on that. We have shown real leadership and through Irish Aid we can send a very positive signal to the eight countries we are working with, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, that Ireland is now taking the lead in terms of a process of divestment of fossil fuels. This legislation also sends a very positive signal in terms of the Paris Agreement. We still have a long way to go to meet the targets that agreement set, as has been said, but today is a positive step forward. The Third Report and Recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which is subtitled, "How the State can make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change" should be mentioned. We will be grappling with that issue soon. Some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, composed of citizens of Ireland, are very radical and progressive. One of the recommendations, endorsed by 100% of the members of the assembly, is that the State should take a leadership role in addressing climate change through mitigation measures. The report lists a number of suggested measures. I look forward to this House engaging with that report. If we are radical and progressive in terms of our approach to this issue I believe we can become global leaders. I again congratulate Deputy Pringle and Trócaire. This legislation sends a very positive signal to our partners in sub-Saharan Africa.
