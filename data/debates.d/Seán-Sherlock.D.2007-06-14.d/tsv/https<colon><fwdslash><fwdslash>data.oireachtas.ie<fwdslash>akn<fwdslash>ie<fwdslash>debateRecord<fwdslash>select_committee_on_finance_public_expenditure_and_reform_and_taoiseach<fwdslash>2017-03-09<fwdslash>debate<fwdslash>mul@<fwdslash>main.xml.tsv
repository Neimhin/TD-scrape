SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:20:00+00:00	I thank the Minster and his officials for attending today's meeting. We are currently going through a process to establish various commissions of inquiry and tribunals. Taking the last two or three years, to date, how much have we spent on tribunals of inquiry, commissions of investigation and Oireachtas inquiries?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:20:00+00:00	I thank the Minister for his reply. The sum of €420 million is an extraordinary figure over such a relatively short period. I agree with the Minister that every party needs to have natural justice and the truth needs to be sought.However, I wonder whether such a cost should be borne, ultimately by the taxpayer, in seeking truth and justice, regardless of the subject matter. I think we all agree that these are important issues that should be the subject of tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation. However, does Deputy Donohoe, in his role as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, believe there is now a case to be made for these costs to be considered? I imagine the vast bulk of them are legal costs which accrue to legal practices. Has the Minister given any thought to the idea that we need to find some mechanism whereby truth and justice are sought and reported on in a way that does not put such a burden on the taxpayer? I take the point the Minister may make about the relatively recent referendum and so on but I do not believe that the Irish taxpayer wants to continue to bear these costs, particularly if they are, in the main, legal costs. There may now be some need for reform of this process because it is arguable that it is unsustainable.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:30:00+00:00	I take the point the Minister makes. Ultimately, it is the Minister's Department that will sign the cheque, or through which the cheque will come, regarding the fees structure and the entirety of the costs. Lest there be any ambiguity about my position on this, let me state that the right to have one's rights vindicated and be represented legally is absolutely sacrosanct, and I think we would all agree with that. However, is there a process by which costs can be capped while recognising the rights of all parties before a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry? Going back to the 2008 report, it seems that if the Comptroller and Auditor General is acknowledging the spiralling costs - at the risk of putting words into his mouth - then those costs are out of control. They are astronomical and ridiculous as regards the pursuit of justice or truth, depending on the content of the inquiry. The Irish taxpayer has the right to ensure that the most cost-effective mechanism is used, even if this means legislating for an upper cap on costs per hour or whatever formula is used to determine costs. I put it to the Minister that it is not possible for the Irish taxpayer to sustain over ten years a cost of €420.593 million. There needs to be a policy shift somewhere.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:30:00+00:00	I am not trying to be partisan in my approach here, and I do take the point-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:30:00+00:00	-----about the cost of tribunals. The mechanism is one thing. Whether it is a tribunal of inquiry or a commission of investigation, the appropriate mechanism is found. There is still the issue of the cost. I will close the matter off now because I take the point the Minister is making. Moving on, I think we all support the work of the Public Service Pay Commission. We support the Minister's endeavours in this regard because I think we want to ensure there is a formula that allows for a transition that is as seamless as possible after the Lansdowne Road agreement sunset. How does the Minister envisage the outworkings of the Public Service Pay Commission and how it will transition into the potential for a further negotiation downstream on public sector pay? I ask for his personal perspective on this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:40:00+00:00	The emergency framework is still in place but is the issue of those who are above the current threshold in respect of pension restoration working its way into discussions?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:40:00+00:00	Is the Minister satisfied that the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 is working?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:40:00+00:00	The move towards transparency has been welcomed by everybody and I hope vested interests will not seek to undo that or try to restrict the legislation in any way in the review. It is important that everybody has sight of who is registered as a lobbyist, for obvious reasons.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:40:00+00:00	Has the Minister had regard to the post-programme surveillance report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:40:00+00:00	Has the Minister a perspective on that in respect of the need to ensure ongoing capital investment for infrastructural purposes from a stability and growth perspective? The report is anaemic. It is a little like the teacher using the red pen to mark the copybook. That does not necessarily educate or offer solutions to the student as to where he or she has gone wrong or outline whether the teacher's own practices could be better. The report seems to be very much a desktop exercise. I do not criticise the originators of the report but the limiting factors of the Stability and Growth Pact in terms of our ability to invest more in capital expenditure for infrastructural purposes to boost the domestic economy is a bugbear of mine. How are the politics of that being played out at European Council level? We are facing uncertain times and there is turbulence ahead. It is not enough for the authors to describe the scenario here; there must be more about where the European Commission or the Council intervene to assist us to meet the Stability and Growth Pact and other targets in order that we can meet the challenges of the so-called "clouds on the horizon", to use their phrase. The pact is too restrictive. It does not allow the Government to operate within a wider envelope to boost the European economy further and to boost the domestic economy, in particular. What is the Minister's perspective on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	This is the point, is it not? Whether it is articulated through some flexibility in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact or European Council agreement on the point just made by the Minister, there must be some political formula that allows that to happen. It is arguable that we are overly constrained by the rules that exist at the moment. There must be, at an EU level, some mechanism to allow Ireland, from a macro-economic point of view, to invest without falling foul of the very strict rules that exist at present.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	The liability can be financed out over a relatively long period of time. If one is talking about roads or transport, for instance, there are ways of factoring that in. Financing over a long period of time allows one to meet the repayment costs in a relatively easy fashion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	We need to move away from the current situation where, for example, I would make a pitch for the Atlantic corridor and connectivity between Cork, Limerick and Galway and on up the western seaboard. Often it is a case of whoever shouts the loudest, from a political point of view, gets the spoils in terms of capital investment. We must find some other model. If I understand the Minister correctly, there is a suggestion that PPPs and engagement with the EIB on projects of the type to which I have just referred could be viable as options in terms of building out funding for transport-related capital infrastructure.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	Mallow and Charleville but there is a constituency boundary-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	There is an irony in the fact that I am talking about PPPs and the Minister is talking about State investment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T11:50:00+00:00	I thank the Minister for his responses. I will direct my last question, which is on the post-programme surveillance report, to the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. That reports makes reference to the potential for volatility in global financial markets to spill over into the Irish financial sector. Perhaps the Minister of State has not studied the report yet in detail but I would welcome his views on it. There is a suggestion that Brexit-related volatility could spill over into the Irish financial sector and could have a downstream effect on jobs. That seems like a strange thing to say, given that there is apparently a lot of interest in the Irish financial services sector at the moment from parties across the pond. Does the Minister of State have a view on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:00:00+00:00	Quality of life. These are all important factors.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:00:00+00:00	I am sorry to cut across the Minister of State, but Dublin will not be able to meet its housing needs any time soon, so Cork is well placed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:10:00+00:00	Will the Minister deconstruct the jargon for those who are outside of these walls?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:30:00+00:00	The Minister mentioned Mallow, Buttevant and Limerick.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:30:00+00:00	As his colleague has a fondness for Cork, we can join the dots.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-09T12:30:00+00:00	There is competition within Cork also.
