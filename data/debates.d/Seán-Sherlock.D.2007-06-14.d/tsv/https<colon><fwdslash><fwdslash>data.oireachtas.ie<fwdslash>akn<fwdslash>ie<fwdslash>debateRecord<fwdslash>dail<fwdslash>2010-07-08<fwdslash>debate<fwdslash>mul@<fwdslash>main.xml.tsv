SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Labour Party seeks, by way of amendment, to ensure the Act does not apply to any matter regulated by the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.  We believe strongly that if we are to support the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, it must be on the basis that there is a clear and unambiguous attempt by the stakeholders in the greyhound industry in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure the code of practice put in place to ensure the welfare of the greyhounds is maintained.I speak on behalf of the smaller breeders; these are the people I represent.  The situation at present is such that when one visits a stud dog with a bitch with the intention of breeding a litter, the fact is publicised in the sporting press immediately.  When pups are born one notifies the ICC, Irish Coursing Club, within 14 days.  Details of date of birth and size of litter are published in the sporting press.  The bitch can be inspected anytime during this period.  The control steward inspects the pups and takes a DNA sample.  At 12 weeks old, the control steward tattoos the full litter on both ears; the left ear with a personal identification number and the right ear with the litter number.  Before they are 12 months old, the pups are officially named and their markings entered into their identity cards.  These are the current procedures as they stand.I am in favour of field sports and coursing and I have been at greyhound meetings.  The people I represent are those who rear pups.  They do not consider that the establishments or kennels they have are dog breeding establishments.  They are genuine people who have a genuine regard for field sports and for the welfare of the animals they keep.  For the most part, they are not in it for the primary motivation of profit, in the sense of developing breeding establishments.  The gain for such people is a potential win at such a venue as Clonmel or Youghal and for the love of the sport.  There is no fiduciary gain for the most part.  Most of these people have been involved in the sport at an intergenerational level.  If a book were kept of their expenses, one could be guaranteed that they have made a loss during the years they have been involved in the sport.  The primary motivation is not profit but a love of the pursuit of the sport.  It is genuine and integral for these people.  It is an affront to insult these people with some of the language I have heard from various sides of the House and we must speak for them.  We wish to speak for them in a modest and reasonable way.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What is the current state of negotiations between the Minister's Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, if there are such negotiations, regarding pending legislation?  Is there a timeframe?  Are there heads of a Bill for amending legislation?  What is the status of the proposed amendment to the 1958 Act?  There has not been enough clarity on that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are being asked to pass legislation on the basis of a leap of faith.  In essence, a greyhound owner looking at the legislation who had not been in touch with the ICC or Bord na gCon in the past number of weeks would not be aware of what negotiations had taken place.  Therefore, there is still a lack of clarity as to the exact nature of the proposals.  If Members are being asked to pass this legislation, I would like to know more about the substantive nature of those negotiations, the qualitative and quantitative outcomes of those deliberations, and if we are to have regard and to have trust in the Minister or the Government of the day to deliver the right kind of amendments to the 1958 Act.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are trying to clear the way in respect of the body of animal welfare legislation.  I am sure the Minister agrees with our line of questioning in that we are merely seeking clarification.  We seek clarification on the negotiations with the ICC and Bord na gCon regarding the role of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food vis-à-vis the amended 1958 legislation.  The second point concerns how specifically that Act will be amended.The animal welfare Bill is under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  On no fewer than ten occasions, the Labour Party has asked the Taoiseach when that legislation will be published.  We do not have a Bill before us even though we are told it will be published in the autumn.  If this is on the C list of the Government's legislative programme, where is the balance of priorities and how does the Minister envisage its implementation?  Will legislation enacted now be superseded by that legislation or is it separate?  It is very confusing.  I am relatively new to this game but I am trying to speak with common sense.  With respect to the Minister, all I seek from him are some clear unambiguous answers to which Members are entitled.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister should be ministerial.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister should behave with the appropriate level of decorum and should not behave like a schoolboy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister should cut to the chase.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be brought in.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to refer to the Minister's Second Stage speech where he stated:I have also stated that I understand the legitimate concerns of certain industry sectors, such as the Irish Greyhound Board, and I am prepared to accommodate them as best I can.  For that reason it is proposed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would amend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to legislate for welfare provisions for members of the Irish Greyhound Board.We note the words "welfare provisions".  Given that the Minister has stated that it is not possible to give an indication today of what will be in the amended legislation, which we accept to a certain extent, in order to ensure that there is no ambiguity and so that the greyhound industry is not placed in a position where it is taking a giant leap of faith in terms of what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food might offer by way of the amended legislation, we propose an amendment that would make it clear and unambiguous as to where the Minister's intentions lie.  If he were to support the amendment that would give great solace to the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club and to every single dog owner throughout the country who courses hares or races greyhounds in such places as Curraheen Park and Youghal.
