SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:40:00+00:00	I hope the Chairman will forgive me if my question does not relate directly to the subhead. The additional increase of 4%, giving a total net increase of 8%, is welcome. My question relates to the sanctioning by Tusla of privately provided services for families such as occupational or speech and language therapy. My understanding is Tusla has put in place a new central procurement process for the provision of these services and that it is managed in Dublin. Will the Minister clarify whether the timeline in the provision of these services and being paid for them is short? I have heard of one case and I am trying to determine whether it is systematic where services have been provided for a family but Tusla is returning to court to seek a determination on whether the services should continue. Not only are there legal costs involved, there is also a delay in making payments for the supply of services such as occupational and speech and language therapy. There is the issue of whether the tendering and procurement process has become overly centralised, leading to people and families living in the regions - I refer to Cork in this instance - being affected by a new structure that has resulted in services not being provided for children. On the subhead, the issue concerns the cost of procurement and the provision of services, the delay in paying the service providers and the fact that Tusla is seeking a court direction on a case by case basis on the continuity of services such as occupational and speech and language therapy. Is the case to which I refer systematic? What are the consequences for service provision for individual children?I seek an insight from the Minister in respect of the legal costs that accrue to Tusla for family services and the family support programme, whether services are being provided in a timely fashion, whether payment to those providing the services is processed efficiently, whether the added legal layer is eating into the Department's overall budget and the necessity of seeking court direction in certain cases as that aspect is confusing to me. I seek an insight from the Minister and an understanding of the process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I must be very careful about the language I use. If I refer to seeking court direction, whether one interprets that as challenging------
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I am referring to a court determining the continuity of those services. A child may have access to certain services but Tusla may intervene and decide to seek a direction from a court in that regard. Such court hearings would involve solicitors' fees having to be paid by both sides. I am seeking to determine whether Tusla is going to court on a case-by-case basis to determine the continuity of services such as the occupational therapy and speech and language therapy interventions I mentioned. If it is, that poses a massive question. I am giving voice to a family of which I am aware. I seek clarity as to whether that is happening in the case of one family or on a systematic basis. I realise the Minister may not be able to provide the answer today but it is something that needs to be clarified.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	Why would-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I am raising a potential delaying tactic in the provision of a service for a child. I am trying to couch my language but perhaps I ought to be more direct.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I am trying to give the Minister every opportunity to clarify the situation. Allow me to be blunt. If a service is sanctioned for a child but the professional with the requisite skills to provide the service is not paid for that in a timely manner because he or she is a private provider, that is a serious issue for the service in general. If Tusla is now seeking court directions, I question the efficacy of its doing so in respect of interventions for individual families because that places a massive onus on the taxpayer in terms of the legal costs inherent in that process. It is particularly questionable if it has already been determined from professional advice that the child should benefit from very specific services. There is something wrong here and we need to lift the lid on it and get more transparency. The other issue I raised regards the reason for Tusla centralising all procurement services.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	Yes. Why is there no local agency to fulfil that need with the requisite professionals who are well able to provide the service?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I also raised the issue of cost. That is the reason for this meeting.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	Why would the Child and Family Agency seek to go to court to determine the continuity of a service?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	On the law of averages, if that is being done in the case of one child, it is happening systematically. I am asking whether it is happening systematically. I am trying to shed some light on that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	I appreciate that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	My question is simple: is Tusla centralising procurement services for the provision of occupational therapy and speech and language therapy? Must speech and language therapists now tender to provide services?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	The provision of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, is an in-house service------
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T16:50:00+00:00	To be clear, CAMHS is an in-house service with professional staff. From time to time or systematically - again, that must be clarified - it will procure services, but the procurement process seems to be centralised in Dublin. I seek enlightenment from the Minister as to what is the process. If it impacts on the delivery of services to the child, we need closer scrutiny of that and what exactly is the service. If the Minister does not have time to come back to me today on that, I am happy to engage with her or her officials at some future date.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	I thought I was clear about that. It comes back to cost. If one is talking about a cost reduction or a cost efficiency in the provision of services and if one is tendering for the provision of services in Cork through a process carried out in Dublin, I am modest enough to say that I do not understand the process. I am not afraid to ask a seemingly stupid question. It is unclear to me whether there is a centralised tendering process. If that is the case, does that have an impact on the provision of services? Does every single provider that is not a statutory provider like CAMHS, for instance, have to tender for the services it provides?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	I appreciate the Minister's response on bringing Tusla before the committee, but I am asking the Department and the Minister-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	The Minister will correct me if I am wrong. Am I wrong? Am I misinterpreting the system? The Minister will tell me if I am.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	The Minister needs to be clear with us on whether this happens or not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	The question is coming from a genuine place. I raise it because of issues with services that I encounter on the ground. That is why I am asking. I am couching my language. I know I am repeating myself. I do not understand the process, and if somebody could tell me definitively whether there is local autonomy on the provision of services like occupational therapy and speech and language therapy or whether people have to go through procurement-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-06T17:00:00+00:00	I have not had a sufficient answer to that question.
