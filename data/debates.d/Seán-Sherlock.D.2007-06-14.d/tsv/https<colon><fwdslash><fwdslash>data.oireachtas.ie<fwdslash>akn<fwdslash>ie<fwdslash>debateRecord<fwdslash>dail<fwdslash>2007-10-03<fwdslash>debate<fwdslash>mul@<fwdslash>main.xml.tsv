[<p eid="para_421">I raised this question in the context that Ireland has up to â‚¬8.1 billion in food exports on an annual basis.  Recently we saw that approximately 1.3 million tonnes of pigmeat are imported from outside the EU into Ireland and then branded and packaged here.  My question is based on the fact that Irish pig producers are rapidly going into decline because long-established brands are being marketed in such a way as to give the impression that they use Irish pig meat.  The European Union is currently reviewing the conditions and I understand the issue may be only within the competence of the Union.  However, the Government has a certain responsibility in the issue.  If there is no provision in our law to amend legislation, I call on the Government to ensure that labelling, through marketing and Bord Bia, is done in such a way as to ensure that where a consumer purchases a product perceived to be Irish, a clear label is attached to the product attesting to that fact.  This has serious implications for pig producers and I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the Government is making provisions in that regard.</p>]
[<p eid="para_423">Is the Minister aware that Galtee Foods in Mitchelstown, a company that has sustained people in the area for many years, recently closed?  One of the main reasons is the clear perception among consumers that, though its products were branded as Irish, they were imported and the Galtee brand has diminished in stature as a result.  It is a result of a certain degree of Government intransigence on the issue that we now see the demise of a traditional company and the Government needs to do more to ensure the industry, which has sustained many farming families for a long time, is supported.</p>]
[<p eid="para_462">I preface my question by stating the strong belief within my party that the loss of an industry that sustained many farm families and industrial workers throughout the land for generations was a travesty.</p>, <p eid="para_463">I put it to the Minister that the Indecon report, on which the Government based its recommendations, was incorrect.  The Government, therefore, cost taxpayers untold sums of money and put them through the process of going to the High Court which subsequently reversed the decision.  It was utterly needless and a waste of taxpayers' money.  Will the Minister respond on that issue?  The fundamental question is when the restructuring package will be introduced and the growers paid.  What level of consultation has there been with growers on the issue?  Has there been final and full agreement on the matter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_467">The Indecon report is important.  I want to find out exactly how much the Indecon report cost the taxpayer, how much it cost to go to the High Court.  The issue here concerns the public purse and how moneys are expended on behalf of taxpayers.  Can the Minister guarantee that Greencore will not challenge this decision which, although it has been taken at a political level, has yet to go through the board of Greencore?  It should be stated that the Minister is a shareholder or has a golden share in that company.</p>]
[<p eid="para_532">We have heard the quintessential civil servant's answer.  Every farmer takes responsibility for ragwort or any noxious weed.  Nevertheless, it exists extensively throughout the country.  One can have all the public awareness and information campaigns in the world, but action is needed.</p>, <p eid="para_533">Would the Minister consider funding local authorities to ensure this blight is wiped out, particularly on roadside verges?  Farmers and landowners take responsibility for noxious weeks when they occur on their land.</p>]
[<p eid="para_602">I take the view that the glass is half full but there is a trend in Irish agriculture of flight from the land.  This is largely due to global trends.</p>]
[<p eid="para_604">The WTO is influenced mainly by global corporations and that has an effect on small Irish family farms.  Will the Minister bear that in mind when she attends WTO talks or Council of Ministers' meetings?</p>]
