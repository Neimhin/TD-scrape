SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	I welcome both Mr. Deering and Ms Cassidy to the committee. Mr. Deering stated that the FSO is dealing with 400 complaints on tracker mortgages. Is that the cumulative number of complaints or are there more?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	I have a figure of 600 for tracker mortgages specifically. Is that correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	If I understand the figure correctly, the FSO has carried out a review of 600 complaints regarding tracker mortgages in 2015.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	It is quite a volume nonetheless. Mr. Deering states that two appeals relating to tracker mortgages were listed for hearing on 16 February 2015 and when they came for mention, they were withdrawn by the bank. Why were they withdrawn?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	Did the bank possibly settle with the complainants at that stage?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	On the FSO's interaction with the Central Bank, I will try to go back to what Mr. Deering said. The FSO stated that two of the complaints were remitted to it for further consideration, while the bank was unsuccessful in the remaining two appeals. Mr Deering stated that the FSO is waiting for the Central Bank to come back to it. He stated:We are currently dealing with approximately 400 complaints relating to tracker mortgages. In the vast majority of these, the mediation or investigation and adjudication of the complaint has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Central Bank examination statement here.What are the FSO's interactions with the Central Bank at present in respect of this process? How long will it take? Are those 400 cases de facto in limbo?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	Presumably, those complainants are communicated with and are fully au fait with the process in hand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	How many complaints has the FSO upheld?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	I am asking specifically about tracker mortgages.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	What percentage of the number of complaints pertain to trackers?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	What is the FSO's success rate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2017-03-02T11:00:00+00:00	We accept that. What has been the largest payment of compensation made to date?
