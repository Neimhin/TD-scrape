[<p eid="para_39">I support my colleague Deputy Upton.  The State can no longer justify a fund or subvention of €26.3 million, especially when we can, in this era of advanced technology, capture funding easily in an online setting.  We contend that if one can raise €90 million through online and off-line activity at a tax rate of 1.5%, one is creating a level playing pitch.  This is because one is not penalising bookmakers such as Mrs. Bambury in Mallow, an independent bookmaker who does not have an online presence.  She has been put at a disadvantage relative to Celtic Bookmakers, Paddy Power and all the major entities which can operate online and create companies abroad in Gibraltar and such places for taxation purposes.</p>, <p eid="para_40">Considering that the IMF has already been to these shores, one cannot argue that the Exchequer must now fund the industry with another €26.3 million.  I am a greyhound owner and hail from the town of Mallow which has a proud tradition of racing.  In anticipation of Deputy Edward O'Keeffe's contentions about Youghal, I had a dog running there a couple of weeks ago and, therefore, know the value of that location.</p>, <p eid="para_41">If there was sufficient political will, we could capture millions of euro in an online setting.  It has not been sufficient heretofore.  The Labour Party, including Deputy Upton, has much forbearance in this regard.  We have now created a policy that allows the Government to get off the hook and take on the larger players in the betting industry such that it can capture funding that will, in turn, fund the industry.  One could increase the number of jobs in the industry above the current number, 27,000.  To do this, however, one must think more laterally.  That is the logic of the Labour Party's argument and why I support Deputy Upton.  If we are sufficiently brave and bold, there is no reason we cannot tackle online betting.  The potential is massive and nobody will convince me that one cannot capture the online market.  I do not know whether tinkering around with legislation is sufficient.  Does one place an onus on the industry to capture the funding or place an onus on the Exchequer?  I would be happy to hear the Minister or his officials talk about how the system operates in other countries where what I propose has been achieved.</p>]
[<p eid="para_76">To what extent has the Minister explored the issue of online capture from a technical point of view?  While I acknowledge the reference to the French model, as far as I can see, we have no choice but to pursue online betting.  If we do not, the industry will falter in a situation where it will remain reliant on the Exchequer.  What technical advances have been made in this regard?  To whom in the industry is the Department talking in terms of such capture?  Is it only a legislative change that is necessary?  Will the onus be placed on the industry to capture its own fund or will the State be responsible?</p>, <p eid="para_77">It is easy to quantify the number of bets in an online setting.  Likewise, it is not difficult to ascertain how much is being bet on exchanges and so on.  Exchanges which are currently exempt from tax should also be part of the capture.  There is a somewhat nefarious system, whereby operators, by forming exchanges, exempt themselves from payment of the betting tax.  The bottom line is that the State needs this revenue capture and that the very future of the industry depends on going after online betting.  I am neither a technophile nor a technophobe, but I would like to know who in the State agencies is talking the language of online capture from a technical point of view.</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">Can the meeting resume after the vote?</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">Members must return after the vote in the Dáil.</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">We dissent from that position.  The Labour Party believes there has been more than enough time for the Government to seek to get an online capture and to expand that capture's remit.  It is not fair to other taxpayers that the Government would now seek to extract the €26.3 million.  We strongly believe that this amount could be obtained through other means.  On this basis, we oppose the procedure.</p>]
[<p eid="para_116">We oppose the motion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_121">On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish the Chairman, members, the Minister, his staff, his colleagues and the secretariat a happy Christmas.  I thank the Minister for his forbearance throughout the year.  I also thank his staff and colleagues for all of their hard work and great co-operation.  They were helpful at all times.  I wish the Minister well.</p>]
