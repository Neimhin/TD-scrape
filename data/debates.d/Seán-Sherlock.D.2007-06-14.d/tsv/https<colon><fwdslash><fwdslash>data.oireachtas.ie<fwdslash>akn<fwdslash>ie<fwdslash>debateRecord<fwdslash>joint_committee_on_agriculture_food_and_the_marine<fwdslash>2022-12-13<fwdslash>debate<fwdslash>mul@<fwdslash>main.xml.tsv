SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:00:00+00:00	I wish to continue on that theme. If I set aside the nature trust and the fact that corporates are piling in to the not-for-profit sector, it is good for ESG and for Coillte. That is where the game is at globally. It is all about ESG for corporates. That is fine. I can understand that. The new joint venture partnership, which I will call a special purpose vehicle, Coillte is considering setting up or is about to set up is a good way along the road. The process is not nascent or under consideration. It is very active. If I am reading Ms Hurley correctly, the legislation allows Coillte to do that or, at least, the legislation or the Act with regard to notification of what Coillte proposes to do may be silent. I do not know. I have not gone through the Forestry Act with a fine-tooth comb, yet, but I am sure the witnesses can anticipate we will. The answers we are getting suggest something is being is being created, about which exactly Coillte is not at liberty to tell us, but the dogs here on the street know exactly what is being created, with whom, and its purpose. We have been around the around the houses and I ask for clarity. Does such a vehicle impact on Coillte's pre-existing footprint? Is this fund or special purpose vehicle with regard to the additional footprint or does it affect the entirety of the Coillte estate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:00:00+00:00	That is fine. I will park it. Mr. Carlin has clarified it. The representatives have made mention of the new forestry plant and €1.3 billion of an opportunity. It is clear to me that this special purpose vehicle will now bid for some of that €1.3 billion opportunity. Is that correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:00:00+00:00	These are simple questions. They are not loaded. There is nothing too rhetorical about my approach. I am looking for light more than heat. I have looked at the grant rates for establishment under this new forestry plan. I assume Coillte will have looked at all of this and kicked the tyres on the premiums for the farmer or landowner and will have looked at the establishment grants. Under FT6, it is proposed that the current grant is €5,620 per ha. The proposed grant per ha for broadleaf, mainly oak, is €6,744. I am only taking FT6. We know there is FT1 to FT12.Let us keep that figure in mind. For broadleaf, mainly oak, the premium is €6,744. Mr. Carlin will be familiar with the Auxilia Group and its report. I think we all accept Professor Cathal O'Donoghue's bona fides. The professor is renowned and well established. I am sure Mr. Carlin has had access to this Auxilia Group report. I accept Professor O'Donoghue's bone fides anyway. I hope Coillte does as well. In Professor O'Donoghue's report, on page 37, there is a table entitled "Estimating total Establishment Costs by Species in 2023". Professor O'Donoghue states, for broadleaf hard, the total cost will be €10,551. Remember we have €6,744 of a grant, excluding the fencing, and this report is saying-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	Grant rates.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	Chair, I think I said I am excluding premiums. Let me very clear. I am talking about establishment grants.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	Chair, may I have some protection here?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	Establishment grants only. That is all we are talking about here. Okay?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	So as not to interrupt my flow again, Chair, with all due respect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	I thank the Chairman. The cost for broadleaf soft is €9,631. If I accept the bona fides of Professor O'Donoghue and if I accept the figures that the Minister has put to us in terms of the new forestry grant already, I see the people who will establish these new forestry grounds to meet all of our targets and all of our ambitions as set out, even including in Coillte's "A Greener Future for All". That is a great document. It captures the zeitgeist. It needs to be where we need to be. Coillte is showing real leadership for the first time in a generation in respect of acknowledging the role that Coillte can play in terms of mitigation through afforestation and sequestration, and also in terms of the public good. That is all good. However, I cannot see, when one kicks the tyres on those figures, how one will get in the person-power - let me not be gendered in my language - to be able to create the opportunities that Coillte is talking about or, and this is where I really need Mr. Carlin's perspective, the economies of scale that Coillte has to be able to compete in the market, or squeeze the market, so much that it will be able to say to private foresters or contractors that it will take them in. What will happen is that private forestry will be squeezed out because Coillte will have the economies of scale to be able to pay the premiums and possibly additionality there as well through the creation of this joint venture. I worry that when everything is wound up, it will be Coillte with the joint venture. The fund manager, as Mr. Carlin said, will already be the owner. Therefore, the fund manager, management company or whatever the entity is on the additionality will walk away with the premiums. Irish private forestry contractors will be forced to work for this entity because it will be the entity that will have the economies of scale to be able to outdo the smaller private forestry owners. Does that make sense? Does that concern chime with Mr. Carlin in any way?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	I will put it a different way. If I go back to that €6,744, if one has lands that are at scale with a partner that is funding into this new so-called "Coillte nua" entity, Mr. Carlin is telling me that the smaller forestry companies, foresters and contractors are more agile and leaner. I remain to be convinced of what Mr. Carlin is saying there, and I say that respectfully. If Coillte is competing in that space for that €6,744 and it has got the personnel and the access to equipment and machinery that it will begin to build up, I cannot see how Coillte could not but squeeze out the smaller operators unless they get subsumed by Coillte and begin to become price-takers on contracts that so-called "Coillte nua" begins to control. In other words, Coillte nua would control the entire forestry sector and there would be a squeezing out of the small private forestry companies. It is a genuine fear that I have.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:10:00+00:00	There is a difference. A private forest company will naturally go for private investment. It has no other choice. That is a given. Coillte is State-owned. That is the difference. I hope Mr. Carlin can appreciate here that what is a resource and what people feel they have ownership of is an entity that they want, not for their generation but for future generations who belong to us all. Can Mr. Carlin understand the fears of people when he talks about new constructs, joint ventures, special purpose vehicles or whatever? The legislation allows Coillte to do what it wants in terms of notifying or not notifying, as the case may be. I am sure there is a relationship with Coillte such that it is keeping the Department, its key shareholder, abreast of everything that is going on. However, my fear is that we will end up with large swathes of our own land owned by corporate entities, which are offshored, which are international and which are competing with Irish people. These are unnamed corporates and international investment funds.All of that is being cloaked in the language of ESG, of environmental goods and of climate action. That is the fear we have. We have sold off a lot of resources in this country that we could do with now. I will take as an example Irish Sugar in my hometown of Mallow, which was sold down the river for a song. The fear I have is that this is what Coillte is at as well.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:20:00+00:00	I would like to have Ms Hurley's perspective.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-12-13T21:20:00+00:00	I ask for a few more seconds. Ms Hurley mentioned Irish investors. Is this a multiplicity of special purpose vehicles? There is the one entity that has already been named, which is a UK investor. Is Ms Hurley saying there are other investors that will join with it or Irish investors who are going to take a piece of the pie as well?
