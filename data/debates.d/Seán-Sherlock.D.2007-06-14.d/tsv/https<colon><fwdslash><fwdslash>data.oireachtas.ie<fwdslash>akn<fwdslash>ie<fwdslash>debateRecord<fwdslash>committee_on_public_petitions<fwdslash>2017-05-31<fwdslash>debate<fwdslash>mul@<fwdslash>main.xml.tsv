SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-05-31T13:40:00+01:00	We are now in public session. The next item is to record the decisions of the joint committee. The first petition for consideration is No. P000024/16, submitted by Mr. Thomas Mackey, regarding the criteria to qualify for a primary medical certificate. It is proposed, first, to correspond with the Ombudsman and seek his views on the scheme as it currently stands and to request an input on the actions that could be taken to address the needs of the petitioner and, second, to correspond with relevant advocacy groups seeking observations regarding the current eligibility criteria relating to primary medical certificates. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P000036/16, which was submitted by Mr. Neil Tolan and which proposes the establishment of a regulator for the gambling industry.It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise that the petition will remain open. The secretariat will correspond with the Department periodically to seek an update on the progression of legislation. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00001/17 regarding the responsible service of alcohol. It is proposed to correspond once again with the petitioner informing him that, if a response is not received within two weeks of the date of the correspondence, the petition will be closed. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00008/17 from Mr. Martin McGowan. It is proposed to correspond once again with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government outlining that while the committee welcomes the progression of the Mediation Bill 2017, that Bill does not address the issue of the absence of legislation to tackle overhanging trees. The committee further requests that the Department examine current legislation and regulations in the UK with a view to considering a similar system for Ireland. The committee also requests that the Department report back to it. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and advise of further steps being taken by the committee. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P00015/17 on widening the eligibility requirements for Irish citizenship by descent. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition is No. P00017/17 from Mr. Mark Llewellyn, entitled "Introduce refundable deposits on bottles and cans in Ireland". It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and to close the petition. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-05-31T13:50:00+01:00	Yes.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-05-31T13:50:00+01:00	The Deputy will be aware that the Department published a report, entitled "Review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative Model in Ireland" in July 2014. As part of that review, the introduction of a refundable deposit scheme for bottles and cans was considered. However, the report concluded that the scheme would be inappropriate because there was a scheme in operation by Repak. I agree with the Deputy in that there may be recourse for further examination of what Repak is and does. Perhaps a more appropriate course would be through the line committee responsible for oversight of these matters, if I might make that suggestion.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-05-31T13:50:00+01:00	Is the proposal agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration is No. P00019/17 from Mr. Jonny Anderson, entitled, "The Lough Foyle Ferry Service should be maintained by the Irish and British Governments". It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department to the local authorities pertinent to the Lough Foyle area and seek an update on the matter. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-05-31T13:50:00+01:00	By forwarding a copy of the petition to the relevant local authorities, we can assess their response to us and see how to proceed from there. Keeping it open is the wisest thing to do. Is the proposal agreed? Agreed. As there is no further business, the meeting stands adjourned. I thank members.
