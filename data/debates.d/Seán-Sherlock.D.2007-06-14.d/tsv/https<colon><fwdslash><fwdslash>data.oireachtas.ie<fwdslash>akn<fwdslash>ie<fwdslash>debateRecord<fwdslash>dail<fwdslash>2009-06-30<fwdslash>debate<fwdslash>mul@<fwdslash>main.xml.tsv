SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does the Minister of State accept that while some farmers made profits that could be described as super-normal in recent years, when historically high prices were being paid for milk, the vast majority of them reinvested those moneys in their farm holdings?  Does he agree that the lowest price being garnered in the market at the moment — 20 cent per litre — is completely unsustainable for dairy farmers with small and medium-sized holdings?  I take the point the Minister of State made about export refunds.  I welcome the extension of the aid to private storage scheme.   Is the case in aid scheme in operation at present?  What kind of take-up is it enjoying?  Is the efficacy of the calf replacer scheme being analysed at present?  As part of the overall process of increasing market supports through the EU, will the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food examine the relationship between producers, retailers and the co-operative movement?  It seems to me that the relationship is unbalanced — it is not based on equity.  Perhaps the Minister and his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, should consider introducing legislation on fair trade practices.  We need to ensure the multiples act fairly when they designate a price to the primary producer, especially as the primary producer is a price taker.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I respectfully suggest that this is not necessarily a short-term blip.  This is potentially a structural change in the market.  Nobody, up to the EU Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner herself, can foresee what will happen in the market in the future.  Will the Government consider other means of ensuring that primary producers of all hues are guaranteed some kind of fair market price for their produce in the retail multiple sector?  I refer to the introduction of fair trade legislation, for example, or the appointment of a retail regulator.  Such measures should be introduced as part of a package that includes the market mechanisms being implemented by the Commission.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Without meaning to sound facetious, the Minister of State could have dealt with this point when answering Question No. 28.  However, this is a question of marketing negotiating power.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am at pains to understand some of the arcane practices of this House at times.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I take your point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Commissioner has outlined a number of points which are aspirational and laudable in their own way.  For Irish agribusiness to flourish there needs to be a fundamental shift in the position vis-à-vis the retailer and the primary producer and processor.  This has been already outlined in great detail.  Rather than waiting for report after report, will the Government not grab the bull by the horns, take the initiative and implement legislation?  It should stop waiting for the European Union’s guidance on every matter relating to the agribusiness sector in this economy.  We have a very viable market, with the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, at the forefront given that he has responsibility for food.  We need to see action now and that relationship needs to be reinstated.  This House has the power to implement its own rules and regulations vis-à-vis the relationship, as it does not contravene EU rules.  I ask the Minister of State to act urgently to reinstate that relationship.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The model to which the Minister of State aspires is the French model whereby one goes to the Carrefour for one's larger cheaper products and to the boulangerie for one's baguette and so on.  The problem with the Irish model is that there is absolutely no transparency vis-á-vis profits.  A lack of transparency vis-á-vis the profits of the larger multiples affects the relationship between the product, primary supplier and the retailer, thus allowing situations as that described by the Minister of State.  Until we get that transparency we will not get a better deal for the primary producer resulting in a loss of jobs in this economy.  We are already seeing this in the Border counties.  Members are aware of what happened with Tesco.  
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I beg the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, but an ombudsman will not be enough to rectify the problem.  This will require a legislative framework such as fair trade legislation.  That is the only way we will be able to guarantee jobs and smaller producers some degree of livelihood.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Some of the farming organisations in Macra na Feirme have expressed disappointment that a number of farmers who acquired quota after 1 April have been excluded from the scheme.  Will the Minister of State set out the reason or logic for excluding these farmers who were new entrants having only acquired quota after 1 April and will he state whether it is possible the Minister will reconsider his decision?
