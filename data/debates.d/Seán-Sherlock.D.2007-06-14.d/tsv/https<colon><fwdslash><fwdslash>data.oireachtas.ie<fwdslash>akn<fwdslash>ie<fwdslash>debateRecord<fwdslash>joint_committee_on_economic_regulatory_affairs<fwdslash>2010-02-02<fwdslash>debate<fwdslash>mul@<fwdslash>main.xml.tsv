SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the delegates to the joint committee.  On page 7, the submission states: "Our concerns in this regard have already been heightened by the recent news that the Registrar of Credit Unions, when recruited, will report to the newly appointed assistant director general for financial supervision in general, rather than the Director General or CEO, as is currently the case."  On page 9 it states: "In light of this, the ILCU board is proposing that a new independent credit union regulator be established under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment."  Even if the regulatory regime was such that the ILCU reported directly to a director general under the auspices of the Central Bank, what is the difference between that and a new regulatory regime under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?We all recognise the role of credit unions and the amazing work they do.  As Deputy Ardagh said, they have provided a backbone for many communities because their ethos is very different from that of banks and other financial institutions.  We want to find a compromise that will ensure the future growth of the credit union movement and put in place a regulatory regime that ensures there is confidence.  If the new regulatory regime was under the Central Bank would it not be a safer house, given that the regulatory regime should change for the better once the de Larosière and European Commission proposals are introduced?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With regard to the availability of credit, the credit union movement has a particular view on section 35 of the Act.  I understand section 35 provides that not more than 20% of credit unions' loan books may be out on loan for longer than five years.  In these constrained times when vast numbers of people seek to reschedule their loans, does this have a negative impact on credit unions' ability to deliver a surplus, operate properly or allow a greater degree of flexibility for ordinary members throughout the country who might want to reschedule?  Has the Minister given any consideration to amending section 35 to allow for that so that the people who take out the car loans and who cannot make payments can extend the life of the loan?  Currently they are hampered from doing so because section 35 has not been amended.  What is the view of the delegates on that?  I understand a submission has been made in this regard, but we are unaware of the position on that currently.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Has the Minister given a specific date for that order?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With respect for the submission made, I have yet to be convinced.  We all recognise that a different ethos exists within the credit union movement from that which created the fiasco that was the banking crisis, with some notable exceptions within the credit union movement.  However, as a percentage of overall credit union activity, the less than kosher practices used in some credit unions seem minuscule.  By and large we all agree credit unions are well marshalled because of the individual ethos of members and boards at local level who do a great job in ensuring the ethos is maintained.  However, if the movement is to convince me, as one humble member of this committee, that it should have an independent regulator, it would need to make a stronger case for inclusion under the current central bank commission than that it is separating from the banking regime.  The changes that will come down the line in that regard will be stringent.  If the credit union movement, where the regulatory regime is already quite strong, is within that framework, I do not see how this would be a problem for them.
