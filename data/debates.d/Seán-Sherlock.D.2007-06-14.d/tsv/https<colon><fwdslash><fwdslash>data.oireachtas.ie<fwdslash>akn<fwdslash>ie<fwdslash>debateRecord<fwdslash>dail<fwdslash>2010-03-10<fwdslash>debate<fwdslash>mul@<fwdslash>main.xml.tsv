SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	With all due respect, I indicated on this issue.  There is a motion before the House and all the Labour Party wants is to provide the Ombudsman with an opportunity to present the findings of her report before a designated committee, preferably the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  That is on the Order Paper and we are asking that there be some degree of common sense in terms of how this is approached.  We do not want further statements in the Dáil on this matter and, as Deputy Gilmore said, it can be done without debate if we facilitate the person in question.  That is all we are asking.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is a very reasonable request and it is all we are asking.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I note what the Taoiseach has said about the Ombudsman's Act being silent on the matter.  Again, we respectfully ask that the Taoiseach allow the Ombudsman an opportunity to present her findings.  I believe that is a reasonable approach.  This can be done in a non-partisan way.  I am sure this House could facilitate such a process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I support the amendment on the basis of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children report on primary care published last month.  There is a view that the primary care strategy will be vital in terms of health care provision in the future.  The Labour Party believes primary care centres should be licensed by the HSE and subject to the rules of HIQA.  If one adheres to the goals in the primary care strategy, one would encourage more people to be treated in primary care centres and moved away from accident and emergency centres.  If more people are to be treated in primary care centres, then it is obvious that we need more such centres and, therefore, one must provide some degree of stimulus to bring about more of them.I am aware of one such centre in north Cork which will bring together approximately 17 general practitioners.  The HSE has bought in as an active stakeholder in that process and the PCCC, primary, community and continuing care, programme will arise from the process.  There are beneficial social outcomes as a result of facilitating specific reliefs by regulation.I anticipate the Minister will speak to the issue of property-based reliefs and there is general agreement in respect of their future.  However, specific reliefs can be made in respect of capital investment or equipment.  We must be far-reaching in this regard.  I admire the wording put forward because it allows the Minister a degree of latitude.  We should consider the amendment laterally and take a lateral view of how we proceed with primary care centres, which the amendment facilitates.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It takes a regime change.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	May I tease out the figures that the Minister placed before us and seek a clarification on the number of contracts that are under negotiation presently?  I may have misheard the Minister.  I thought she stated 30 are under negotiation.  I want to get a more qualitative analysis of the present state of negotiations.  The reason I ask that is because I believe it is pertinent to the amendment.The current state of negotiations could be influenced by whether or not further stimulus is given to primary care centres that may be under negotiation presently or that persons may be thinking of setting up where they may have started cursory negotiations with the HSE or the Department of Health and Children.  Given the present state of the economy, the state of those negotiations will be predicated on whether there is a stimulus provided and an amendment such as this will definitely have an influence in bringing more of them to fruition.  That would be my party's view.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I listened with interest to the arguments put forward by Government Deputies, particularly from the Green Party Member from Carlow, because I never heard such patronising drivel in all my life.  To suggest that we are giving businesses a false hope by bringing forward this Bill reflects the unreality of Green Party Deputies.  This legislation tries to find positive solutions to the real problems that people face in villages, towns and cities throughout the country because they cannot renegotiate their rents.We are taking a realistic approach to the problem, backed by a sound body of legal opinion.  Deputy Kennedy's demand that we put our legal opinion before the House is merely a digression from the issues at hand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are aware that we are offering a genuine solution but they will not even entertain our attempt to build a positive outcome.  I remind Deputy White that the Bill seeks to address the emergency that has arisen in regard to upward-only rent reviews and the substantial economic havoc that such provisions are wreaking on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Rent reviews, which normally occur every five years, are resulting in the wind up of a large number of companies.  In many cases, liquidators are having to exercise special statutory powers to disclaim onerous leases and the effective abandonment of businesses results in substantial employment losses.  This Bill attempts to find a solution to this serious issue.  We are not giving anybody false hopes when we seek to find a way to help these businesses survive and flourish.I do not know if Deputy White received as many e-mails on this issue as I did.  I wish to share with her one such e-mail I received from a lady in Mallow who operates a small niche business called Fountain of Angels.  Her rent is €8,500 per annum.  She told me in her e-mail that the upward-only rent review clause is unfair and discriminates against tenants.  It is putting her under significant pressure and calls into question the viability of her business.  If she tries to leave, however, the landlord is entitled to pursue her for loss of income for the remainder of her lease, which happens to have a term of 11 years.  This situation is not helped by auctioneers who give misleading information and it reflects every e-mail we have received on this issue.  This is a real issue and it must be dealt with in a real political sense and that is what we seek to do tonight.Other matters that must be tackled include the hold on legal opinion and the hold that auctioneers, landlords and property owners have over people.  We should think more laterally about how to allow businesses to survive, a purpose at the heart of the Bill.  The proposals are perfectly realistic for people who live in the real world.  We do not contend that we are giving people false hope.  We are serious enough to put forward a Bill of this nature because we wish to tackle this issue realistically such that we can give small businesses an opportunity to flourish.  That is the motive from which this Bill emanates.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister would be better reacting to Deputy Gilmore's proposal.
