[<p eid="para_350">I apologise for not being here for all the interactions. Many of my questions have been addressed, so I will be very brief. I am very interested to hear Mr. Boland's and Mr. Maye's commentary. If I understand their statements correctly, they are saying the Sparkasse model would fill a gap in respect of lending. Could I get an understanding as to whether there is a geographical bias in this regard, so to speak? Are we talking about the midlands, the north west, the south west or the south east? If I understand Mr. Boland correctly, if there were a better lending model, there would be no need for another banking system. Do I understand him correctly, first, on the geographical considerations?</p>]
[<p eid="para_352">It does.</p>]
[<p eid="para_355">I take some comfort from the representative organisations' interventions today. If I read them correctly, they are stating they are open for business and ready to adopt new mechanisms to enhance their offerings and try to move into the very space referred to where there is a gap. The proof of this is, for instance, in CUMA and Mr. Molan's intervention on the 2016 regulations, in which he stated that in March commercial loans accounted for 1.9% of the â‚¬4.5 billion credit unions had out on loan, equivalent to 0.51% of their assets. Do the delegates take some comfort from these proceedings that there is scope, subject to a move by the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and, one hopes, these Houses, for the credit union movement to step in and plug that gap?</p>]
[<p eid="para_357">That is understood.</p>]
[<p eid="para_359">Mr. Boland can take it that that is understood.</p>]
[<p eid="para_361">Moving along very quickly, this is more of a general question which concerns the perception I would have had perhaps a year or so ago that the public perception was that credit unions were being put through the wringer by the Central Bank in terms of regulation. There was much discussion at this committee about that process. If I read the tone of the delegates' interventions today correctly, one senses that there has been some improvement in that relationship, or else they are couching their language in very careful terms. I do not know, but I would like to hear from the representative organisations about their perception of the relationship with the Central Bank in respect of regulation and the future of credit unions. Short interventions or answers will suffice. I will start with Mr. Johnson.</p>]
[<p eid="para_367">In the context of regulation, what is the state of the relationship between the Central Bank and the representative organisations?</p>]
