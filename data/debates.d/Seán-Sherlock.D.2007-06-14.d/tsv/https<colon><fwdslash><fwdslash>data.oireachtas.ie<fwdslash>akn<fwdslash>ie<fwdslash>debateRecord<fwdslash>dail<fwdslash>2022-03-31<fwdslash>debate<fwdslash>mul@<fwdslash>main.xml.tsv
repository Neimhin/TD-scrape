[<p eid="para_185">Is the Minister of State aware of the issues that are affecting the quality of ash for makers of hurleys? Is she aware the game of hurling has UNESCO intangible heritage status? I want to ensure a process is put in place to support the game of hurling on the basis that Canning Hurleys has announced it is closing today. It is a major hammer blow to the game of hurling in this country and I seek the Government's response to that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_189">I welcome the Minister of State's response. As I stated at the outset, the game of hurling is embedded in the Irish psyche and it has UNESCO intangible heritage status. When a family company like Canning Hurleys announced last week it is closing today, that was a hammer blow to everybody who loves the game of hurling, no matter what part of the country they are in, because the Canning family is synonymous with the game. Will the Minister of State convene a meeting with Croke Park, Teagasc, Coillte and the Irish Guild of Ash Hurley Makers as soon as possible? I note that meetings have taken place several times, as the Minister of State said. However, would she consider reconvening a meeting at the earliest possible opportunity as a matter of urgency to deal with supply issues? One of the supply lines comes from Ukraine and that makes the issue particularly urgent.</p>]
[<p eid="para_191">I welcome the Minister of State's willingness to do that. Will she inform the House when she proposes to write to them and set up that meeting because we cannot afford to lose hurley-makers? They are the supply lines, bloodlines and bloodstock of that sport. Will the Minister of State place a degree of urgency on this issue? It would be wonderful if we were to hear from her that she was convening, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of all the stakeholders as early as next week or the week after, for instance, such is the urgency of this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_193">If the Minister of State calls them all together, they will come. She should not worry as she has that power.</p>]
[<p eid="para_195">Hence the urgency.</p>]
