SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-01-24T13:30:00+00:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Dara Murphy and Senator Colette Kelleher. Members are requested to ensure that for the duration of the meeting their mobile phones are turned off or switched to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device used. It is not sufficient for them to leave them in silent mode as they maintain a level of interference with the broadcasting system.  I propose that we go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-01-24T14:00:00+00:00	The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00018/16. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00017/17 . It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to the petitioner, inform him of the Private Members' Bill, Waste Reduction Bill 2017, and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00042/17. It is proposed to deem the petition to be inadmissible, as set out in Dáil Standing Order 111C.(1)(f). Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00034/16. It is proposed to forward a copy of the Official Report on the debate in the Dáil on the motion to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00043/17 from Mr. Joseph O'Shea and entitled, Lack of Appeal Opportunity for Pension Assessment.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-01-24T14:00:00+00:00	I referred to Petition No. P00034/16 instead of Petition No. P00043/17. I thank the Deputy for correcting my mistake. I made an error by calling out the wrong number. I should have dealt with Petition No. P00043/17 before coming to petition No. P00034/16. Petition No. P00034/16 is from Mr. Joseph O'Shea on the lack of an appeal opportunity for a pension assessment. It is proposed that we correspond with the Department of Justice and Equality to ask it for clarification of the reason the decision of the Ombudsman has not been enforced; that we forward a copy of the response from the Pensions Ombudsman in the United Kingdom for the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality and suggest consideration be given to the powers of the Pensions Ombudsman in the United Kingdom, with a view to implementing the same or similar powers in Ireland and that we forward copies of all of the responses to the petitioner and leave the petition open. Is that agreed? Agreed.
