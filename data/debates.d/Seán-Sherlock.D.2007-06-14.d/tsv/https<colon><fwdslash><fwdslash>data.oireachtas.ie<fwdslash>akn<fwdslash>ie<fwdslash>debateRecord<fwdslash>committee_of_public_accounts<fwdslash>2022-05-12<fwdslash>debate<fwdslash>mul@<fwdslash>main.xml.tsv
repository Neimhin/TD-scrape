Any dealings I have had with her have always been honourable, honest and straightforward. Although very rarely have I agreed with her from a politically ideological position, I have to say that my dealings with her have always been honest, straightforward and forthright. Could I focus on the funding position in respect of the HEA? Based on correspondence we have received, we are given to understand that core funding amounting to €1.7 million has been withheld to date. Is that the current position?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-12T10:50:00+01:00	So contrary to media reports, no further moneys have been withheld.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-12T10:50:00+01:00	The reason I am asking Professor Mey this question is because right now, the educational landscape within the State is such that there are employees of universities or technological universities on precarious contracts. To my knowledge, there are not enough people in proper career progression. Many lecturers are still below the bar and are going from contract to contract. I speak for staff within the University of Limerick. It seems to me that if there is a withdrawal or holding back of funding, it stymies the ability of the university to fulfill its mission and obligations to its own staff but also its wider mission to the mid-west and Munster region. I say this as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation. I am very much aware of the work of EPI-STEM, Lero and other such entities and the translational effect of the research provided by the University of Limerick. I worry that if the HEA is withholding funding, it will have a downstream effect on the university's ability to allow staff to progress from below the bar to above the bar positions or to allow the university to ensure that people progress and that there is a career path for employees within the university. Is it the case that the holding back of this funding is affecting staff's ability to progress?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-12T11:00:00+01:00	Why have these moneys been paused? What reason was given in that conversation between the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the president?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-12T11:00:00+01:00	Moving on then to what are reasonably modest but significant sums nonetheless in respect of what has been spent on external consultancy costs and adviser fees, the university spent nearly €600,000 on project management services, total legal expenditure was €926,000, estate planning was €250,000, brand refresh and implementation was €87,000, and public relations was €33,000. This is all money that has been spent on external services. Will the president tell me why the university spending €595,000 on project management services and what are these services? That is my first question for her. Also, in respect of the brand refresh and implementation, €87,000 would pay the fees for one lecturer above the bar, if I can put it that way. My focus here is on staff and students, on what they are receiving and on what I would call their rights and entitlements. It seems to me the amount of money, which is approximately €3.1 million and is a significant amount, is all money that has been in spent on external services that could reasonably have been expected to be ploughed into investing in staff, educational output, and research output.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-05-12T11:00:00+01:00	Will the president speak specifically to the legal expenditure, because this is by far the greatest amount at €926,000? In 2019, the university spent €1.04 million on legal expenditure alone. It is a hell of a lot of money on legal fees.
