SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:40:00+00:00	I am delighted the witnesses are here today because this has given us much clarity and has probably answered some of the questions we had on the processes undertaken. The witnesses should know that neither our committee nor I have had access to or seen the report.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:40:00+00:00	This committee is flying blind. We had a sense from the Minister's interaction with us prior to Christmas that the HIQA recommendations were being worked through. I certainly had the impression from that interaction with her that that was as a result of work that had flowed from the witnesses report.My questions are about the terms of reference. We have been given an impression that observations were made by the witnesses that were outside the terms of reference of the report. What are their views on that? I am quoting the Minister directly. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	In response to a question from Deputy Rabbitte at the last committee meeting, the Minister stated:The report was written and conclusions, observations and recommendations were made. I answered Deputy Rabbitte's question about observations made that were outside the terms of reference and which went into policy issues. It was not provided for Oberstown House for people to review. People may have been named. People are named within the report. I ask Professor Hardwick to forgive me if he has answered this question already.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	On that basis, do the witnesses see any impediment, in the public interest, to this report coming into full public view?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	Again, I will quote from my own question to the Minister at our last committee meeting about this. I asked her "Was the process designed in such a way that if findings were made against persons or the entity, there would be a right of reply?" The Minister replied:Yes. They were asked to provide the report for the people concerned before there was a final report. That is what I am saying. From what I have heard so far, the witnesses are satisfied in their own minds that this actually took place and that they openly said that if anybody wanted to discuss the findings of the report, they would make themselves available to do so.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	The Minister did say following that-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	The Minister said:The Oberstown centre envisaged that the visit would take place before the reviewers finalised the report - that was included in the terms of reference - in order that comments could be taken into account in the final version of the report. However, the reviewers maintain that it would not have been possible to provide feedback until the final report had been completed. Is that what the Deputy wants to have published? The reviewers consider it to be final.I acknowledge the witnesses are repeating themselves. What I am trying to reconcile is that while we have not had access to the report, we do have access to the recommendations and we know that HIQA has had access to the report and there is a process of working through it. Ultimately all of this is to ensure that Oberstown is fit for purpose and there are robust procedures, protocols and standard operating procedures.  If there is still a sword of Damocles hanging over Oberstown in respect of this report, we are trying to tease out the fair procedure the Minister told us about in this committee. As she has not published the report, she must have received advices against publishing it. We are trying to reconcile that with the fact that to our minds, the public good is not being served by not publishing the report to date. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	Does Professor Hardwick think the board of Oberstown has nothing to fear from the publication of the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	I mean from a personal responsibility point of view.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T10:50:00+00:00	And to embrace it. As a final question, I wish to ask about the methodology. Professors Hardwick and Goldson are both academics and most of us in this House are not, although we have interfaced with academics. Can the witnesses give us confidence that the methodology they used was in line with international best practice? I am not questioning their bona fides. There may be others who would come before this committee and question the methodology. I want to be sure in my mind that the methodology is robust.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T11:00:00+00:00	I thank Professor Goldson.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T11:00:00+00:00	Professor Goldson made a point about the Minister's interaction in respect of the legal advice. I will go back and quote directly what the Minister said:I have indicated in terms of the legal advice as well as the experience of the board, the staff and my officials, that fair procedures were not followed. Therefore there is a lack of fairness there, which leads to the legal risks, which is why there is not a publication.I do not in any way wish to put words in Professor Goldson's mouth but perhaps he can enlighten us. Does he agree with that statement?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T11:00:00+00:00	Okay, so there is no reason from a legal standpoint for the report not to be published.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T11:00:00+00:00	To be helpful, the legal advice to the Minister is from the Attorney General's office and we do not have access to that legal advice in this House.Therefore, one can assume the representatives of Oberstown do not have access to that legal advice either. It would be contrary to the law. On that basis, my understanding is that the Minister has discretion, on the basis of the advice, as to whether to publish. What we are hearing here, based on what has been an enlightening interaction with the delegates, is that there is now a clear need for the report to be published and put in the public domain so the questions that arise may be answered satisfactorily and so members of this committee can make some determination as to their interpretation of matters.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:00:00+00:00	This is a political domain, not a legal one. To reiterate the points made previously, we do not have sight of the report. However, we do have sight of the recommendations and take in good faith the statements made in respect of the implementation of those recommendations. What we find hard to reconcile is the non-publication of the report. I listened very carefully to Professor Kilkelly in respect of the constitutional element in terms of implicating people in the report. I appreciate that dynamic because Professor Kilkelly states that while nobody was specifically identified, the language of the report could be deemed to identify individuals. In light of what Professor Kilkelly said, what was the exact nature of the independent advice given to the board?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:00:00+00:00	What was the nature of the independent advice given to the board? Could she be more specific about it? What was the nature of the interactions with the Minister or her officials regarding that independent advice? When the Minister appeared before us, she stated that she had been advised by the board that its decision not to publish the report of the operational review was not one it either expected or wanted to make and that it resulted from a lengthy, careful and extensive process of consideration that weighed up the legal risks associated with publication in light of the independent legal advice. We are in the political domain and we perceive that the non-publication of the report could arguably be perceived to be covering up or protecting practice, culture or individuals. We need some reassurance from Professor Kilkelly that the board's independent legal advice is robust and some greater articulation of what Professor Kilkelly means by the implications of that advice.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	Could I ask Professor Kilkelly to hold it there? In light of that very statement, was an opportunity given to those individuals, or were discussions held with them with a view to interacting with the two eminent experts in respect of the content and language of the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	That is not what I asked.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	There is a tendency sometimes in this House to go after people and witnesses. The dynamic of this committee has been such that it has been very patient on this issue. We seek to ensure witnesses' bona fides are respected. That is why we need very clear, succinct and simple language. My question was very simple. I want to know whether the individuals who might be implicated by virtue of the language of the report were given an opportunity to interact with the eminent professors in respect of the report's content or the implications of the language used in the report. Yes or no?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	I believe Professor Kilkelly used the word "property" in respect of the report.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	I am just quoting the professor and she may correct me if I am wrong. She said the report is the property of those who commissioned it. On that basis, who owns the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	The board owns the report. If the board owns it, notwithstanding the issues of timing, the fact that the committee has demanded the publication of the report, and our interactions with the Minister, is there still scope and time, on the basis of the evidence of Professors Goldson and Hardwick in respect of their willingness to engage at all levels and with all stakeholders, to go over the report again and work through its content if it is deemed that there are adverse findings against or implications for certain individuals? From my perspective in seeking to address the issues concerning the recommendations published in July 2017, even if those recommendations are implemented, the sword of Damocles of this report will still be hanging over us. As I said at the outset, we are in the political domain, not the legal domain. Reports perceived to have been suppressed always get published, one way or another. I say respectfully to Professor Kilkelly that I perceive defensiveness here on the part of the board. I did not perceive the same defensiveness on the part of Professors Goldson and Hardwick. This is perception; it is reality in the political domain. Both sides need to go through this report again and find some common ground, irrespective of whether this process is brokered by the Minister or someone else. One way or another, the report will have to be published. The public interest absolutely demands it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	Is there not a contradiction there? Professor Kilkelly is saying findings have been reached. Has she not accepted the findings and content of the report on the basis that she is implementing its recommendations?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:10:00+00:00	Arguably, then, the report is not a final report.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:40:00+00:00	I have a question before Professor Kilkelly concludes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:50:00+00:00	I will reinforce the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. Correspondence was made available on 13 November 2017 as a result of a freedom of information request. The board had received legal advice on 13 March 2017. The correspondence is from a principal officer, who I will not name, in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It stated that the Department was of the view that the following are mechanisms to progress matters in order to ensure that the matters raised by the board were addressed. This is the independent legal advice. There follows a set of proposals. The first was a response to the authors of the report pointing out the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management of Oberstown in order to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard. Alternatively, the board of management of Oberstown campus could make a submission on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the joint Oireachtas committee along with the report. To reinforce Deputy Daly's point, members are very much of the view that everything was done to try to facilitate the board, either through further engagement with the authors of the report or through the legal mechanisms of the highest offices of the State, to publish the report, yet it refused to do so on the basis of its own independent legal advice. The arguments the witnesses are making do not hold water.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:50:00+00:00	The board decided not to go along with that suggestion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T12:50:00+00:00	I placed on record the contents of the Department's correspondence with Professor Kilkelly. By any interpretation, the Department was seeking to suggest further engagement with the staff and management to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard. Notwithstanding the point that a finding had been made, which Professor Kilkelly made previously, there was still scope for further engagement with the various stakeholders before the publication of the report. Professor Kilkelly seems to be saying that in spite of those suggestions, the board decided to proceed on the basis of its independent legal advice. A pathway was being sought for the board but it refused to take it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-01-30T13:00:00+00:00	Fair procedure has been the defence here. I believe that Professor Kilkelly's argument in respect of the findings militated against fair procedure. The Department made an offer to the board of Oberstown to discuss the issue of fair procedures. Professor Kilkelly is saying the board took up that offer. I do not understand her answer to that, because the evidence we heard from Professors Goldson and Hardwick today would suggest otherwise, namely, that there was no further qualitative engagement with them on the issue of fair procedures. It is very hard to find Professor Kilkelly's answer to be credible.
