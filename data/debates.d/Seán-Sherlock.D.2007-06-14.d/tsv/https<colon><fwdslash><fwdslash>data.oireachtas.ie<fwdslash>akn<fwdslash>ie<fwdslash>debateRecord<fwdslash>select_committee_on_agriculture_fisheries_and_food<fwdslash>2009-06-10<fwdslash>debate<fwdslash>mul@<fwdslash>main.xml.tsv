[<p eid="para_59">I welcome the Minister and his officials.  The €3.4 billion spend on agriculture is sizeable.  We have hammered out many of the issues on milk quotas, the farm waste management scheme and other schemes in this committee.  I will not speak specifically to those matters.</p>, <p eid="para_60">The Teagasc budget has been on my mind for some time.  I seek information on the research component of Teagasc's operation.  I understand €182 million is allocated for that purpose.  Is a value for money mechanism built into research spend?  What is the return on investment?  For instance, when there is a call for a proposal which is funded by the taxpayer via Teagasc for a specific scientific proposal, what is the success rate for those proposals within Teagasc?  What is the failure rate?  How much money is spent on research?  How is that targeted?  Is there an economic return on that investment down the line?  What has been the return to the Exchequer on Department investment in co-operatives for the purpose of microbiological research, particularly into derivatives of milk products?  While I do not suggest it is a black hole and that the money is ill spent, I would like to understand more about how that system works, particularly when it comes to scientific calls for proposals under the Teagasc heading.</p>, <p eid="para_61">I ask the Minister to elaborate on programme 5 because it is stated that the costs in this area relate entirely to the administrative budget and that there is an ongoing review of operations to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services.  Is it the Minister's view that the staff component in the Department is currently operating at capacity throughout the State?  Should there be fewer staff and what action is being taken to make savings in this regard?</p>, <p eid="para_62">I also want to discuss the €200 million in increases in fishing quotas in 2008 secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I may have missed it but is there a statement on the fisheries output for 2009 to 2010, as a result of that increase in quota?   I am trying to get an idea as to whether fishermen will get more money over the next period.  What is the state of play for fisheries?</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">I would like to respond to the last point the Minister made, which related to the need to secure value for money when reviews and forms of research are undertaken.  I take the point he made about Moorepark.  We are all very proud of Moorepark.  The Minister is stating the obvious in that regard.  I say that with respect to the Minister's position.  How much money is the taxpayer spending on agricultural research?  What is the rate of return on that investment?  It might not be possible to answer that question today.  The scientific community can respond to calls for proposals and can benefit from funding streams from sources like the European Union, private equity, the co-operative movement and industry.  How much money does the Irish taxpayer spend on funding that research?  What is the return on that investment to the Irish taxpayer?  I appreciate that the Minister might not be able to answer that specific question today.  Perhaps he can provide that information at a future meeting of this committee.  He may be able to arrange for me to get a briefing on the matter.  I want to get a sense of it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_92">That is my point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_94">It must have commercial value.</p>]
