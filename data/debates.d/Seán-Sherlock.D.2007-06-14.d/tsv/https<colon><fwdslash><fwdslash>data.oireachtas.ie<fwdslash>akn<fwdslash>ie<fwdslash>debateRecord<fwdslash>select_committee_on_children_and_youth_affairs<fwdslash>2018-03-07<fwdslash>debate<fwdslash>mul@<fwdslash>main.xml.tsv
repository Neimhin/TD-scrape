SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T09:50:00+00:00	I have some general, broad-stroke questions. Is now an appropriate time to ask them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T09:50:00+00:00	I have to ask some hard questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T09:50:00+00:00	Do I have the floor, Chairman? I am happy to yield to Deputy Rabbitte if she has a question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:00:00+00:00	I have it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:10:00+00:00	Not on that issue. I have a number of questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:10:00+00:00	There are a couple of key policy issues. I want to comment on how those policy outputs map across the appropriations. My first question relates to the affordable child care scheme. We know there is significant staff turnover in child care facilities; some estimates put the figure at as high as 30%. How do we address this high rate of turnover? The overheads and administrative burdens in individual facilities are increasing. Can anything be done about that? Does the Minister have a perspective on how we can address the high rate of turnover, given the high level of qualifications within the sector? Is there a mechanism to build in possible budgets for individual facilities to account for the increased overhead as a result of administrative costs? Could the Minister allow for some provision to be made for continuous professional development? It is a key factor in any career. I understand some segments within the sector are asking for up to five days for some provision to be made for that. I ask for a perspective from the Minister on where the policy is going in respect of all of these challenges.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:10:00+00:00	Another issue is communications. There has been some controversy - if I can use that term - about the SCU. It was reported by Hugh O'Connell in The Sunday Business Post that on July 9 the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, responded to a memo stating that the child care subsidy scheme being announced by the Government later in the summer should be a key campaign run by the SCU. He is quoted as saying, "Again, should be a thing the Govt is doing for you, not the Dept of Children &Youth ... I think there should be a campaign run on this throughout August." I note the Minister has made some comments in the public domain about possible interaction with the Taoiseach on this. I want to glean from the Minister who is in control of the Department's communications. Is it now a function of the SCU? Will it become a function of the SCU if it is not currently such a function or is the Minister in control of her budget line which, as I understand it, totals approximately €113,000 if the FOI figure is to be believed? I cannot see the specific figure in the Estimates. Perhaps the Minister might assist us with that. I would make the case that the Minister and her Department should be in control of the communications strategy. If the interaction between the sector and all of its constituent parts is close to the Minister in terms of relationships I do not see the need for that to be elevated to the Department of the Taoiseach which is at another remove. There is a political issue in terms of control and it is more of a political question for the Minister.  I refer to the allocation for Tusla. To be fair to the Minister, she has secured some €754 million for Tusla, an increase of €40 million. In my mind I find it difficult to reconcile the increase in the budget for Tusla and the number of HIQA reports coming into the public domain across a wide range of issues. I am trying to glean whether the HIQA reports are being acted upon on a regional basis and when we can expect success in respect of the recommendations in each of the HIQA reports.  I tabled a parliamentary question seeking information on the number of social workers in the system. The response I got was that there was an average of ten years duration in career length. It is a tough job and I can understand that there is a high rate of attrition in the sector for all sorts of reasons. Is there something in the Minister's vision which will speak to the budget lines before us and address the decline in numbers over a longer-term period? Is the Minister liaising with other Departments to see how we can encourage more people to become social workers and social care workers? They are key personnel and act as an interface between the challenges the sector faces and outputs. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:20:00+00:00	How do the individual providers bid for the €18 million to help with the administrative burden?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:20:00+00:00	The Minister has pushed back on that issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:20:00+00:00	I also asked about the high turnover of staff, especially social workers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:30:00+00:00	Three months is a quarter of a year in effect. I would like further clarification of the figures of 45, 57, nine and 53. I think the Minister mentioned 45 social workers, 57-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:30:00+00:00	With regard to the figure of nine, I did not quite pick up the-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:30:00+00:00	That is the key one I wanted to zone in on. With regard to the nine nursing staff, the Minister may be aware of Barnardos' "Lost" campaign, which is quite an impactful campaign. One of its asks arising from that is that there would be a dedicated child and family public health system with guaranteed home visits. I know that technically this is not the Minister's area but I ask for some engagement between the Department and the Department of Health on this issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:30:00+00:00	Yes, because we all know the value of public health nurses, we know exactly what they do and we know they are extremely good at picking up signs within a family home. If there was a facility whereby there were more home visits, it would have a very strong longitudinal effect because we know that sometimes home visits stop after a certain period of time once a child is born. Starting off at home, Barnardos asks what can done to ensure all children have a good start and suggests introducing a dedicated child and family public nurse system with guaranteed home visits. I did not give the Minister notice of my intention to ask this question but I would like to hear her perspective, whether she feels that this is something that is worth pursuing and whether she might engage with the Department of Health or the Minister for Health with a view to seeing whether work could be carried out between the two Departments on this issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:40:00+00:00	Will the Minister report back to us on the progress on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-03-07T10:40:00+00:00	I thank the Minister and her officials for attending the meeting.
