[<p eid="para_45">I welcome the delegation to the committee meeting.  At the last meeting the credit unions' role in society was acknowledged.</p>, <p eid="para_46">Is there a gulf in the positions on the regulatory framework between the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, and the CUDA?  I remain to be convinced about the ILCU's position.  The only way one can guarantee that individual members have maximum security for their deposits is through the auspices of the Central Bank commission.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_47">The opening statement stated:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_48">"CUDA believes the current structure is appropriate.  The performance and future development of credit unions needs to be underpinned by a properly resourced, separate and differentiated system of statutory regulation for the credit union sector within the overall Central Bank and the Department of Finance structure."</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_49">Will the delegation clarify exactly what this means?</p>, <p eid="para_50">The CUDA obviously recognises the role of the Registrar of Credit Unions but it is also seeking to differentiate between its role and that of the banks while keeping under the umbrella of the Central Bank.  Are the credit unions happy reporting to the assistant director general under the Financial Regulator's office?  Would it suggest any modifications to this system?</p>, <p eid="para_51">Mr. Mark Bailey of the ILCU told me at the last meeting that it had been in negotiations with the Department concerning the provisions governing the percentage and periods for loans in section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997.  He said the Minister will shortly sign an order which will increase the percentage provision to 30%.  Some people I have spoken to informally about this have reservations about it from a liquidity perspective.  It is important the committee fleshes this out if it is going to take a rational long-term view on it.  How would such a proposal impact on the CUDA?  It represents 275,000 credit union members through 11 credit unions.</p>, <p eid="para_52">Credit unions offer mainstream financial services including savings, loans, various insurance, foreign exchange, ATM cards, electronic funds transfer payments, child benefit and social welfare payments, mortgages in limited cases and other mainstream financial services.  It is impossible to see how anyone can justify a different regime of regulation for one set of industry operatives such as banks and building societies and argue for a lesser form of protection to apply to credit unions when they are dealing in the exact same products.  Ultimately, the committee is left with the ILCU, representative of the majority of credit unions, and the CUDA.  The committee wants a system that both bodies will buy into and that will stand up to scrutiny.</p>]
[<p eid="para_62">Increasing the loan percentage allowed from 20% to 30% would allow a credit union a greater degree of flexibility in individual loans.  For instance, if I had a car loan with my credit union but was put to the pin of my collar financially, I could extend the loan's lifetime.  What are the permutations for individual credit unions?  If there are still difficulties with extending it by 10%, what is the optimal solution?</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">Section 35 needs to be clarified then.  The extension from 20% to 30% is not providing the panacea.  The committee may need further clarification on this matter from departmental officials or the Minister about this proposal.</p>]
