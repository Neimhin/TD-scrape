This €5m was for the provision of e-Journals, which allows scientific researchers access to key databases, to assist them in conducting their work. This was not an additional cost to the Exchequer in 2011.The indicative SFI allocation for 2012 is as follows:Capital/Research Grants allocation is €156m.Current expenditure/Pay allocation is €4.40m.Current expenditure/Non-Pay cost allocation to run SFI programmes is €4.49m.The number of researchers supported in each year from 2004-2011 is set out in a table:YearNumber of Researchers directly supported by SFI20041,06720051,61020061,36220072,40920082,80620093,22520102,99920113,000 (estimated)In 2012 the capital provision of €156m to SFI will allow it to retain support for the current levels of approximately 3,000 researchers and 28 research centres, subject to a number of factors including the quality and strategic relevance of new grant applications received.There are no changes to qualifying conditions for funding arising from the Budget.
