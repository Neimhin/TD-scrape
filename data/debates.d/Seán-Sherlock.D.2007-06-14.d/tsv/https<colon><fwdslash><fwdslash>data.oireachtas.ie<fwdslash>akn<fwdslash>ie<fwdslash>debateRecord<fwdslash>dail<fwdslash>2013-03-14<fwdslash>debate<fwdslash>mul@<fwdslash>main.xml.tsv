[<p eid="para_323">I am standing in for the Minister for Justice and Equality who is abroad on business. Both he and I have been greatly encouraged by the level of support expressed by Members for the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions) Bill 2012. It is historic legislation that is at one with other initiatives aimed at making our criminal justice system work better for society. We want to reduce crime, see offenders caught and brought to justice. We want them to undergo whatever sanctions the courts impose, not from desire for revenge but to ensure those who offend against society pay their debt to society for doing so.</p>, <p eid="para_324"> Many issues were raised during Second Stage which I am confident will be dealt with by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on Committee Stage. Deputy McNamara raised the issue of the T case of which the Department of Justice and Equality is aware. However, it is our understanding that the UK Government will appeal it to the Supreme Court. The Department will consider the implications, if any, of the final determination of that case for our vetting arrangements and for this Bill. The UK system of vetting is very different to ours and direct comparisons are not necessarily correct. This can be revisited on Committee Stage.</p>, <p eid="para_325"> On the point raised by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Ryan, the Bill was amended in the Seanad to provide for the situation they outlined. Where a person is convicted for more than one offence regarding one incident, it is to be treated as one order of conviction under section 2(4).</p>, <p eid="para_326"> I thank Members for their contributions. The Minister and I appreciate the general welcome given to this Bill. All the suggestions as to how it could be improved will be considered on Committee Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_327">I move:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_328">That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality pursuant to Standing Order 82A3(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business and paragraph (8) of the Orders of Reference of Select Committees.</p>]
[<p eid="para_530">I beg the Deputy's indulgence. I am taking all four of the issues today but I am awaiting a response on the Deputy's particular issue. With the permission of Deputy Ã“ Snodaigh and the Acting Chairman I would be obliged if I could buy some time and move on to the next issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_532">Sorry about that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_541">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue for discussion. I am taking the matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. </p>, <p eid="para_542"> Tuam mental health service caters for the Tuam and Headford catchment areas, with a population of approximately 35,000 and a caseload in excess of 800 people. Traditionally, the service was provided at St. Brigid's Hospital in east Galway but gradually during the years community mental health services in Tuam and Headford have been developed. A report on fire safety in Toghermore House was delivered to the HSE in December 2012. It highlighted a number of shortfalls in fire safety which needed to be addressed as a priority. The assessment focused on relevant issues, including means of escape and associated signage and plans; structural fire precautions and fire equipment; coverage provided by fire alarm and emergency lighting systems; and facilities for the fire service.</p>, <p eid="para_543"> A local steering group consisting of a mental health clinical director, a consultant psychiatrist, a director of nursing, an occupational therapy manager, a business manager, a team leader social worker and a patient representative was formed by the HSE and met to address the challenges outlined in the report. The steering group is liaising with residents and their families as part of the process. HSE West has implemented improved fire risk assessment and hazard identification measures. All staff and patients have been informed that appropriate actions have been taken such as a complete ban on smoking in and around the residence structure and improved observations in all areas. To mitigate immediate risks, the HSE is installing a fire alarm system and continues to have hourly fire checks. Preparatory work for the fire alarm system has now been completed and the work is being carried out with minimum disruption to the daily routine of residents.</p>, <p eid="para_544"> The executive is commissioning a full review of all 24 hour residential facilities in counties Galway and Roscommon. The outcome of this review will assist in its determination of future requirements for mental health services in these geographic areas. The membership of an expert group to oversee this review is being finalised by the area manager and the executive clinical director. It is expected that the review will be completed within a 12 week period from the date of commission. It should be noted that no other mental health services in the Tuam complex or surrounding areas are affected by the fire safety issue. These facilities include the day hospital, day centre, training centre and workshop, primary care, CAMHS and out-patient and psychiatry of later life services, which continue to operate as normal. The Deputy can rest assured that the responsible Ministers will continue to closely monitor developments on this issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_547">I agree with the Deputy that it is farcical for one Minister of State to respond to four issues. However, I know the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Reilly, would engage directly with him on his questions about who is on the steering group and the details of costs and timelines. I note, however, that the patients are represented on the group and, if the process is working properly, it should address the needs of patients and their families. I tend to agree with the Deputy on the issue. I have had similar experiences in my own area and ensured the regional director of operations was answerable to me on any issue arising. I recognise that it is important to raise these issues in the House and apologise to the Deputy for my lack of intimate knowledge of them.</p>]
[<p eid="para_553">I thank the Deputy for his earlier forbearance. I have now been provided with a reply from the Minister of Social Protection, who is out of the country at this time.</p>, <p eid="para_554"> Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to a jobseeker's payment. Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an ongoing basis is not entitled to such payment. Obviously, to be fair to the gentleman mentioned by the Deputy, that does not apply in his case.</p>, <p eid="para_555"> Unlike other jobseekers, who must sign off the live register on any day on which they find work, part-time firefighters are paid a jobseeker's payment in respect of days on which they are engaged in firefighting or training. They are, however, required to satisfy other statutory conditions for the receipt of a jobseeker's payment - that is, they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work. In this respect, deciding officers do not treat them differently from any other jobseeker. I accept the point the Deputy has made in this regard, but I do not have the full details of the case to hand.</p>, <p eid="para_556"> With regard to dealing with the systemic issue, I am familiar with the problems. In my area of Cork we have part-time firefighters and similar circumstances apply. Given the vagaries of this type of employment, issues relating to the eligibility of firefighters for jobseeker's payments have been raised with the Department of Social Protection on numerous occasions over the years. Taking account of the unusual circumstances of these workers and general efforts to develop and standardise the jobseeker schemes, a group was established in the Department to examine the position of firefighters. While the work of this group is largely completed, issues relating to firefighters remain under consideration in the Department. Key to these considerations will be recognition of the very valuable service this group of workers provide to their local communities. However, it is also important that the integrity of the jobseeker scheme is maintained. Achieving a balance in this regard will include recognising the important service these workers provide and the contribution they make to the safety of communities across the country.</p>]
[<p eid="para_559">Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It would do no harm were the Deputy to refer the case of Gavin Burns to the Minister for reference as part of the ongoing review process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_564">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the typing and issuing of transcripts of X-ray reports. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health. It is important to assure people attending the radiology unit at Tallaght hospital that there is no risk to patient safety. Urgent and prioritised reports in the emergency department and the paediatric radiology unit are produced within 24 hours. Tallaght hospital has in place a documented clinical governance process for radiologists, the doctors who examine x-rays. Urgent cases and cases in need of time-sensitive clinical decisions are flagged in advance by clinicians for immediate reporting. Critical or urgent findings are immediately brought to the attention of the referring doctors and the clerical staff who transcribe and send the report immediately.</p>, <p eid="para_565"> An average of 15,000 reports are typed at Tallaght hospital each month. Standard non-urgent reports are usually produced within two or three weeks. The number of reports that need to be typed has increased due to initiatives to improve access to imaging. More patients are receiving radiography examinations in Tallaght because of higher productivity and better facilities. For example, a second CT scanner was opened in December 2012. An initiative with Naas General Hospital reduced the MRI waiting list by 16% in 16 weeks. Some 6,000 examinations, or 3.5% of the annual total of 172,000, are currently untyped. Some 3,000 of these untyped reports relate to patients who attended routine outpatient imaging. They have been reported through an initiative with additional consultant resources. The remaining untyped examinations date from 12 February last to the current day. As the standard turnaround time for routine reports is two to three weeks, these tapes are currently delayed by a further two or three weeks.</p>, <p eid="para_566"> The radiology department, the diagnostic directorate and the executive team are taking a number of steps to address this issue. Additional clerical support is being provided in the radiology unit to assist with the typing of tapes. It is intended that the backlog will be cleared in approximately five weeks. The hospital has initiated demand management protocols within national guidelines to avoid the need for reports on specific images such as orthopaedics. An integrated voice recognition system that was piloted last year will be introduced from early April. This will eliminate the need to type transcripts for approximately 65% of the radiology workload. It is expected that voice recognition for all reporting in Tallaght will be fully implemented by the first quarter of 2014 as part of the roll-out of the national integrated medical imaging system. This will eliminate the need to transcribe radiology reports.</p>]
[<p eid="para_568">I will do so. I acknowledge everything that has been said.</p>]
[<p eid="para_577">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.</p>, <p eid="para_578"> Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. Any of us who have served on local authorities would acknowledge the point Deputy Lyons has made in this regard. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The annual rate on valuation, ARV, which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.</p>, <p eid="para_579"> The Government has no plans at this juncture to introduce a temporary levy on large out-of-town retail operations. In terms of planning policy, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, published new development contribution guidelines in January 2012. The new guidelines build on the experience gained in recent years and also align development contribution policy with the Government's prioritisation of employment creation, investment and sustainable development, a point the Deputy addressed in his contribution. Above all, the guidelines are intended to support proper planning and sustainable development while also prioritising job creation and economic investment.</p>, <p eid="para_580"> All in this House, across the political spectrum, are aware of the pressures on small and medium enterprises and intergenerational businesses in places like Naas and Finglas, to which the Deputy referred. In that context, local authorities have been asked by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, by way of a circular letter, to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2013. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and, in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012.</p>, <p eid="para_581"> The Deputy referred to the Government's action programme for effective local government, Putting People First. This indicated that, in the context of reorganisation of local governance structures, the proposed new municipal districts will provide an opportunity to achieve a more coherent approach to rates and charges on a county-wide basis, having regard to funding requirements and the need to support employment and business competitiveness. To be honest, I do not know how that dynamic will work in Finglas and it is probably easier to map that potential in terms of counties such as Cork, where there are distinct municipal areas that do not border on a large metropolitan area. It will be a challenge, and I acknowledge the Deputy's point in this regard. The action programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between ARVs of towns and counties. The Minister's approach to rates harmonisation will seek to ensure, on the one hand, that harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties, with consequential implications for services, and, on the other hand, that increases in rates do not impact negatively on businesses and employment.</p>, <p eid="para_582"> The Minister has informed me that he will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review and that he is determined every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector.</p>]
[<p eid="para_587">I am getting a bit peckish thinking of Four Star Pizza. It is a long way to Cork. I might pop in. On a serious note, I concur with what the Deputy is saying. We are seeing that effect throughout the landscape. There are factors other than rates influencing that dynamic. The Deputy is right about out-of-town multiples being able to house all products across a broad spectrum, which is certainly having an effect on smaller towns and villages.</p>, <p eid="para_588"> Smaller towns and villages must be creative because consumption has modified considerably. Conspicuous consumption has virtually flat-lined and we might have to be more creative about how we re-imagine town centres and villages. I take the point the Deputy is making.</p>]
