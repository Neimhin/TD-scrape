SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I propose to share my time with Deputies Bernard Durkan, Willie Penrose and Mary O'Rourke.  As I spoke on this issue last week, I propose to yield to Deputy Durkan at this stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is a democracy and there is a wide range of views in our party.  Does the Minister acknowledge that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Did the Minister get advice from the Attorney General on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What is the Attorney General's advice on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Three times last week we supported them.  The Minister should get his facts right.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are seeing the Minister's true colours.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I seek clarification on the Minister's amendment No. 1, which states in paragraph (2) that a person who hunts deer with two or more dogs shall be guilty of an offence, but in paragraph (3) states it shall not be an offence for a person on foot to hunt deer with two or more dogs, under and in accordance with section 29 and section 42.  To satisfy my thirst for knowledge on the Minister's line of thinking on this, will he clarify for the House what is in and what is out?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Sections 2 and 3 are related in this sense, begging the Acting Chairman's indulgence.  We want clarification from the Minister on his position on other types of deer hunting.  What is on his mind in respect of other types of deer hunting?  It is still a little unclear.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister's own Deputy said that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is a patronising statement if ever I heard one.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is like a counselling session.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	This is surreal.
