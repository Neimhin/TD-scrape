[<p eid="para_689">I welcome the motion and support it. I welcome the Minister of State's response because there is a tacit acknowledgement of the challenge that faces all of us in respect of the provision of services through CAMHS. I think everybody accepts the report of the Mental Health Commission and the recommendations therein. I am particularly taken by the part of the Minister of State's speech where she refers to CAMHS teams. She said:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_690">CAMHS teams receive and triage nearly 21,000 referrals annually and deliver 225,000 appointments for children and young people requiring assessment and intervention each year. Between 2020 and 2021, CAMH services have experienced a 33% increase in demand, while concurrently increasing their activity levels, seeing 21% more cases during the same period.</p>, <p eid="para_691">They are extraordinary figures when you think about it. They present a picture of the enormity of the challenge that faces all of us in respect of ensuring that, where somebody needs access to a service in an acute setting or on an acute basis, they have that pathway within that 24 to 48 hour period. When there is a threat to life, there are so many pathways to save a life in conventional medicine. If there is a road traffic accident, the ambulance is called, you go to the nearest trauma centre and the resources are there to save life and limb straight away. When it comes to mental health, it is just not there. It is not guaranteed to the same extent.</p>, <p eid="para_692"> I have sympathy for the position in which the Ministers of State find themselves. If I was Sinn Féin I would not be making promises or guaranteeing being able to fix this because it will be a long, slow road. However, the Mental Health Commission's report is very clear in respect of the regulation of CAMHS. This has always been a key point for us. There is an inconsistency in the service depending on where people live in the country. I live in CHO 4. The figures for CHO 4, which is the Cork and Kerry region, are frightening. I raised this in a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and got my reply on 25 January. I asked for the number of persons waiting to be seen by child and adolescent mental health services by CHO and LHO and the length of time they were waiting. There are 857 people waiting in total in the Cork and Kerry region. That is too many people. There are 296 waiting over a year in the Cork and Kerry region. This is from 25 January so that is the most up-to-date figure there is.</p>]
[<p eid="para_694">There is a glaring inconsistency between what is happening in the Cork and Kerry region and the Galway region, if I am being a bit cheeky about it, or the Waterford region. The figures are incomparable.</p>]
[<p eid="para_696">In CHO 1, the Donegal region, there are 603 people waiting longer than 12 months whereas in CHO 2, the Galway region or the west of Ireland, there are 24. To go back to my earlier point, if someone presents to a hospital with an acute medical condition, they will get their surgery or intervention, they will get the medicine they need and they will get it pretty much straight away once they are inside the door of the hospital, primary care setting or secondary care setting. When it comes to mental health services for children and adolescents, that same level of urgency does not exist. The point made by the Mental Health Commission on the regulation of CAMHS is important because we need that consistency of approach. The Minister of State is saying that the revised mental health Bill should make provision for that. I am not sure where that Bill is or when it is supposed to come before us - I ask the Minister of State to respond to that question - but that provision needs to be nailed down. It is not fair that the people in Cork and Kerry have to wait so much longer than people in another part of the country. We should not have that inconsistency. The service should not discriminate against people based on their geography. We all face scenarios as public representatives, Deputies and Senators, on a daily basis where families approach us.</p>, <p eid="para_697">We pick up the phone to the chief officer of the CHO or whoever it might be. These are all inherently good people who want to help us. In some cases, it has taken my intervention with somebody of standing within the HSE on behalf of a family to get access to a service. Family members tell me about a young man or woman who has suicidal ideation and after my intervention, an appointment is made and the young person in question is back in the system. If the system were working correctly, it would not take an intervention by a Deputy, Senator or councillor for someone to get access to a service.</p>]
[<p eid="para_699">That is wrong. There are many people out there - and I do not mean this in a patronising way - who may not have the capacity to advocate or the wherewithal to phone their local public representatives. They should not have to do that to get access to a service.</p>, <p eid="para_700"> This is such a sensitive issue that one does not wish to be political or partisan about it but we are not seeing an improvement in the waiting lists, year on year. What the report of the Mental Health Commission showed us was illustrative, but it probably just crystallised our experiences, as public representatives, of mental health services. It did not tell us anything we did not already know. Many of us have been experiencing the CAMHS phenomenon for many years. I was provided with figures for waiting lists on 16 September 2022. The information was separated into people who had been waiting for an appointment for less than 12 weeks, between 12 and 26 weeks, between 26 and 39 weeks, between 39 and 52 weeks and more than 52 weeks. The total was 4,127. The figure as of 25 January was 4,293. The numbers on waiting lists are increasing. I take the point the Minister of State made that there has been a massive increase in the demand for services and that the number of appointments stands at approximately 250,000. However, we are not keeping ahead of the game and ensuring that people can get through the front door, in the first instance. It has been all of our experiences that once people get in through the front door, services start to wrap around them.</p>, <p eid="para_701"> Why in the name of goodness have we spent €15 million on recruitment agencies? That money has been spent by the HSE on recruitment agencies to recruit for posts that are vacant. The Ministers of State should intervene. Taxpayers are not getting a return on their investment via the HSE. We are spending €15 million on recruitment agencies to recruit for the HSE to fill the posts that need to be filled in the areas we are talking about. That needs to be looked at. We must ask where is the value for money and the return on that investment for the taxpayer. Why are these posts not being filled?</p>, <p eid="para_702"> We stand in this Chamber, week in and week out, and talk about the recruitment crisis. Is there a way to level the playing field between CHOs? Where there is some capacity in one CHO, can it be transferred to another CHO where there is an acute level of need? That could be done as we compare and contrast services. We have all now moved online. God forbid, but if I were looking for an intervention tomorrow and the service I required was in Sligo, I could have an online intervention. The tools of the trade are there to make that happen. In the interim, I am asking that we make services available to people. Even if they are made available as online resources or tools to begin with, it would be a start to ensure we level the playing field for the people I represent in the Cork-Kerry region, which has already been the subject of much controversy. We do not want any more.</p>]
