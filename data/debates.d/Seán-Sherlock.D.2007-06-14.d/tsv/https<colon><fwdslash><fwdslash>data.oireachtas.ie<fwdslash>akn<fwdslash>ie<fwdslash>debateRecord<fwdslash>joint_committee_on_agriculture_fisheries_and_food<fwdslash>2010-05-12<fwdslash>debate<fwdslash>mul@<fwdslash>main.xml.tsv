[<p eid="para_18">On that point I anticipate that today we will have a statement from Mr. Moran and his colleagues which will not change the position the Department took in respect of this complaint which was made to the Ombudsman.  I anticipate that the correspondence which was entered into with the Ombudsman by Mr. Moran and his Department will attest to their position and I imagine the statement today will reflect the position so there will be no change.  From my perspective, there is a view that Mr. Moran and his officials are giving a view on a report in which they had no active part in terms of the timeframe around when the complaint was made.  For example, if the report was drafted in November 2008, it could be argued that Mr. Moran and the officials appearing before the committee today had no direct impact or no direct involvement in the designation or design of the scheme when it was implemented.  For us to get down to the nuts and bolts of the culture that existed within the Department at the time, it would be important for us to hear the views of those officials who were actively involved in designing the scheme.  We are now getting a contemporaneous view from Mr. Moran and his colleagues.  I have no problem with that but it should be extended so as to reflect the views of the officials who were at the coalface when the scheme was being designed.  Anything short of that will leave this committee devoid of full and frank assessment in terms of being able to hear all the witness and all the parties who were involved in this vital issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_23">On a point of order, will Mr. Moran deal now with the points we have raised?</p>]
[<p eid="para_114">I just heard Mr. Moran say that one designs a scheme from first principles and then one advertises it.  My question relates to the scheme and the manner in which it came about.  I am conscious of the fact that Mr. Moran is speaking in 2010 about a scheme which arguably he had no involvement in designing in the first instance.  I am therefore asking questions about something that he may or may not be able to answer.  I hope that he has a view, however, given that he is the voice of the Department in this context.  On the scheme itself, is it fair to say that there were strident attempts by officials to prevent the scheme coming into existence in the first place?</p>]
[<p eid="para_117">In terms of the design of the scheme and when it came into existence, the Byrne family make their complaint and the Ombudsman concludes.  The Ombudsman's report, on conclusions and recommendations, states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_118">In other words, my investigation considered not just the question of whether the Byrne family met the conditions of the Scheme, but also whether the design of the Scheme and the publication arrangements were factors in their not qualifying under the Scheme in the first place.</p>, <p eid="para_119">She speaks directly to the fact that they may not have met some of the conditions of the scheme, but the design of the scheme, once it came into fruition, is flawed.</p>, <p eid="para_120">Mr. Moran, in his correspondence, stated that the way in which the scheme was advertised was such that a fisherman reading the fishing press was akin to a farmer reading the <i>Irish Farmers’ Journal</i>.  That is Mr. Moran’s view in a contemporary sense, but did he not consider that the Byrne family may not have had the heart to look at the fishing press in the intervening period from when the tragedy happened and that it is quite likely that they would not have had notice by virtue of the fact that they would not have read the fishing press.  Mr. Moran cannot make the assumption with 100% certainty that if they were interested in fishing or if they had an active part in fishing, they would have read the fishing press.  He cannot make that assumption and no Department official, past or present, can make that assumption.  Therefore, the Ombudsman, in respect of her view on the advertising component of the scheme, is vindicated in her position, notwithstanding the fact that she acknowledges that they did not meet at least two of the criteria.</p>]
[<p eid="para_124">What I conclude from that is that there is the balance of two opinions, from an objective point of view, whether one takes the Ombudsman's point of view that the scheme was inadequately advertised or whether one takes the view, because, as the Secretary General is promulgating here, that there is a close-knit fishing community with a specialised press, that there is a clear assumption that everybody will read that and be made aware of the terms of a scheme when it is so advertised.</p>, <p eid="para_125">What we are concerned with here is the fact that the Ombudsman has a special position in relation to the queries and complaints that the average citizen makes.  Whether we take the balance of the view of the Ombudsman or whether we take the balance of the view of the Secretary General, who, arguably, had no act or part in the designation or design of this scheme in the first instance is a matter of conjecture.  However, I speak to the conclusions the Ombudsman made, in point 3 in her report.  It states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_126">Given that this was a finite, once-off Scheme, aimed at a specific class of individuals the Scheme was not advertised adequately.</p>, <p eid="para_127">If we take the weight that is the Ombudsman's office, do we then take in good faith her conclusions in this respect if she further states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_128">The advertising process should have been more thorough, comprehensive and targeted.  In addition some prospective applicants were put in a more advantageous position than others as they were written to directly by the Department and the Minister to inform them about the Scheme when it was launched.  Overall, the manner in which the Scheme was advertised was contrary to fair and sound administration.</p>, <p eid="para_129">Those are her conclusions.  It is deemed, arguably, that she has no vested interest.  As somebody who has no vested interest who is looking at this objectively, do we, if we are not to undermine her office, take this in good faith?  I suggest that we do.  However, if somebody, who was, as she states, a prospective applicant, "were put in a more advantageous position than others as they were written to directly by the Department", did that not put the complainants at a disadvantage?  Did it put some persons to whom the Department wrote in a more advantageous position in respect of this scheme, thereby undermining the level of fairness attaching to the scheme?  Is it the case that, as the Ombudsman states, the manner in which the scheme was advertised was contrary to fair and sound administration?</p>]
[<p eid="para_132">Will the Chairman indicate how much time is left to me?</p>]
[<p eid="para_134">In deference to colleagues, I will leave it at that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_153">The Ombudsman stated to the committee that the Department had accepted a late application dated 11 April 2003 under the scheme.  She obtained the background papers and stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_154">It appears that the application was accepted by the Department on the grounds that the complainant said he had been in contact by telephone with the Department on a number of occasions before the closing date but was given incorrect information, which made him decide at the time that there was no point in submitting an application.  The Department decided that it would be unfair not to accept his application.  I understand that the application was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>, <p eid="para_155">There is a double standard in this regard.</p>]
