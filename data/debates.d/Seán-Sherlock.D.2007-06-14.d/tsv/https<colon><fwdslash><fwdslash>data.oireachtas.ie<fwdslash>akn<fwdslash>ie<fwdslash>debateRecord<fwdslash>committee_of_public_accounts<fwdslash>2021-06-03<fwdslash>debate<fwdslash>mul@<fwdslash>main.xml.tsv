SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-06-03T10:00:00+01:00	On the inspection regime in respect of HAP and RAS, I have a parliamentary question from Deputy Ó Ríordáin. I will speak specifically about the local authorities of Cork County Council and Cork City Council. It shows that the number of inspections carried out to September 2020 in County Cork was 611 and in the city of Cork was 434. Notwithstanding the public health restrictions, we can take out all of the last 12 months in terms of the inspection regime. Is the Secretary General satisfied that the inspection regime is properly funded - we all speak from our own experiences as public representatives – such that it can be ensured that the policy and legislation are working effectively and we do not have families living in absolute slums? That is how I would describe some of the properties I have seen that are beneficiaries of RAS or HAP payments. I contend that the inspection regime is not fit for purpose. I do not want to put the blame on the local authorities. What is the link between the Department and the local authorities in respect of ensuring the inspectorate passes muster and is fit for purpose? I put the question to the Secretary General.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-06-03T10:00:00+01:00	I am conscious of my time. The point I make here is that the witnesses acknowledge that there is an issue with inspections. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a bearing in terms of the number of inspections. I ask that this is prioritised, so that the Department would liaise with the local authorities in order to ensure that the inspection regime is fit for purpose, robust, and properly resourced, and so that there is a significant increase in the number of whole-time equivalents, WTEs, that would be tasked with this.That is the only ask I have. I do not think it is fair to ask a tenant to walk around with a mobile phone to look at his or her house. We have to get people back into houses as quickly as possible. This is about taxpayers’ money at the end of the day. If we are talking about taxpayers’ money, we cannot have a situation where we have quite literally slum landlords. This is the outworking and the resourcing of the policy. Families with children with respiratory illnesses are coming to me because they are not in proper, fit-for-purpose accommodation. That is a poor day for Ireland in terms of how we deal with families under those schemes.
