SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Seán Sherlock)	None	It is the policy of my Department that professional development support services for teachers provide a service through Irish for teachers working in Irish-medium schools.  The PDST has ten full time members of staff who have the capacity to provide a service through the medium of Irish and this is being reviewed in the context of planning for the next school year.  Recruitment processes take account of the skills and capacity requirements of the service and relevant statutory requirements.In addition to the supports provided by the PDST, there are a number of other supports for teachers in Irish-speaking schools.  At post-primary level, An tSeirbhís Tacaíochta Dara Leibhéal don Ghaeilge is a full-time team dedicated to providing support to teachers of Irish in all post-primary schools.  Other supports include summer courses and online resources.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I ask him to identify specific areas, schools or service which engaged with the PDST and where a deficit was found.  I would like to hear more about that.  Perhaps the Department could engage with him.  The PDST can also augment its support mechanisms through the engagement of advisers.  It has the facility to recruit part-time advisers.  I am willing to engage with the Deputy on a specific issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	If the Deputy is aware of specific people who have identified a range of issues, the Department will have to engage with such people.  It is vital.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	In 2005, my Department allocated funding of €300 million for a public private partnership programme comprising 23 new post-primary and four new primary schools.  The provision of the proposed new secondary school in Skibbereen was included in that announcement.  As a site for the school was secured in 2009, it had not been possible to include this project in any of the bundles already being procured.  As part of the jobs initiative recently announced by the Minister, I confirmed that I am developing two further bundles of PPP schools.  The provision of the school in Skibbereen will be considered in this context.The issues to be considered in the timing and bundling of schools include, site availability for each school, geographical spread and total cost of the proposed school bundle.  The timescale for the provision of the school is approximately four years from the time the bundle is announced.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I take on board everything Deputy Harrington has said.  It is vital to proceed with and expedite this project as soon as possible.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 50 together.The Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the registration of teachers including the recognition of teaching qualifications.  Neither I nor my Department have a role in this process.Currently, there is a large range of engineering courses which are recognised for the teaching of Mathematics and/or Applied Mathematics.  These are listed on the Teaching Council's website.  I am advised by the Teaching Council that eligibility for registration depends on the amount of Mathematics or Applied Mathematics covered in the undergraduate degree course.The Teaching Council has engaged with the professional body for engineers, Engineers Ireland, on this matter with a view to identifying further study options through which persons with engineering degrees not recognised above can make up for shortfalls in mathematical content in their qualifications. Options identified include a Higher Diploma in Mathematics/Mathematical Studies available in a number of Irish Universities or one or more modules in Mathematics available from the Open University.  Engineering graduates interested in following one of these routes should check with the Teaching Council beforehand to ensure that the proposed qualification would make up for any mathematical shortfalls in their engineering degree.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 128 together.The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs plays a key role in advising on the future skills needs of enterprise.  Its reports are disseminated directly to third level institutions and provide a valuable input to the development and amendment of course curricula.  EGFSN research and engagement between higher education providers and industry also informed the development and selection of the part-time higher education programmes being funded through Springboard.  Under this new initiative 6,000 places are being provided for unemployed people in areas where employment opportunities are expected to arise in the future, ranging from the food industry to ICT to green technology and international services.  My Department and the HEA, in collaboration with the Secretariat to the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, are also working closely with the ICT industry to develop further responses to specific skills needs that have been identified by that sector.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	My attention had not been drawn to the specific comments of the UK company MD to which the deputy refers. However, I am aware that the Irish equivalent company point out that cloud data is not in any different position than any other kind of data in terms of its exposure to government access, whether by the US or many other countries.A recent report by ENISA, the EU body responsible for information security concluded that holding data in the cloud could represent both a risk and a protection in that the concentrations of data may be an attractive target but the economies of scale can allow defences to be more robust. The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has pointed out that robust EU and national data protection laws must be complied with and that the legislation is technology neutral and must be complied with equally when data is moved to the cloud.Ireland is extremely well-placed to take advantage of the rapidly-growing international potential of cloud computing. A recent report commissioned by Microsoft has estimated that by 2014 the cloud computing industry in Ireland could be worth €9.5 billion and employ 8,600 people. Now more than ever we must do everything we can to seize opportunities like this. I do not believe that these jobs will be created automatically, and Government must act decisively and urgently if we are to position Ireland as a world leader in this high-growth sector. In May I announced the establishment of a €5 million applied research centre in cloud computing, which will bring industry and researchers in this sector together in order to turn good ideas into good jobs.  I have also established a cross-Government implementation group on cloud computing, to support the implementation of the ambitious programme for Government commitment on cloud computing.
