[<p eid="para_18">Young people have been the group most seriously affected by the collapse of employment following Ireland’s economic crash. However, youth employment has stabilised in the past year and appears set to start growing as the economic recovery continues. Recent labour market figures published by the CSO indicate that the number of young people under 25 years of age in employment increased by 3,200 in the year to quarter three 2013. The number of young people who are unemployed fell by 13,600 in the past 12 months.</p>, <p eid="para_19"> The Government is working to tackle the issue of youth opportunities in the labour market through the combined efforts of the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work strategies. The Action Plan for Jobs has sought to bring about a transition in the jobs and enterprise sectors to develop new job opportunities in sustainable sectors and to create 100,000 jobs by 2016. This work will continue vigorously in the coming years. However, it is encouraging to see record growth of jobs in our exporting sectors and signs of progress across a range of sectors. It will be vital to sustain this growth in employment in order to deliver job opportunities to young entrants.</p>, <p eid="para_20"> Through Pathways to Work, the Government has brought in a range of new initiatives to support young people looking for employment such as JobsPlus, JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum, and the ICT action plan, which are delivered by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills. The Government is taking steps to increase the numbers of places and make other enhancements to those schemes where possible. For example, JobBridge has increased from 5,000 places initially to 8,500 places being currently available. The JobsPlus initiative, which is currently available to those who are unemployed for 12 months or more, is being extended from 1 January next to those under the age of 26 who have been unemployed for six months or more.</p>, <p eid="para_21"> My Department, together with Enterprise Ireland, is also examining options for CEB-led initiatives aimed at promoting youth entrepreneurship, including a mix of financial supports for business start-ups, feasibility studies and mentoring. It is also working with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Education and Skills to develop the Youth Guarantee, in line with the agreement reached under the Irish Presidency earlier this year.</p>]
[<p eid="para_23">The youth guarantee was negotiated under the Irish Presidency. A sum of €3 billion will be provided by the European Social Fund and a new budget line of €3 billion will also be provided. We will submit our plan to the EU by the end of 2013. An interdepartmental group has been set up in this regard comprising the Departments of Social Protection, Education and Skills, Public Expenditure and Reform, Children and Youth Affairs, Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Taoiseach and our Department, and they are all working on the plan.</p>, <p eid="para_24"> It is important, though, to acknowledge 1,600 jobs a week were being lost in the three years before we took office but now the economy is creating 1,200 jobs per week. Those jobs are being taken up by young people as well. There has been a positive change in employment over the past 12 months.</p>]
[<p eid="para_26">A total of 19,500 young people have left the live register to take up work in the past 12 months. We have had four consecutive quarters of job creation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">JobBridge is not the panacea for the teaching profession, but the evidence is that we are creating more teaching jobs through the Department of Education and Skills by virtue of demographic changes with an increase in the birth rate, and the Deputy will acknowledge that many projects are under way to reflect that in our own county of Cork. JobBridge is a labour activation measure, which is having a positive effect on getting people into work. Approximately 500 job matches have been taken up as a result of the JobsPlus scheme. MOMENTUM comprises a €20 million package offering 6,500 training places through 36 education providers in 87 locations. We are conducting a review of apprenticeships because if one looks at where jobs were lost, young people were last in, first out. We need to examine, in particular, how we can upskill those who lost jobs in the construction industry, and that is why have introduced Springboard, the start your own business initiative, and the home renovation scheme, which will have a positive knock-on effect in getting young people back into the workplace. There is a vigorous and robust response to this issue, but I take the Deputy's point about the youth guarantee. The plan is being formulated and we can discuss that when it comes to fruition.</p>]
[<p eid="para_41">Deputy Ross is revising it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">I am informed by IDA Ireland that the agency does not have any units or warehouses, which are vacant in County Kerry. Enterprise Ireland does not have a property portfolio as IDA Ireland provides property solutions to Enterprise Ireland clients when required. The responsibility for local authority properties lies with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>, <p eid="para_61"> The property to which the Deputy refers is not in the ownership of IDA Ireland. I understand from IDA Ireland that the premises itself was formerly a manufacturing facility and the options for the building in its current format are limited. I am informed that Killarney Town Council is assessing what options may be available for the building, including converting it into an enterprise centre. Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have assured me that they are available to provide any assistance that may be required. </p>, <p eid="para_62"> IDA Ireland owns approximately ten acres of land at the IDA business and technology park, Killarney, which is available for marketing to both overseas and indigenous industry. In addition, the agency has approximately two acres of land at the IDA estate in Killorglin and 1.41 acres in Annascaul, which is also available for marketing.</p>, <p eid="para_63"> Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and client companies employ in excess of 4,900 people across County Kerry, while Kerry county enterprise board has processed 37 projects during 2013 which have the capacity to generate 116 full-time and 53 part-time jobs by 2015. Enterprise Ireland activity in Kerry is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new high potential start-up companies. There are 132 Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county, employing 3,318 people.</p>, <p eid="para_64">
<i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
</p>, <p eid="para_65">There are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of approximately 1,600<b>
</b>people.<i>
</i>IDA Ireland engages with these companies on an ongoing basis and the key areas of focus are to encourage operational sustainability, job retention and, in certain cases, expansion. IDA Ireland also endorses and supports the initiatives driven under the Succeed in Ireland agenda which also engages key stakeholders in the regions regarding opportunities for investment. Additionally, the existing base of overseas companies located in Kerry brings spin off benefits right across the south-west region through direct and indirect employment, for example, indigenous suppliers, logistics, security, catering companies, etc. The Action Plan for Jobs can benefit enterprises in Kerry. For example, the county would particularly benefit from initiatives that have been targeted at supporting the tourism and agrifood sectors.</p>, <p eid="para_66"> Many of the initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs will also be very relevant to enterprise in Kerry. These include the introduction of new financing models for SMEs, such as the microfinance fund for start-ups and the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme; the development of an integrated first stop shop for small enterprises through local enterprise offices; new schemes to help small businesses recruit via JobBridge, Springboard and MOMENTUM and the introduction of the JobsPlus scheme that provides an employment subsidy of over €70 per week to employers who recruit a person who has been unemployed for 12 months; the appointment of business development managers to 37 community enterprise centres across the country as part of a €2 million programme aimed at protecting and growing businesses in the community; and expanded support from Enterprise Ireland for start-ups, first time exporters and the establishment of a first time exporters division.</p>]
[<p eid="para_68">The Deputy mentioned County Cork. From the intercounty perspective, there are strong pharmaceutical and ICT sectors in Cork. The Deputy said IDA Ireland had created 163 jobs in 2011 in Kerry. However, it is not IDA Ireland but the companies that come in and conduct site visits which make the final decision as to where they will locate their business. Perhaps we could explore further the dynamic that exists in regard to the number of prospective companies or creators of employment, the number of site visits that take place and the analysis of the visits in terms of the decisions they make as to where to locate their business.</p>]
[<p eid="para_70">The Deputy mentioned the tourism sector and there has been significant investment by State agencies, such as Fáilte Ireland, to ensure the tourism package in County Kerry is maintained. This supports and creates jobs. The recent decision by the Government to retain the VAT rate for the sector has had a significant impact in terms of job creation and the maintenance of the sector in the Kerry region.</p>, <p eid="para_71"> The story is not all bleak in County Kerry. The IT in Tralee has a major competence centre and there has been serious investment in companies like Dairymaster, which is seen as an exemplar for the agrifood and business sector. Also, through the centre for intelligent mechatronics and sensors at the Institute of Technology Tralee, ITT, and through the Kerry technology park, there is a strong emphasis and mood towards supporting high potential start-ups and towards ensuring we can concentrate on areas where Kerry has strong sectoral comparative advantages, particularly in the dairy or machinery sector. We will continue those investments. Enterprise Ireland, through the Department, is investing in the competence centre in ITT and that will create jobs in the long term.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">Crowdfunding, in respect of enterprise and other activities, is becoming an ever more popular alternative mechanism for businesses and promoters across the globe to access finance in a difficult financial market. In its various forms, crowdfunding allows individuals, businesses and promoters to solicit capital from funders, using social networks and crowdfunding platforms to finance projects. It appears to be affording real opportunities in the area of alternative finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. Use of the mechanism appears to have seen substantial growth globally in the recent past, and it is seen by many sponsors as a means of democratising access to funds and supply of capital while moving the model away from venture capitalists and angel investors.</p>, <p eid="para_75"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has met a crowdfunding company, Linked Finance, to explore the potential for this new source of funding in an Irish context. In addition, as part of a process of exploring new approaches for improving access to finance, departmental officials have engaged at EU level and the small business advisory group has considered crowdfunding and alternative access to finance models.</p>, <p eid="para_76"> Crowdfunding is in its infancy and financial returns on capital will dictate its overall success. Data are not readily available domestically, at EU level or internationally with which to analyse its impact to date, although moves are afoot at EU level to consider methods to address this data deficiency. The issues of consumer protection and regulation also exercise many countries operating in this space. Decisions are only beginning to be taken in respect of these key elements of this novel way of funding enterprises. The Government, through the State bodies group chaired by the Department of Finance, is keeping the issue under review as to how best to utilise crowdfunding benefits to promote business development.</p>, <p eid="para_77">

</p>, <p eid="para_78"> In terms of supporting access to various forms of financing, substantial funding has been provided by the Government and my Department is actively engaged in various initiatives. For example, my Department provides funding for the HALO business angel partnership, HBAP, through Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland. This partnership provides investment for start-ups and has recently broken a €55 million total investment milestone in 128 deals since the organisation was founded six years ago. In total, €23 million has been invested by angel investors brought to the table by the national HBAP organisation over the past six years. The balance of €32.5 million was committed by seed funds, Enterprise Ireland and other private investors. HALO also works to develop business angel syndicates. Up to 60% of all angel funding in Ireland is coming through individuals, with syndicate groups making up a healthy 40%.</p>, <p eid="para_79"> My Department has also funded the seed and venture capital scheme 2013-2017 through Enterprise Ireland, which will make commitments totalling €175 million to business during the operation of the scheme. This commitment is expected to leverage a further €525 million in private sector funding. Considerable effort has been put into addressing the seed and early stage funding gap indirectly through commitments to venture capital funds and directly through Enterprise Ireland's investment in the early stage competitive start fund and high potential start-up companies in 2012. Further Government supports include the seed capital scheme, SCS, and the employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, which are tax relief incentives for businesses provided by the Revenue Commissioners.</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">I take the Deputy’s point. Linked Finance has made presentations to the State bodies group. We are aware of the possibilities of this potential source of funding. We are also aware of the UK initiative through Funding Circle and its £20 million pot. As it is a lending and investment model, we need to examine the tax implications, returns on investment and regulation. We have the seed and venture capital scheme, the HALO business angel partnership. These are other sources of funding which the State provides through its agencies. We are tracking this issue and will be proactive on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_83">I note the Deputy’s point. Linked Finance has made a presentation to the State bodies group. It is a live issue as a way of providing new forms of financing for enterprises and start-up companies. It is necessary to examine the regulatory and taxation regime as well as the permutations for the people taking the punt, as Deputy Calleary said, to ensure it is robust and they will not be caught out by this. An exemption on profits is also being examined.</p>]
