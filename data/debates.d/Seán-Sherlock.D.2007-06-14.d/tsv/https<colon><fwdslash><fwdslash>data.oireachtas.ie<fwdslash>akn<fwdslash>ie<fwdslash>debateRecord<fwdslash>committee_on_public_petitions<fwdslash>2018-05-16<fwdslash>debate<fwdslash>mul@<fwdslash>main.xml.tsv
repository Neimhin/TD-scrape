SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-05-16T13:30:00+01:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Martin Haydon whom I wish well. His wife has given birth. I do not know whether it was a boy or a child, as we say down my way.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2018-05-16T13:30:00+01:00	We pass on our congratulations to the Deputy and his wife and family on their good news.  I ask members to, please, turn off their mobile phones. The usual provisos apply. Will they, please, switch them to airplane mode?  In accordance with the standard procedures agreed to by the Committee on Procedure for paperless committees, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated to members on the document database.  I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
