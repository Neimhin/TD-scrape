[<p eid="para_83">I will start with the helpline, as we are on that theme and to follow-on from Deputy Mitchell. There seems to be, if I am interpreting it correctly, common ground emerging between Scouting Ireland and Tusla in respect of the helpline. Will Mr. Gibson help me to understand what the independent review will mean in real terms? If they go to an academic institution, what will it be tasked with doing? Will it examine every case and does it have the statutory authority to be able to examine every case? Is it a logging and documenting exercise? What is the nature of the independent review? If there are clear statutory obligations in respect of the historical cases - I make the distinction between the historical and contemporary - I still do not understand from what Mr. Gibson stated how that process will be managed. If Mr. Gibson can enlighten me on that in the first instance, I would be grateful.</p>]
[<p eid="para_87">On that, Scouting Ireland will tell us that it has a team of professional staff who have listened and engaged and it would have notified Tusla to that effect. Personally, as one member of the committee, I take in good faith that a process is under way in respect of the historical cases, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Elliott, who has a strong track record on this, is also involved in that process and has good form in respect of Cloyne and other issues. I take that in good faith and I am satisfied with that.</p>, <p eid="para_88"> I refer to the 18 February letter from Tusla to Scouting Ireland. The explosive line in that letter relates to the overnights. Did Tusla have any sense of the hurt and shock that it would cause when that letter went into the public domain in respect of the thousands of volunteers and parents who have gone through Garda vetting and child protection training and would see themselves as being protective and compliant in every way?</p>, <p eid="para_89">Did Tusla have any sense of the sheer hurt and the magnitude of that statement, as well as of the potential effect of closing down an organisation in one fell swoop? One of the main <i>modus operandi</i> of scouting is that children experience overnight camping. The letter was devastating to the thousands of innocent and decent people who give hours of their time to Scouting Ireland, who are dedicated to this lifestyle, and do so for the common good and the purpose of bringing benefit to society. Does Tusla feel any regret for including that in its letter of 18 February?</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">With respect, the letter came into the public domain via the Minister herself on foot of a Topical Issue matter which Deputy Rabbitte and I put down. I will not go into the modalities of that now. The fact is that the letter is in the public domain and was put there by the Minister herself.</p>, <p eid="para_92"> Notwithstanding the child safeguarding statement and the Safety First legislation, Tusla is stating there is a job of work to be done in respect of compliance with the safety statement. That is the role of the professional staff in Scouting Ireland. I want to make a distinction between the role of the professional staff regarding their obligations. It is mapped on to the letter Tusla sent. In three – certainly two - of the cases, a professional person in Scouting Ireland made an intervention that could be deemed to be inappropriate in respect of whether it was compliant with the child safeguarding statement. We need to make the distinction between that and those episodes. One could argue that when those incidents occurred, that the volunteers who were on the ground came in straight away and notified the relevant person in charge of safeguarding. It was thereafter that there might have been a failure of process.</p>, <p eid="para_93"> It is important to make the distinction that the volunteers on the ground, who go through the child protection training and receive their instructions from the professional staff as to their obligations, are without blemish in this instance.</p>, <p eid="para_94"> I want an understanding of that dynamic from Tusla. If it acknowledges this distinction today, that will go some way towards assuaging the thousands of people who perceive that Tusla came down heavily on volunteers. One has to accept there is always risk but, in the main, the bulk of volunteers across the country are compliant and <i>au fait</i> with their obligations as parents and volunteers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">It is not subtle. It is obvious.</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">The bottom line is that, as a layperson, I interpreted the letter from 18 February as stating there were to be certain actions to be carried out by the person in charge of safeguarding within the organisation. It is clear from the letter that certain matters were not dealt with. Again, that is at the professional staff level. I reiterate there is a difference between that level of engagement and a parent's or a volunteer's level of engagement on the ground on a typical weekend. As a parent, I would have no hesitation in sending a child off to a camp with Scouting Ireland. I am happy and satisfied that the volunteers are compliant with their obligations.</p>, <p eid="para_100"> The committee needs to be satisfied that the process under way with Scouting Ireland is actually addressing the issues of the letter of 18 February, that there is a cascade effect regarding Children First and that Tusla is satisfied that a process is under way which will give confidence to everybody, particularly those outside of Scouting Ireland who are not necessarily <i>au fait</i> with policies, procedures, practices or the culture which exists within the scouting family. It is the public which needs to have confidence on this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_102">When is Tusla meeting Scouting Ireland next?</p>]
[<p eid="para_216">I am sorry to interrupt but I must ask Mr. Gibson to repeat what he has just said as I could not hear him.</p>]
[<p eid="para_222">Chairman-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_224">I am helping the Chairman. It is on his point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_226">The Chairman has raised a pertinent issue. To follow on from what he said about Scouting Ireland's update on its action plan, it acknowledged issues related to structural policy monitoring and what else?</p>]
[<p eid="para_228">Scouting Ireland is acknowledging they are on hold. I deduce from that that they are being actively worked on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_269">On point 4 of that, relating to historical cases and the agreed action plan, if there is some articulation back to us about how the historical cases are being dealt with, that would be very helpful. My last question relates to the interaction between Tusla and the Department. Tusla issued a letter on 18 February which clearly outlined specific issues about the adherence to Children First, the legislation, and so on. On 21 February, the Minister announced through <i>The Irish Times </i>that State funding for child protection improvements would be increased and that €220,000 was received by Scouting Ireland. I am trying to reconcile the concerns of Tusla as of 18 February, addressed in the witnesses' letter, and the vote of confidence of the Minister about safeguarding procedures. It seems to be incongruous that the Minister or her spokesperson said it was on the right path. Was there a line of communication between Tusla and the Minister's Department, officials or office about concerns that Tusla had on safeguarding issues?</p>]
[<p eid="para_271">Had Deputy Rabbitte and I not raised this as a Topical Issue matter and if Mr. Elliott had not put the correspondence from Tusla in front of the Minister, which she then put on the public record, we would not be sitting here today.</p>]
[<p eid="para_273">The Minister would have been none the wiser and would have continued in good faith to restore the funding and make funding available.</p>]
[<p eid="para_276">Specific funding, some €220,000, was made available for safeguarding and that is the question here. We are trying to understand this. I speak as a former Minister. Protocols relating to letters of this nature, that relate to a public issue which affects thousands of people, are a key component of Tusla's statutory work. Tusla is a statutory agency with the power of legislation behind it. We have to acknowledge that one would have thought there would be a clear line of communication to the Minister's officials, if not directly to the Minister's office, for a response to the granting of an extra €220,000 for safeguarding, which was reported on 21 February, when clear concerns were raised by Tusla on 18 February.</p>]
[<p eid="para_353">Is it Mr. Elliott?</p>]
[<p eid="para_435">There is much to try to internalise and understand from the contributions. My earlier intervention was based on the idea that there needs to be progress while we are all moving forward, which means the State agencies, the statutory bodies, Scouting Ireland, as a voluntary organisation, and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are all on a journey to ensure that an organisation that is cherished within Irish society emerges stronger as a result of what has happened. While we are on that journey, there remain questions to be teased out. If we have concerns, no matter how seemingly ill founded they might be, they are nonetheless concerns. It is important that we reserve the right to ask questions, and so doing should not be taken as having a particular view on an organisation or individuals within it.</p>, <p eid="para_436"> As Deputy Rabbitte noted, she and I raised the Topical Issue matter but if we had not, we would arguably not be having this discussion. The motive for raising the matter was predicated on the concerns we had that information was entering the public domain via <i>The Irish Times</i> and we read the information but there was no mechanism where the Minister would report to us in the committee or to the Oireachtas in respect of the process. We merely wanted to establish the facts of the process for the historical cases. I understand the point Mr. Elliott made about historical cases but given that the numbers were in the public domain, we felt that it was necessary to interrogate the process. It was at that juncture that the Minister put the Tusla letter on the record of the House.</p>, <p eid="para_437"> That leads me to my first question. The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has stated on the record that the letter of 18 February was not copied or issued to any person outside of Scouting Ireland or Tusla. On Wednesday, 27 February 2019, Tusla received a request from the Department to provide a copy of the letter dated 18 February 2019. The Department had received direct communication from Scouting Ireland's interim safeguarding manager, Mr. Ian Elliott, on Tuesday, 26 February 2019 in connection with Tusla's letter. That letter was provided to the Department, and the Minister read its recommendations into the Dáil record and later published the letter on the Department's website. Will Mr. Elliott confirm his version of events <i>vis-à-vis</i> Tusla's interpretation of events? The letter exists - that is a statement of fact - and it was sent to Tusla. How did the letter then return to the Department? Did Mr. Elliot furnish that letter to the Department?</p>]
[<p eid="para_439">By whom?</p>]
[<p eid="para_441">From the Department.</p>]
[<p eid="para_443">Mr. Elliott did not send a copy of the letter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_445">It is important to make the distinction that Scouting Ireland emailed the Department-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_447">-----but the letter was sought by the Department and Scouting Ireland did not furnish it with same.</p>]
[<p eid="para_449">Did the two officials which Mr. Elliott named say why they wanted the letter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_451">The email was sent on 26 February, which coincides with the raising of the Topical Issue matter in the Dáil.</p>]
[<p eid="para_454">I am conscious of time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_456">Mr. Elliott has proof through the correspondence, a log of the call and so on that it was the departmental officials who contacted Scouting Ireland. They wanted a copy of the letter. Did they say why?</p>]
[<p eid="para_458">How did they know that the letter existed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_460">Without furnishing them with the letter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_462">A question mark now hangs over this process. We may need to contact the Department and the Minister about this issue, given that she has now arguably been put into this process. She stood before the Dáil and said clearly that she was in receipt of the letter. I do not have the transcript before me, but she certainly said that she had received the letter. Tusla says that it-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_464">She had received the letter only a matter of hours before. I will park that for the time being, as it is pertinent to the issue and there is now a question mark over the nature of the Minister or her Department's involvement in this process.</p>, <p eid="para_465"> The interagency meeting was held on 25 February.</p>]
[<p eid="para_467">What transpired at that meeting?</p>]
[<p eid="para_469">Regarding the timeline, 18 February was the date of the letter and 25 February was the date of the interagency meeting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_471">Was the 18 February letter discussed at that 25 February meeting? Mr. Elliott did not receive it until 22 February, but the letter was dated 18 February.</p>]
[<p eid="para_473">Were the issues contained in the letter addressed at the interagency meeting on 25 February?</p>]
[<p eid="para_475">Mr. Elliott felt that, in line with his obligations <i>vis-à-vis </i>his interaction with Tusla and given the confidentiality of these matters, there should have been a clear-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_477">The Minister came into the House on 27 February, put the letter of 18 February into the public domain and the bombshell was dropped in respect of the weekends and overnights, but that issue had been addressed prior to 27 February in the interagency meeting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_479">What was the nature of the discussions with the Garda?</p>]
[<p eid="para_481">Mr. Elliott got that assurance from the Garda.</p>]
[<p eid="para_483">Will Mr. Elliot explain that? No case record has been examined.</p>]
[<p eid="para_485">No staff member has been interviewed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_487">This has opened up a whole new can of worms. Tusla appeared before us earlier and gave a version of events, and we now have Scouting Ireland's interpretation of events. It throws up a set of new questions.</p>, <p eid="para_488"> I wish to discuss the letter of 18 February again. Arising from the evidence we have just heard, there are questions to be asked of the departmental officials and the Minister in respect of this matter. Regarding the helpline, I will ask Mr. Elliott to put himself in the politician's position for a second. The Minister appeared before the House and put the key points of the Tusla letter on the record. When an Oireachtas Member hears the words, "Scouting Ireland should consider the viability of continuing with overnight trips", the natural and immediate reaction is to wonder whether something explosive that we did not know about had happened and to take the Minister in good faith. Having parsed this situation out a little further and consulted people on the ground regarding their obligations in respect of safeguarding, and given that overnight camps took place at the weekend, there is public confidence in matters at ground level.</p>, <p eid="para_489"> Notwithstanding all of that, legitimate issues were raised in the letter of 18 February regarding the three cases at hand. They should not be glossed over, and I am not saying anyone has. It is not that the incidents did not take place. There was arguably a response at the time by the designated liaison officers. One could safely conclude that. If there was not, the cases would not have been highlighted in the way they have been.</p>, <p eid="para_490">I am not happy at the manner in which professional staff responded. For me, the issue is the manner in which Scouting Ireland responds to matters. I make no apology in that regard. In two of the cases Tusla highlights that the intervention and interrogation of children were inappropriate. That is where the failing was. We all appreciate and understand risk is inherent in any voluntary organisation, but in this instance the manner in which the eight professional staff responded was inappropriate. That is the issue for Tusla. It was mentioned that it had been raised at the inter-agency meeting on 25 February. What was the response of Tusla to Scouting Ireland in raising it, or did it raise in the manner I have just articulated it?</p>]
[<p eid="para_492">In the three cases.</p>]
[<p eid="para_494">We have the sample cases to go on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_497">I would like to ask one more question because new information has come to light that is explosive.</p>]
[<p eid="para_499">I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue again. What is so injurious in the letter from Tusla in respect of the helpline that Scouting Ireland is seeking to refute it? The letter states further concerns arise about the management of a recent situation and that confidential information was shared with a Children First information and advice officer, CFIAO, etc. My impression from earlier interventions by Mr. Elliott is that it is injurious to Scouting Ireland.</p>]
[<p eid="para_501">We are all trying to understand the issue. I am not a child protection expert, but Mr. Elliott is saying that, in respect of case A and case B, Tusla's interpretation of the course of events is incorrect? In other words, there are question marks over Tusla's interpretation of events in regard to the interventions made by eight professional safeguarding officers for Scouting Ireland.</p>]
[<p eid="para_503">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_509">Mr. Tennant read his interpretation of the barrister's report, about which I have a number of questions, but we do not have time to deal with them today. We need a further iteration in that regard.</p>]
