SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-11-20T15:00:00+00:00	I thank the Cathaoirleach for his invitation to address the House in regard to the recently published report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, entitled Report on the Grocery Goods Sector - Increasing Equity and Transparency in Producer-Processor-Retailer Relationships. The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, cannot be here today to contribute to the debate as he is on an important trade mission to India. He sends his apologies. I welcome the publication of the committee's report, which considers a wide range of issues and makes a series of 13 recommendations which primarily fall for consideration by two Ministers, namely, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. As the report itself notes, it focuses on four key areas. These are the proposed code of conduct in the grocery goods sector, pricing and its impact on primary and secondary suppliers, support for local produce, and labelling. In my contribution I will concentrate on the issue of regulating certain practices in the grocery goods sector, which falls within the remit of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I will also briefly address some of the issues raised in the report relating to policy responsibilities of other Ministers, namely, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Health. The Government is strongly of the view that it is important to ensure there is a balance in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector, with a view to ensuring Ireland continues to have robust agrifood and retail sectors. This is a particular priority given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. Regulation of certain practices in the grocery goods sector is intended to achieve such a balance, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector, including the consumer, and the need to ensure there is no impediment to the passing on of lower prices to consumers. As the joint committee's report notes, the issue of regulating certain practices in the grocery goods sector has been on the table for several years. The central issue has been the question of whether a voluntary code of conduct was required or, on the other hand, whether a statutory response should be pursued. Views differ on this aspect, as the report notes. In May 2011, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, published the Travers report, which addressed the issue of attempts to seek a voluntary code of conduct. The report found that there did not appear to be any likelihood of such a voluntary code being agreed. To this end, a draft statutory code of conduct was prepared as the basis of a public consultation process. The unlikelihood of a voluntary code being agreed was also recognised by the commitment in the programme for Government to regulate - I emphasise the word "regulate" - for certain practices in the grocery goods sector. At the time of the publication of the Travers report, the Minister recognised that regulation of the grocery goods sector was a highly contentious issue and there was an inevitable strain in the relationships between suppliers and retailers. These relationships should be built on solid principles of mutual opportunity and fair competition, which does not always happen. The Minister expressed his disappointment that there had been no agreement on a voluntary code, regulation by Government being always the option of last resort. He added that where regulation is contemplated, it should be forensically designed to avoid unnecessary costs for consumers and businesses and ensure a fair balance between them. As the report of the joint committee shows, these views remain as valid today as in 2011. The committee's report notes developments at EU level on the issue of the relationship between various parts of the food supply chain. In September 2013, a voluntary initiative on principles of good practice in the food supply chain was launched and adopted by certain European associations. However, not all elements of the supply chain signed up to this initiative, mirroring the different views on the value of a voluntary system that emerged in Ireland from the Travers report process. In a parallel exercise, the European Commission published its Green Paper on Unfair Trading Practices in the Business-to-Business Food and Non-Food Supply Chain in Europe earlier this year. The Commission also commenced a public consultation process to gather the views of market participants on the occurrence of these practices, their possible effects and the most effective remedies, if required. That consultation process was guided by a range of questions to respondents, including queries as to whether they considered unfair trading practices to be pervasive and whether there was consumer detriment in the presence of such unfair commercial practices. Given the diversity of respondents involved in the exercise, there was little consensus on any of the range of questions. The Commission is considering the results in order to decide whether it will initiate any proposals in this area. However, none of this precludes any member state from taking measures it considers necessary. Such complementarity between EU work and national work is recognised by the Commission. Obviously, we will all take an interest in the implementation of the voluntary initiative and the impact of its development over the forthcoming months. It will not, however, halt the implementation of the commitment in the programme for Government. To give effect to that commitment, work is at an advanced stage on the drafting of the consumer protection and competition Bill. That legislation will provide for the amalgamation of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, implementation of the recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers, and amendments to both competition and consumer legislation. It will also contain enabling provisions to allow the Minister to regulate certain practices in the grocery goods sector. It is hoped the Bill will be published by the end of the year for debate in the Oireachtas in early 2014. While the exact wording of the legislation is not yet been agreed by the Government, I propose to address several of its proposed provisions that are germane to the issues raised in the joint committee's report. The first point to make is that the Government, in accordance with its programme for Government commitment, will not be legislating for a voluntary code of conduct.Statutory regulation of certain practices will be introduced. Although not finalised, it is likely that these will take the form of a series of regulations, with associated sanctions, rather than a code of conduct. This links in with the main recommendation of the committee. Second, the report calls for the appointment of an independent ombudsman to oversee and enforce the regulations. As the House will appreciate, the establishment of a new stand-alone State body to oversee this issue would, in the current economic climate, not be feasible for reasons of scarce financial resources, duplication with enforcement of existing legislation in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 on activities that prevent, restrict or distort competition in the grocery goods sector, and the need to ensure there is no unnecessary proliferation of public service bodies. Hence, as has already been noted in previous comments on this matter in the Oireachtas, the amalgamated Competition Authority and National Consumer Agency, NCA, will be the independent body assigned the responsibility for overseeing and enforcing these regulations. This new body will be given the powers to enforce the regulations. However, in enforcing any regulations, the basic tenets of fair procedure and natural and constitutional justice must be upheld. It is important to note that the introduction of any regulations does not, and cannot, guarantee anything regarding the prices received by any given link in the supply chain. Negotiations on price will remain an issue between the contracting parties, as happens in any commercial relationship. The intention of the new regulations will be to regulate certain practices, not set prices. On the issue of disclosure of margins by retailers, the contents of the financial statements of companies are governed by relevant EU company law directives and regulations and by the applicable accounting standards. The requirements regarding the preparation and publication of the accounts of limited companies and groups are determined by the first, fourth and seventh EU company law directives and by the EU IFRS regulations. These requirements are largely reflected in the Companies Act 1963, the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 and the European Communities (Companies: Group Accounts) Regulations 1992, as amended. The EU 11th company law directive, implemented as the European Communities (Branch Disclosures) Regulations 1993, addresses the requirements applicable to branches of EEA companies. Irish subsidiaries of EEA companies can submit the audited group accounts of their parent to the Registrar of Companies instead of their own individual accounts, provided certain conditions are met. EEA companies that have an Irish branch are required to submit only the company accounts to the Registrar of Companies. Irish companies that are subsidiaries of EEA companies and which are themselves parent companies need not produce consolidated accounts provided certain conditions are met. There are similar provisions for subsidiaries of non-EEA companies. In such cases the consolidated accounts of the EEA or non-EEA group must be submitted to the Registrar of Companies. There are no plans to amend this disclosure regime in respect of specific sectors in the economy as this would be open to accusations of discrimination and, were it to be required generally in the economy, it could have implications in terms of business costs and attracting foreign direct investment. Most of the other issues such as an all-Ireland market for contracted winter milk and closer relationships between the multiples and local producers are policy matters for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. However, on the first point, I understand that the supply of milk for processing, North or South, is being monitored with the ending of milk quotas in 2015. On the second point, I understand the development agencies have been active in promoting closer links between multiples and local producers. On the issue of minimum prices for alcohol, the House will be aware that the Minister for Health has proposed such a move in his recent initiative on the issue of misuse of alcohol. The Minister for Health also has a role in food labelling. I am sure both Ministers will take note of the points raised today in respect of their areas of responsibility. I look forward to hearing the reactions of the House to the report and its views on its recommendations. I will relay these to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on his return from India to allow
him to consider them in the process of finalising the proposed legislation. Of course, the issue will be debated further when the Bill comes before the Oireachtas for debate in the new year.

SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-11-20T16:20:00+00:00	Milk, chocolate, wine and roses, Pink Lady chocolates - where do I start?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-11-20T16:20:00+00:00	I have to declare an interest. I have tasted Senator Mary White's chocolates and recently took receipt of two wonderful boxes of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's chocolates-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-11-20T16:20:00+00:00	-----and they were fantastic. I will go through the issues very quickly. Regulations will be based on the draft code published by the Minster in 2011. The main issue for competition in the grocery goods sector is entry into the market. In this context, the retail planning guidelines were one of the main issues identified. That is from an earlier contribution. There is a commitment in An Action Plan for Jobs to examine consumer price issues. A report on that will be issued by Forfás in the coming months which will examine the reason price levels are so high in certain areas within the market. The EU measures were a voluntary set of principles, not a code. They were adopted in September 2013. There are many players in the chain who have not signed up to those principles, which are similar to those behind the draft code published by the Minister in 2011. If a retailer or a supplier is not engaged in any prohibitive practice, they will have nothing to fear from the new regulations. The issue of dominance in the market came up in the debate. Dominance in the market is not illegal but an abuse of that dominance is illegal. I listened carefully to Senators Feargal Quinn and Mary Ann O'Brien on the issue of hello money and the subtle practices around trying to get a product placed on the shelves. We all appreciate that there are well established practices one engages in when one tries to get a product onto the shelf, but the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 prohibits hello money being demanded. Natural justice demands, however, that defendants hear from their accusers. I am a former Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and have dealt with the issues of hello money and sharp practices, but we appear to have a culture here where people are unwilling to challenge the type of paradigm that exists regarding pressures put on by certain multiples. If it is happening, somebody should come forward. There is legislation to deal with the issue but until somebody comes forward, what do we do? That is a rhetorical question.That explains the issue of profits in respect of some of the large multiples to which the Senator referred. It is well known that some large retailers are private companies and are not covered by some company law requirements. When I was spokesperson on agriculture, I regularly met the IFA which always states it is a price-taker. The IFA is the most powerful lobby in this country and I have always failed to understand how it is a price-taker. I have told the current and previous presidents of the IFA and others across the spectrum that I do not understand why the most powerful lobby in this country is a price-taker for the purposes of its interaction. I understand what happens inside the farm gate and the relationship with a co-op and we do not know what the dynamic of the market will be after 2015. As a personal opinion, I imagine that price levels will rise on the global market and will then stream off but I imagine there will be arrangements by which milk producers will strike a price with their individual co-ops to achieve stability within the price ranges for a guaranteed period. I am not on top of that matter as we speak but I take the point made about milk. I pay tribute to Deputy Andrew Doyle, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine because the committee's recommendation No. 9, which is very interesting, speaks to an all-Ireland market for contracted winter milk and that should be encouraged. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, should take that on board. As there is legislation pending in this area my officials who are here and I will take on board the points made today, and the issues pertaining to agriculture and the food sector will be conveyed to the Minister. I hope I have interpreted correctly Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's point about the nanny state. I agree with the point. The retail sector is robust and if one has a good product it will make it onto the shelf but there is a subtlety about how that happens and how high up or low down the product will be. There is no sharp practice there. We all understand that but we have to distinguish between that practice, which is inherent to the retail trade, and hello money. I have not even begun to address all of the Senators' points. In the United Kingdom only one adjudicator was appointed. There are no full-time staff, the staff are sent in as required. The estimated cost was €5 million and I understand the point made about that but we propose including the role within the new NCA competition area and there will be a suite of resources available to enforce the role as required. On the issue of enforceability abroad, this applies to all member states that have codes or regulations. This is one of the issues raised in the EU Green Paper which the Commission is considering. It remains to be seen how that will emerge because I understand that it would not be part of the co-decision procedure but will be a function of whether member states take it on board. We have to acknowledge that there are two opposing lobbies within some of the employer and business representative organisations, to which members pay subscriptions. There is no specific recommendation on own brands, but I hail from a town that was once the bastion of the Irish sugar industry and during my college years I worked in Irish Sugar. I recall one day taking off the Irish Sugar label, placing it on the ground and putting on another own-brand label. The price differential was 10p at the time. Two packets of the same product sit beside each other in the same shop. Is that a consumer issue? Is it a marketing issue? Is it a question of the psychology of markets? If I buy a packet of SuperValu tea it is as good as some of the other brands that are synonymous with Cork. Does that come off the same line? I do not know. As a consumer, I am conscious of it, that is the point I am making. Consumers are very intelligent about their choices and we have to allow for that dynamic and not necessarily legislate for it. That is a personal opinion but we will see what the legislation will bring.
