[<p eid="para_251">Will Mr. McLoughlin throw in a few tickets for the All Blacks game while he is at it?</p>]
[<p eid="para_334">There was nobody here to do that. With all due respect, he is chairing the meeting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_438">I want to refer to lending to small and medium enterprises, SMEs, in particular. Mr. Boucher will be aware of Horizon 2020, the €80 billion European Union research and innovation programme which has given rise to the InnovFin fund from which Bank of Ireland, in partnership with the European Investment Fund, EIF, has an opportunity to avail of €100 million. How much of that €100 million has been divested for new lending since October 2015 when Bank of Ireland did the deal with the EIF?</p>]
[<p eid="para_440">I ask the question because I have a sense that at branch or regional level - I do not know if agriculture comes into that component - there is a lot of new lending to SMEs in gearing up for the position post-milk quotas. There is a lot of investment in agricultural lending also, but I have not seen any documentation or publication from Bank of Ireland on lending in the technology sector. If Bank of Ireland is not lending in the technology sector, an elemental part of the InnovFin fund, is it because there is reticence on the part of banks - I believe Bank of Ireland is the only bank that has drawn down funding from the InnovFin fund - to lend in the technology sector as the risk profile might be too high? I am trying to gain an understanding of where Bank of Ireland sits on lending in sectors other than, for instance, agriculture or traditional SMEs.</p>]
[<p eid="para_443">Is Mr. McLoughlin telling me that Bank of Ireland is lending in that sector?</p>]
[<p eid="para_445">It is actively engaged in lending.</p>]
[<p eid="para_447">Would it be possible for somebody to contact me or come back to the committee on the way that lending which is vital is emerging? If the economy is expected to grow and we are talking about the traditional lending profile, we will have to start looking at other areas such as the technology sector and start-ups, in particular.</p>]
[<p eid="para_449">To finish the point, Bank of Ireland will have to carry risk and the question is whether it is overly conservative about carrying some of it. We are all watching closely to see how the fund of €100 million will be divested.</p>]
[<p eid="para_451">Mr. Boucher mentioned Kernel Capital. I am familiar with Kernel Capital in Cork which is part of its footprint. How many jobs were created or what is the level of economic output as a result of investments by companies such as Kernel Capital, for instance? I am trying to gain an understanding of the matter. I do not expect Mr. Boucher to have the answer to that question now, but if somebody could revert to me on it, I would be very grateful.</p>]
[<p eid="para_453">How much new business does the bank generate from the national enterprise week? It has been firmly in the mix for quite a number of years and it is good profiling at local level for businesses, but does it generate new business for the bank or is it just a marketing tool?</p>]
[<p eid="para_455">We are under the cosh time-wise. I know Mr. Boucher has been here for a few hours and I am grateful for that. Are there definitive metrics in terms of the national enterprise week? I know he bolsters his troops to go out and generate new business. That is part of his <i>modus operandi</i>. What I am trying to understand is whether it generates new lending and new business and whether it works as a tool.</p>]
[<p eid="para_457">I want to ask about lending to the agricultural sector. I come from Cork and represent a dairy production area. Where is the Bank of Ireland with respect to the other banks in terms of competing for new business in that space? Is it highly competitive or behind the curve?</p>]
[<p eid="para_459">Regarding the Caherdavin example, it is not that we believe older people are not engaging with technology. It would be futile for anybody to suggest that because we are probably the closest to the people on the ground in that we represent them every day of the week. The angst in regard to the branches and how they are evolving relates to the deficit in the personal relationship. While people of all ages can engage with the bank's 365 online model - and that can lead to subsequent phone calls with a person - the concern is about the one-to-one banking relationship. It is in that context that we are to articulate the point regarding places, such as Caherdavin, where the bank has flashpoints. It is not an ageism issue. I am a customer of the excellent branch in Mallow. I have a relationship with the people there. Over the years, however, there has been a diminution of the traditional relationship, particularly in respect of people going into the branch to discuss new lending or borrowing for day-to-day services. That is the point we are trying to articulate. Traditionally, the pillar banks always had that relationship with the person on the street. We recognise that the Bank of Ireland must evolve and move to a certain point and that there are cost elements involved, but it should not throw the baby out with the bathwater and move completely to an online process. If it were to do that, customers might leave. Customers need to know they are being listened to and they need to have eye contact with an official in the bank if they are transacting new business or even dealing with daily transactions. Does Mr. Boucher understand the point I am making?</p>]
[<p eid="para_461">The bank has taken a big stake in rugby sponsorship. I am a Munster supporter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_463">It is welcome that the bank has a large footprint in the provinces. Is it possible for Mr. Boucher to answer how much that sponsorship is costing the bank and whether a proportion of that is filtering down into encouraging young people, male and female, into the game? My thinking here is from a CSR perspective, as opposed to mere sponsorship and getting the name out there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_465">Mr. Boucher mentioned flags and Leinster. We are talking about corporate sponsorship and we are all interested in the growth of the game. I am interested in discovering whether parcels of that funding go into the development of the game among young people in particular. Mr. Farrell is nodding his head. Is there a message that Mr. Boucher wants to impart about how he is concerned about the future of the game and that this is not merely corporate sponsorship and about flags?</p>, <p eid="para_466">What I am trying to tease out is whether that sponsorship actually enhances the game.</p>]
