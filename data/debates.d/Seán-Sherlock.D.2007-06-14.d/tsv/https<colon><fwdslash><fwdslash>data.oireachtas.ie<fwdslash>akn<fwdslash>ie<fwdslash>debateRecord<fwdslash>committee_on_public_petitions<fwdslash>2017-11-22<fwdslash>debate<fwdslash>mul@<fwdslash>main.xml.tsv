[<p eid="para_9">Apologies have been received from Deputy Eugene Murphy and Senator Denis Landy. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.</p>]
[<p eid="para_10">I remind members, delegates and persons in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system.</p>, <p eid="para_11"> We will consider petition No. P000013/17 from Ms Tara O'Sullivan on how to make the new English junior certificate examination fairer by adding 30 extra minutes. I welcome Ms O'Sullivan and her colleagues. She submitted the petition in her own name but in so doing was assisted by three of her fellow students, Ms Adrianne Ward, Ms Ellen McKimm and Ms Faye Dolan who have accompanied her to present it. We are delighted to have them before the committee. This is a significant day for them as secondary school students in appearing before a parliamentary committee, as it is for members. They are the first petitioners to be invited to appear before the committee since it was established in July 2016. It is, therefore, a momentous occasion for those on both sides of the equation. We compliment them on taking the initiative and, as third year secondary school students, participating in the petitions process. They have submitted a petition on an issue about which they all feel passionately. It took great strength of character to have the confidence to engage in the petitions process. As Chairman of the committee, I want to see more engagement of this nature. The committee is absolutely delighted that we have four formidable young people who are blazing a trail and setting the benchmark. We also welcome their parents and members of the school community who are in the Visitors Gallery. I am sure they are all extremely proud in seeing four formidable young women presenting before a parliamentary committee.</p>, <p eid="para_12"> Before I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission, I wish to update her on a few developments. The committee deliberated once again on the petition in private session and agreed to further actions in it progression. It has agreed to forward to her a copy of the latest response received from the Department of Education and Skills. We will seek submissions from the Irish Second-Level Students Union and the Teaching Council of Ireland on their views on the duration of the English junior certificate examination and the importance of holding mock examinations. We will invite the State Examinations Commission to appear once again before the committee in early 2018 - because of the nature of the work programme, it will not happen before then - to provide an update on the progress made in its engagement with stakeholders and their feedback on the service it provides.</p>, <p eid="para_13"> Ms O'Sullivan made a pertinent and appropriate point about the use of plain English. It was well made. The committee is acutely conscious of it and will have further discussions on how we can work through the issues involved. It is important that those who petition Parliament do not face impenetrable language. The language used has to be as accessible as possible to all people, regardless of who they are. The point was well made and we are working on the issue. I ask Ms O'Sullivan to address the petition and take at face value that we are working through the plain English element. In advance of her commencing her presentation, in accordance with procedure - this is where the language used gets at little legalistic - it is important that I read the note on privilege which is part of our protocols in Parliament.</p>, <p eid="para_14"> By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p>, <p eid="para_15"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. A copy of the petition has been circulated to them. </p>, <p eid="para_16"> Without further ado, I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission.</p>]
[<p eid="para_19">There shall be no ageism before this committee.</p>]
[<p eid="para_26">I thank Ms O'Sullivan for her very comprehensive submission. I will now open up the discussion to members who want to interact with the witnesses by way of questions and answers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_30">Does the Deputy have any supplementary questions on that issue?</p>]
[<p eid="para_36">To be helpful, all four witnesses should feel free to respond. We want to hear all four voices.</p>]
[<p eid="para_66">And in the 1980s.</p>]
[<p eid="para_80">I will address one or two of the points made. The line committee, the committee that would have competence in relation to content, etc., would be the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. We are currently engaged with that committee on some of the issues highlighted.</p>, <p eid="para_81"> One of the points that threw itself up in lights for me was the issue of how the content within the Civic, Social and Political Education, CSPE, subject relates to the role of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions of Parliament. That is a major takeaway for me.</p>, <p eid="para_82"> The petition remains open. We will take on board some of the points the petitioners have made here today. We will engage further with the stakeholders involved. If the final outcome of this is that there is no change or the <i>status quo</i> remains, what is most important, both for me and for the members, is that the petitioners are here before an Oireachtas committee, they have taken the time to put forward a petition and they have impressed us with their depth of knowledge in terms of answers that they have given to questions. In the first instance, any of their cohort who are looking at this, anybody throughout the country, any teacher worth his or her salt, will use this segment of their submission as a teaching tool to educate their fellow students about what they, too, can do on issues of public concern and they now have the ability to come forward and make submissions to a petitions committee.</p>, <p eid="para_83"> If they do not get the desired outcome, I would say: "That's life." One will accept the results, one way or the other. It may go your way and it may not. However, the fact that they have been here before us today is as, if not even more, important because it clearly signals to us that there are excellent young people out there. Like Deputy Dara Murphy, I do not want to patronise the petitioners in any way but I am not sure whether I would have had the confidence when I was going through my junior certificate if somebody had invited me in to the Committee on Public Petitions or any committee of the DÃ¡il to make a submission. I am here as a Member of the House but on a personal level, I do not think I would have had the confidence to do what they have done.</p>, <p eid="para_84"> We are very grateful to the petitioners for coming before the committee today. If I may say, the Loreto ethos, with which I have personal interaction in my own part of the world, is alive and well. The petitioners are fine examples, not only of that ethos but of the best what we have to offer, and what the future holds. If four articulate students such as these can come before us and hold themselves with dignity in front of an Oireachtas committee, they are up there with the best of them. I thank them very much for being here.</p>, <p eid="para_85"> We wish the petitioners well in their continuing studies. I hope that everything went or will go well for them, in terms of the junior certificate examinations. I am hoping that in life everything will go well for them because they have been a fine example of the best that we have to offer in this country, and I mean that sincerely.</p>, <p eid="para_86"> I will adjourn the meeting now. We will make refreshments available to the petitioners afterwards. We have a little pack to give them as well, just as a little gift. We hope that there are hundreds, and possibly thousands, of students who will look at this. We hope that teachers will look at this and use it in the best possible way as an example of what the Committee on Public Petitions is available to do for people. I thank our guests for being here. We are delighted to have them.</p>]
