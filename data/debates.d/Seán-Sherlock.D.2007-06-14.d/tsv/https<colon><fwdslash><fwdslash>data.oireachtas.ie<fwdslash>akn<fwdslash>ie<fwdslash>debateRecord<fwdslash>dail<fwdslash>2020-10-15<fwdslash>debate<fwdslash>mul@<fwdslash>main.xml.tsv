[<p eid="para_270">I wish to address the same issue. It relates to Cork Airport and the loss of Ryanair jobs there. There is a call from the airport stakeholders that the EU's traffic light system for international travel be adopted because that would give a fighting chance to airports like those at Cork and Shannon. I raised this issue last week and ask again that the Cabinet give the green light to this system as soon as possible to give airports like Cork Airport a fighting chance so we can grow the routes again. I express my solidarity with the Ryanair workers at Cork Airport and Shannon Airport who are now in a very precarious position, as are workers in other airlines. While the package of measures - some €10 million for the two regional airports - announced by the Government is welcome, I ask the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Cabinet to look at this again. It is vital that a decision on the implementation of the EU traffic light system for international travel be made as quickly as possible.</p>]
