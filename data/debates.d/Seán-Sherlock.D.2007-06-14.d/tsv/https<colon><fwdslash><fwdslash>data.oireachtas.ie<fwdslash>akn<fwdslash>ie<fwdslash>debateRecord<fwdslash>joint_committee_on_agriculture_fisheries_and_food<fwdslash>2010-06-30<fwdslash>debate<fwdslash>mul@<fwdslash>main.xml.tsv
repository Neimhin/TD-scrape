[<p eid="para_42">I welcome the departmental officials.  It is not realistic to expect local authorities, in an economic downturn, to police the provisions of the Control of Horses Act 1996.  They cannot be expected to look after wandering horses and to do what is necessary to ensure the welfare of horses is maintained.  The problem is what could be described as the informal horse sector where people put horses onto land that may be perceived to be in public ownership.  There is no chance these animals are microchipped.  Local authority officials would have a difficult time seeking to identify the owners and even if they could find them and were to tell them that the law states they must have their animals microchipped, they would probably be laughed at.</p>, <p eid="para_43">I do not want to seem cynical but the notion of maintaining a protocol is unrealistic because the resources are not there to back it up.  Notwithstanding the positive aspirations of the Department, the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council and the animal welfare groups, the situation remains that horses are being left to wander on public lands and there is no oversight in terms of how they are treated.  It is very easy to discover the owner of a horse when that animal is on privately owned land.  The problem arises in regard to the informal ownership structure that exists.  It is not easy to police ownership of horses where they are kept on public lands.</p>, <p eid="para_44">How do we bridge the gap?  Is it the case that we need to reach out to owners of horses in the larger metropolitan areas to ensure, in the first instance, that they are not ignorant of the law and that they are educated about animal welfare issues?  The rate of abandonment of horses last winter because of the severe weather conditions was disgraceful.  Is it time now to build relationships with these people?  It seems that the people who own horses in the large conurbations are not part of any formal structure and that no one has approached them in regard to putting in place a structure to ensure they maintain their horses in a proper fashion.  I am interested in the officials' views in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_45">We are all aware of the implications of the Control of Horses Act, but it does not seem relevant to many horse owners in urban settings.  There is possibly a large ignorance of the law in respect of the obligations of owners and, as I said, I wonder how we can bridge that gap.  I am interested to hear whether there are ideas within the Department as to how that can be done and whether the political impetus is there to follow that through.  We must do everything possible to ensure the welfare of horses in urban areas.</p>]
[<p eid="para_53">How far back in time is the Chairman going?</p>]
[<p eid="para_71">On a point of order and forgive my ignorance, but is Deputy O'Sullivan suggesting that a premium be paid directly to owners to slaughter their horses because they cannot keep the animals any longer?</p>]
