SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The credit union movement is a little perturbed by the fact that the legislation will be implemented in advance of a strategic review and to its mind the consultation process will be a waste of time after the fact.  Credit unions hope for proper consultation in advance of the legislation being passed or perhaps a parking of the legislation until such time as they can get down to the nitty gritty of the details of how it will impact on them in the long term.  A strategic review after the legislation is passed seems to the credit unions to be quite a waste of time and their perception is that the Registrar of Credit Unions is driving a coach and four through any initiatives or views they have on how the new sections 35A and 35B will affect them.  They also have a perception that they have already made adequate provisioning arrangements.  They believe there is a relatively decent reserve in position and they are well placed to withstand any economic downturn or anything that may change within the 12 to 18 month period.  What is Mr. O'Brien's view on this?  If he were to communicate a message to the credit unions through this forum what would he state on this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does Mr. O'Brien have regard for the fact that because of the new provisioning arrangements and the reserve requirements many credit unions will find it more difficult to pay dividends and surpluses?  This could in the long term undermine the credit union movement.  If one does not get a return why should one invest in an individual credit union?  Credit unions take a view that they have voluntarily introduced new parameters on provisioning requirements.  Some will argue that there have been increases of anything up to 40% in the reserves of individual credit unions to meet any onslaught or potential problems that might arise.At present, credit unions have a sense that Mr. O'Brien is not in a position to bargain, negotiate or even consult.  Their perception is that Mr. O'Brien will drive on and adopt a "one size fits all" approach.  He may extrapolate from the results he elucidated to Deputy O'Donnell on reserves and the increasing pressure that exists for 100 loan books.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Are they representative of the overall credit union sector?  Do we need to look more closely at those 100 loan books?  What was the product mix and what was the mix of credit unions examined?  If Mr. O'Brien takes a unilateral approach he will potentially impact on the ability of credit unions to draw in new customers if the reserve and provisioning requirements are so stringent that they will not be able to pay out dividends even though their loan books might be performing quite well.What I am trying to get across is the idea that there may be a sense in which the Minister has bought into a view on sections 35A and 35B.  In his Second Stage speech, he stated:The Registrar of Credit Unions will adopt a balanced and proportionate approach in the application of the loan provisioning requirements which are proposed to be introduced.  Depending on the circumstances, a missed repayment on a rescheduled loan may not always trigger a full provision against the loan provided that the credit union is satisfied that the loan continues to perform in accordance with its new terms.It could be argued that it is giving them a carte blanche, but that the ability of the individual credit union to know its customer and have a personal relationship with him or her is being overridden by the new provisions which it will impose.  That is something which needs to be teased out because in the future one does not want tension to exist between the registrar and individual credit unions, thereby having a negative impact on their ability to pay dividends.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What were the representative bodies?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What was its position regarding section 35(a) when it was sitting in the room with the delegation?  
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	A position was articulated to us in the committee and I am sure the delegates have read the transcripts.  The Minister has a very clear position on section 35(a), as does Mr. O’Brien.  Where is the breakdown, if this was a consultative process?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate that.  I have one final question regarding the appropriate processes, procedures and systems that will have to be put in place to meet the requirements of section 35(b).  What does the delegation envisage in that provision?  It could arguably place a massive cost burden on individual credit unions as a result of updating information technology systems and other such processes.  I want to get a sense of the current position of the delegation.  
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is how one determines the power.  Is it a soft power or a hard power?  Will Mr. O'Brien beat them with a stick or coax them along gently in a consultative fashion?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If I was a member of a credit union representative body, I would be distrustful of the process outlined by the delegates.  The legislation is being amended to provide certain powers.  Mr. O'Brien may say he intends to consult widely on individual scenarios, but that is an easy commitment to give.  A credit union representative would ask why the legislation was being changed before the strategic review was completed.  Surely it would be preferable to park the legislation until the review and consultations have been carried out.  It could be wrapped up by the autumn or winter and there would be a clearly defined set of goals for each of the legislative, regulatory and representative sides.  What is Mr. O'Brien's view of this proposal?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does that not make a mockery of a subsequent strategic review?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are looking at the legislation, yet Mr. O'Brien is calling for another review later.  Why not include this aspect in the strategic review?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Mr. McMahon is describing apples and oranges.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What is the mix of those credit unions if they form a representative sample?  Are they large-scale credit unions, small credit unions or a mix?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does Mr. O'Brien envisage a time when every credit union, before paying out a dividend, nominal or otherwise, would have to notify the registrar regardless of whether they are in deficit or otherwise?
