SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2012-10-17T15:50:00+01:00	I thank Deputy Butler for raising this issue. As a Government, we have moved decisively to restructure the banking system and ensure that it provides credit to the economy every year. We are also acting to fill gaps where specific market failures exist. The Deputy will be aware that the Department has introduced two targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit for small businesses into the economy. I attended the launch of the credit guarantee scheme this morning, which was presided over by the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. The guarantee scheme will go live next Wednesday, 24 October, and is expected to provide an additional €150 million per annum in lending for small businesses over the next three years. Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the scheme. The guarantee scheme is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable micro, small and medium-sized businesses in two specific situations, namely, where businesses have insufficient collateral and where businesses operate in sectors with which the banks are not familiar. It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. Each €150 million of additional lending under the scheme is expected to benefit over 1,800 businesses and create over 1,300 jobs. Another important initiative developed by the Department is the €90 million microfinance loan fund to address access to credit and support lending to the most vulnerable cohort of our SME sector, namely, microenterprises. Microfinance Ireland was launched on 27 September and has been open for business since 1 October. It will provide loans primarily to newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors, with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. Loans will be for amounts of less than €25,000 and will be generally provided for business start-up costs, expansion costs and working capital. The thrust of the lending policy will always be focused strongly on the potential sustainability of the business, its ability to repay the loan and the creation and maintenance of jobs. It is intended that the fund will provide loans to some 5,500 microenterprises over time, resulting in the creation of approximately 8,000 jobs at a cost of approximately €2,500 per job, which is extremely good value for the State's investment, when referenced against foreign direct investment. To assist medium-sized business, we introduced the €150 million development capital fund scheme earlier this year. This will assist in increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the so-called equity gap experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in excess of €2 million. The development capital scheme is aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth, Irish businesses with significant prospects for growth and job creation. Typical companies expected to benefit are those with in the region of 60-160 employees. Further work with the banks is continuing to adapt to the needs of the non-traditional sectors, such as the technology and emerging sectors. Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth, including start-ups, early stage and mature companies and to adopt cash flow lending as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years. Knowledge sharing is ongoing, including reciprocal secondments from Enterprise Ireland directly into the banks, sector briefings and trade mission involvement. In addition, the Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office to evaluate evidence on credit availability and to ensure that the amount of credit flowing to the SME sector is maximised to facilitate sustainable job creation and retention. I refer the Deputy to pages 68 and 69 of the third progress report, which speaks further to the issue raised by him.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-10-17T15:50:00+01:00	It is hard not to agree with the points made by the Deputy in relation the banking sector. A distinction must be made between businesses seeking to restructure loans in order to survive and retain their viability and loans generated for new business. I refer the Deputy to the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and the third progress report which states that the Department of Finance published the SME lending demand survey in July. That survey of 1,505 companies shows that during the six month period surveyed demand for credit remained low, with only 38% of SMEs requesting bank credit between October 2011 to March 2012. The full survey and findings are available on the Department of Finance website. I take on board the points made by the Deputy in relation to the person referenced specifically by him. I believe the Taoiseach addressed that point today during Leaders' Questions. This is about driving new relationships between Enterprise Ireland and the pillar banks.The Economic Management Council has already indicated it will meet the pillar banks before the end of the year. There is no question that there is a sense the banks are not coming forward with proposals based on a lateral view of how to solve the problems of the person referenced by the Deputy who may have a viable business. The Government is trying to press home this point to the banks. There is a role for the Economic Management Council. The two initiatives, on micro-enterprises and the partial loan credit guarantee scheme, will create a new pillar of lending and will be government backed. This will have a knock-on effect on the SME sector of the economy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-10-17T16:00:00+01:00	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I thank the Deputy for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the position on the application for additional accommodation received from Millstreet Convent national school, County Cork. It is a co-educational primary school catering for boys and girls from junior infants to second class and for girls only from third to sixth class. I am aware the school had 218 enrolled pupils in September 2011 and that the current enrolment is 244 pupils, as the Deputy outlined. I understand the school expects enrolments to increase further next September 2013. On 5 October the Department of Education and Skills received an application from the school for the provision of one additional mainstream classroom and two learning support rooms to meet its current needs. In addition, the Department received a further application from the school on 15 October for major capital funding to provide additional mainstream classrooms to cater for the school's projected longer term enrolments. In this regard, the Department of Education and Skills will examine the demographics of the area concerned. The analysis will take into account results from census 2011, child benefit data for the area and an examination of current school enrolments with a view to establishing future accommodation requirements for the area. The school's applications will be assessed in the context of the Department's analysis of need in the area and a decision on the applications will be conveyed to the school authority subsequently. The Deputy will be aware that the five year programme which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, announced on 12 March 2012 will provide more than 100,000 permanent school places, of which 80,000 will be new school places. The remainder will be the replacement of temporary or unsatisfactory accommodation. Where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher, and where a school's existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, the Department considers applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms, mainly on a devolved basis. The delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2012-10-17T16:00:00+01:00	I note the Deputy's concerns in this regard and the points he has made on the school's developing school status. I reiterate that the Department will be in contact with the school when the demographic analysis in the area has been completed.If, through the good offices of the Deputy, the board of management was to contact me directly, I would be happy to engage with the school, subject to all of the criteria, particularly the budgetary criteria, laid down in that regard. Perhaps we can take a look at this with a view to solving the problem without giving any false hope at this stage. I would be happy to visit the school if such an invitation was extended to me. I am not making any promises but there may be ways around this. It is important that the Department has the opportunity to complete the vital demographic study.
