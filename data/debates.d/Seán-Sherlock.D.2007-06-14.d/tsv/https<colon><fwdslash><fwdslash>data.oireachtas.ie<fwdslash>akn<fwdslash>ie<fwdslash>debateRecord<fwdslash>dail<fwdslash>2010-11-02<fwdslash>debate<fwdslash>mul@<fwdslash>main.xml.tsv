SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Can we expect the publication of the Dublin commission's report in respect of matters being investigated in the diocese of Cloyne?The Fines Act 2010 was enacted this year.  The commencement order has not been signed yet.  I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter.  When is the exact date for the commencement of the legislation?  Its purpose is to make imprisonment a last resort on default of payment of a fine.  In other words——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——people are still being committed to prison for non-payment of fines——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——in spite of the fact that we have enacted the legislation in this House.  We are already hearing reports about Cork Prison and other prisons being overcrowded.  They are partly overcrowded because of such situations.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When will we see the commencement of that legislation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, am I given to understand then that the negotiations on the appointment of the receiver have concluded and that the Taoiseach is satisfied that the Act will commence on 1 January?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I expect Deputy Durkan knows it off by heart.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I should like to share time with Deputy Arthur Morgan, with the permission of the House.I, too, on behalf of the Labour Party, welcome this legislation.  As with any consolidation Bill, it is for the purposes of simplifying procedures and that is to be welcomed.  It will potentially reduce the compliance burden on small and family businesses and family farms, and this is to be welcomed.I noted the Minister of State's remarks on the January 1982 budget.  My late father played no small part in that particular decision as regards VAT on children's shoes, so that is a decision which has worked its way into the annals of our family, and we are proud of it.  There is not much to be said, apart from acknowledging it as being a fine body of work.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, instigated by Deputy Ruairí Quinn, had a similar type of effect.  However, the 1997 Act has been amended in every Finance Bill since, and arguably has led to an unwieldy tax system.  One hopes that this legislation will remain as codified and in that sense, retain its purity.There is not much more to be said.  We have some amendments in respect of certain parts of the Bill, but nothing substantive.  We shall deal with those on Committee Stage.  We congratulate the Minister, officials of the Department and everyone who had a part in drafting the legislation.  It was no easy task and they are to be commended.
