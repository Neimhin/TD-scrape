[<p eid="para_199">We are all agreed on the need to transpose the directive and to adopt a proper approach in meeting our bio-fuels obligations.  While there might be a different emphasis on certain aspects of the directive, there is broad agreement on the need to do it properly and act with haste.  I am three years into my first mandate here.  I fail to understand why we are legislating in this way.  It seems to me that the windfall levy — the carbon levy — should be provided for in a completely separate and distinct Bill.  Given its importance, I do not understand why it is being tacked on to this legislation.  This legislative provision is not a mere administrative detail.  It will have serious permutations for industry.  I do not doubt that it will be challenged.  The lawyers will have a field day on this one.  I do not understand why the amendment in question is to be introduced on Report Stage.  It does not make sense.  Many of the procedures that govern this House belie common sense.  It does not make an ounce of sense for the Government to proceed in this manner.  I wonder why that is the case.  I assume the Minister is relying on the advice of the Attorney General.  Perhaps the amendment was not presented to us on Committee Stage because advice is outstanding.  I do not know.  It does not make sense for this Legislature to introduce something as significant as a carbon levy in this manner, as part of the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  The Labour Party does not support the manner in which it is being introduced.</p>]
