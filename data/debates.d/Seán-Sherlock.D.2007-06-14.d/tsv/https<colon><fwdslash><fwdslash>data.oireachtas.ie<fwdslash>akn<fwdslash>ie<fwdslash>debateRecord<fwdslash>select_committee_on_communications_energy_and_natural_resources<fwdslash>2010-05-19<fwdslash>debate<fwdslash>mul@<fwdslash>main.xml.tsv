SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:" "bioethanol" shall only be deemed to constitute a biofuel in the case of ethylalcohol ex CN (Combined nomenclature) sub heading Taric code 2207 1000 with an alcohol content of at least 99 per cent volume the properties of which comply at least with the requirements set in document EN 15376:2007 by the EU Committee for Standardisation (CEN) or any subsequent revisions to this document;".There has already been significant debate on this matter.  I take the Minister's Second Stage point about the introduction of regulations after enactment and the time lags in notifications to the European Commission.  This amendment, however, is to lay down in the legislation a definitive move to stimulate local bio-fuel production.  The domestic bio-fuel industry has supported our amendments in this regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 6, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:" "commencement date" shall mean 1 January 2013;".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 7, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:" "EN15376" shall have the meaning prescribed to it in document "EN 15376:2007 Automotive fuels — Ethanol as a blending component for petrol — Requirements and test methods" or any subsequent revisions to this document by the EU Committee for Standardisation;".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 8, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:" "Taric code 2207 1000" shall have the meaning prescribed to it in Commission Regulation EC NO 948/2009 of 30 Sept 2009 amending Annex 1 to Council Regulations (EEC) No. 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.  The duty is to be applied in accordance with Taric code 2207 1000 — Undenatured ethyl alcohol of an alcoholic strength by volume of 80% vol or higher;".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 10, line 33, to delete "the internet" and substitute "the Minister's website".These are straightforward technical amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 36:
In page 30, to delete lines 38 to 51 and in page 31, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:"44X.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), the Minister, having regard to the need to increase the security of supply of transport fuels, to promote the use of biofuels that meet certain minimum standards and to ensure the protection of consumers of biofuels, may make regulations prescribing minimum standards and specifying certain EU Taric codes in relation to biofuels consumed or disposed of by sale or otherwise in the State, which are required to be met for the purpose of making an application under section 44G for a biofuel obligation certificate.(2) Regulations under this section may prescribe—(a) different minimum standards and Taric codes in respect of different classes of biofuels, and(b) different dates in respect of the coming into force of different minimum standards prescribed by the regulations.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 44:
In page 31, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"(b) by substituting the following for the definition of “Minister”:" ‘Minister' means the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources;",".This technical amendment is self-explanatory.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are all agreed on the need to transpose the directive and to adopt a proper approach in meeting our bio-fuels obligations.  While there might be a different emphasis on certain aspects of the directive, there is broad agreement on the need to do it properly and act with haste.  I am three years into my first mandate here.  I fail to understand why we are legislating in this way.  It seems to me that the windfall levy — the carbon levy — should be provided for in a completely separate and distinct Bill.  Given its importance, I do not understand why it is being tacked on to this legislation.  This legislative provision is not a mere administrative detail.  It will have serious permutations for industry.  I do not doubt that it will be challenged.  The lawyers will have a field day on this one.  I do not understand why the amendment in question is to be introduced on Report Stage.  It does not make sense.  Many of the procedures that govern this House belie common sense.  It does not make an ounce of sense for the Government to proceed in this manner.  I wonder why that is the case.  I assume the Minister is relying on the advice of the Attorney General.  Perhaps the amendment was not presented to us on Committee Stage because advice is outstanding.  I do not know.  It does not make sense for this Legislature to introduce something as significant as a carbon levy in this manner, as part of the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  The Labour Party does not support the manner in which it is being introduced.
