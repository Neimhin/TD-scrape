[<p eid="para_667">I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Creed, is in the House to reply to the query. Haulbowline Island, as we know, has been the subject of remediation works since 2011 and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the current owner of the site, which is the former Ispat or Irish Steel site. We know the East Tip of the island has been significantly remediated in the last year or so and there is great praise for the work that has been done in respect of the football pitch and the East Tip itself being completed, with proper seeding and shrubbery being planted, and so on. However, there is a question mark over the remainder of the site. My understanding is that three sites were to be remediated. The East Tip is arguably all but complete and there has been much progress on that. I am here to ask the Minister about the status of the remainder of the works and when they will be completed. There is massive expectation on the part of the people who reside in that area, particularly the people of Great Island and Cobh. We know Spike Island has become a global tourist attraction and there is a high expectation that Haulbowline would be completed and remediated in a timely fashion.</p>, <p eid="para_668"> I hope the Minister will not respond by saying the ownership of the site is to transfer to the Department of Defence and it then will take ownership of the issue. As far as the people of Great Island are concerned, this is a whole-of-Government issue which should be responded to by everybody across Government. I am hopeful there will not be a turf war between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Defence in respect of the remainder of the works that need to be done. In fairness to the Minister, he has taken ownership of this issue thus far. He stated the remediation works would intensify between July 2017 and late 2018, which has proven to be the case, as I acknowledge. I am hopeful the Government will take a whole-of-Government approach to this issue. I would specifically like to know if there is a funding line available and earmarked for the remainder of the works to be carried out. I ask the Minister to explain the exact position in respect of the site because the expectations are high in the area that the remediation works will be completed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_674">I accept the Minister's response. While I have the greatest respect for him, I believe what we are seeing is a transfer of authority from the Minister to the Department of Defence, although it has not happened yet. I reiterate the point that, as far as the people of the Great Island and Cobh and the surrounding areas are concerned, this is a whole-of-Government responsibility and they do not necessarily see into the internal workings of the various silos within Government and between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Defence.</p>, <p eid="para_675"> Some €61 million was originally allocated for this during the lifetime of the last Government and my understanding is that only €23 million has been spent so far. We acknowledge the work done thus far but there is more to be done, for example, a significant amount of site remediation work. I have not had a clear answer from Government in respect of when that will happen. We know the recreational park will open some time in 2019 and that will add significantly to the public use value of the site, which is a positive public good. However, we need to hear from the Government specific answers to specific questions as to whether the remainder of the fund will be made available to do the work at the South Tip and at the former steel plant itself. To my mind, the Minister has not responded satisfactorily in that respect.</p>, <p eid="para_676"> I ask the Government to revisit the issue and give us a clear picture of what the likely outcome will be, given there was a ring-fenced allocation of approximately €60 million in funding and that has not been spent. Are we now given to understand this has been shelved in favour of other priorities in the capital programme? It is an important issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_741">The Labour Party unambiguously welcomes the Bill and acknowledges the work of the Minister and the Minister of State in bringing it before the House. The Bill is clear in what it seeks to achieve. I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service and congratulate Ms Liane Reddy, the parliamentary researcher who compiled the Bill digest and raised some very interesting points in the process.</p>, <p eid="para_742"> I note that the United Kingdom is one of the signatories to the Istanbul Convention. In the context of Brexit negotiations, has there been any discussion within the Department of Justice and Equality on how Brexit may impact on the interpretation of this legislation <i>vis-à-vis</i> our relationship with the United Kingdom given the close ties that exist between the two countries? It is a very theoretical question at this stage. It may be that because the United Kingdom is a signatory to the convention which has a certain date stamp, Brexit will have no implications in that regard. It would be very useful to have that clarified.</p>, <p eid="para_743"> Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, states that a Government action plan to give voice to the Istanbul Convention is in place and relates to issues such as education and training modules for An Garda Síochána, the HSE, Tusla and the Courts Service. Is the Minister of State satisfied that adequate ongoing training and education is in place? Has An Garda Síochána implemented what Cosc describes as the risk assessment matrix? I do not fully understand what constitutes a risk assessment matrix. It would be useful for that to be explained and to clarify whether it is ongoing. Is there an integrated 24-hour national helpline to respond to the issues pertinent to the legislation? Cosc also raises the issue of support for child witnesses of domestic or sexual violence. Is the Minister satisfied that programmes, protocols or procedures are in place in respect of those issues?</p>, <p eid="para_744"> My party very much welcomes the Bill. I again refer to the Bills digest, which was very useful in gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of the legislation. In respect of the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction it states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_745">However, there is a "growing list of situations in which offences committed outside Irish territory are subject to the jurisdiction of an Irish court." This is largely due to the effects of globalisation, and an acceptance by the international community “that it has a common obligation to tackle certain forms of criminal enterprise that threaten fundamental interests transcending national boundaries.” As Ireland assumes obligations under an increasing number of international agreements, the extent to which Irish citizens and those ordinarily resident in Ireland may be prosecuted for acts done outside the State has also increased.</p>, <p eid="para_746">It then refers to sections of Acts such as the Domestic Violence Act 2018 and the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, and to section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation Act) 2012. The digest also addresses the issue of Irish-registered ships or aircraft, stating:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_747">The fact that a ship or aircraft is registered in Ireland does not automatically mean that it is Irish territory for the purpose of criminal jurisdiction once it leaves Irish territorial waters or airspace. However certain statutory provisions confer that jurisdiction on them where certain criminal offences are committed on board, irrespective of the nationality of the offender.</p>, <p eid="para_748">What is the perspective of his Department on that dynamic? Is this legislation pertinent to such scenarios?</p>, <p eid="para_749"> The Labour Party fully supports the Bill.</p>]
[<p eid="para_752">On a point of order, I was not making a political point. Rather, I was merely asking a question, the answer to which I had anticipated. For the record, I asked the question in good faith and with good intentions.</p>]
