SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-15T16:20:00+00:00	I also welcome the Minister of State as a former member of the committee. While we are on very friendly terms and I am conscious of not throwing any brickbats at her, I have some very direct questions. I think she will appreciate that. I represent the area covered by community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4, which comprises Kerry, north Cork, north Lee and south Lee. Of the €7.8 million that was allocated for the 6,558 people, €1.1 million was allocated to CHO 4. The Minister of State said that as of 30 June, a total of 1,798 assessments of need have been completed over September to November, inclusive. Will she provide me with a breakdown of how this cuts across CHO 4? I ask because it is still not clear to me whether these assessments of need, which the Minister of State says are historical, are under the new SOP and are, therefore, under the 90-minute bracket. If the answer is that they are, then, given evidence that has come before the committee, I have serious concerns about that. The case for CHO 4 can be extrapolated to all the CHOs in the country. I need some words of comfort from the Minister of State for the families and children whom I represent so that they do not come back to me in a matter of months, having received the initial assessment of need, to say there has been no follow-up of services, or saying the assessment of need, as previous witnesses have suggested, is a sub-par method by any international standard of assessing a child with needs. That is the first reassurance I seek.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-15T16:20:00+00:00	That is not the 90-minute desktop assessment but a full and proper assessment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-15T16:20:00+00:00	I thank the Minister of State. As this will be an ongoing issue, I would appreciate if she offered to communicate with the committee's Chairman to give figures for each of the CHOs to assess those numbers on an ongoing basis. This would be very useful. We will put down our own parliamentary questions anyway. When the ombudsman was before the committee, he suggested without any ambiguity that some sort of a refund scheme could be established for those families who wished to procure private assessments. The Minister of State, in a parliamentary reply to me dated 30 October 2020, referred to a letter from Dr. Cathal Morgan in which it was stated that, in relation to Sláintecare funding, which is the €7.8 million provided on a once-off basis and which is time limited, the CHOs would engage with private providers in their areas to procure private assessments where appropriate.Will the Minister of State provide us with a breakdown of the cost and the number of private assessments? As I understand it, the €7.8 million is not fully allocated or spent yet. To what extent is that funding being given over to private providers? Once that funding is spent, is there scope for families who wish to seek private assessments to get a refund? That would provide a massive alleviation because the €7.8 million will not cover the full extent of the demand. That is the point I am making. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-15T16:30:00+00:00	I asked about a potential refund for families. After this backlog is cleared, or even if this backlog is cleared, there will always be demand and the resources will not always follow. The Minister of State will know from her own experience that families are forced into a situation where they are waiting on the public list for an inordinate time. The pressure comes on them to take out a credit union loan to get a private assessment. All families will do that if needs be. Is there any scope, as per the ombudsman's suggestion, for some sort of recoupment of those costs for individual families at the family level? Could the State intervene to facilitate that family or, if the family made a request for the recoupment of expenses, could an application or some sort of protocol or process be set up to facilitate that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-12-15T16:30:00+00:00	That is an honest and fair answer. I accept that.
