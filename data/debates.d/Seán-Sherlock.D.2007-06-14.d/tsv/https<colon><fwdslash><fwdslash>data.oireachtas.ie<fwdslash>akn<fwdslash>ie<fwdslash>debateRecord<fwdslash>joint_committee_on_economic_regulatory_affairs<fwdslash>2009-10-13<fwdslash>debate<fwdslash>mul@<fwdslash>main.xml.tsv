SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I apologise for missing the initial contribution as I had to be in the Dáil Chamber.  Having read the submission in the meantime, I echo the points made by Deputy Kelly.I represent part of County Cork and the strong message I receive from local authority workers, particularly in the north of the county, is that the burden of health and safety legislation and regulation is impeding essential maintenance work.  Will Mr. O'Halloran clarify the role of the Health and Safety Authority in the area of road maintenance as opposed to construction?  Without wishing to raise spurious examples, many roads in north Cork are in poor state and require works to be done to fill potholes.  Perhaps I am lacking knowledge in this respect but I understand a crew comprised of four or five local authority personnel which wishes to fill a pothole must first erect signage on both approaches, install a signalling system and erect bollards.  This is ludicrous.  I am not aware of legislative provisions requiring such measures to be taken to comply with health and safety regulations when filling a pothole.  Health and safety regulation has become excessive and the health and safety industry has mushroomed in the past decade.Members of the Oireachtas are legitimately the subjects of remarkable levels of scrutiny.  Similar scrutiny should apply to the €22.6 million annual budget of the Health and Safety Authority.  With the virtual demise of the construction industry in recent years, I presume the agency's 126 inspectors have less work to do.  Where are their skills being employed?  Some €13.5 million of the HSA budget is expended on wages, while €2.2 million is spent on accommodation and €1 million alone is spent on travel and subsistence.  These figures add up to €16.7 million.As a layman in this matter, I take the forthright view that health and safety legislation places an undue burden on the ability of companies to carry out work.  We have lost the ability to employ a degree of common sense, as is borne out by my point that a whole industry has grown up around health and safety legislation.  Perhaps we should withdraw some of the burden in the light of the downturn in the economy.The issue of generic accidents at work was raised, particularly in agriculture, a sector in which I have a particular interest.  Many of these accidents can be ascribed to human error.  I do not agree that the HSA should send an inspector to every farm.  Adults who operate a business must assume a degree of responsibility for their day-to-day activities.  While I sympathise with anyone who has a workplace accident - God knows, I am aware of many who have had this misfortune - there is a degree of human error for which one cannot legislate and upon which one should not impose a regulatory regime, especially one which costs €22.6 million to the Exchequer every year in a period of major economic contraction.I am raising these matters to elicit an opinion from Mr. O'Halloran.  There may be a valid justification for the authority's budget in the current climate.  What is the average salary of a field inspector?  A distinction was made between policy and field inspectors.  If there are 197 staff, of whom 126 are inspectors, what is the role and function of the remaining 71 employees in the organisation?Reference was made to a judicial review in connection with local authorities.  I did not understand the point that was being made, although I may have misheard it.  I seek clarification on the process of judicial review and the demarcation between the role of the Health and Safety Authority and that of local authorities.
