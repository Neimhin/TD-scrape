I would welcome any clarity on that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-07T16:00:00+00:00	I wish to clarify something Dr. O'Mara mentioned. He said that output is outpacing efficiency gains in respect of the national herd. He referred specifically to milk production. In layman's terms, I would like to gain an understanding of how that gap is being narrowed or closed. A question arises if the gap is narrowed and one has maximum efficiency gains, and one is still planning on increasing output. If I understand the interventions correctly, output will keep increasing. We will continue to produce beef and more milk or milk products or derivatives thereof. If that is where we have put our eggs in terms of the market - Dr. O'Mara keeps referring to the market - then how do we close the gap? If we close the gap between efficiency gains and increases in output and if we were trying to peg it out in years, at what stage of the process will we get there?Will it be 2025, 2040, 2050 or 2100 by the time the gap is closed? The IPCC's report has brought what we are facing into stark focus. This morning I got a sense of the work the Department was doing, which is laudable, but there was no great sense of urgency, particularly in forestry and making efficiency gains. I say this because tackling climate change requires resources. In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance spoke about the environment efficiency pilot scheme for the beef section, yet I do not know what is the overall figure for the scheme. When one examines the initiative a little, it seems that it will cost â‚¬40 per cow and that the weight of cows will have to be recorded at marts. Has the rhetoric at the working groups of the European Union changed owing to the 40% figure in the CAP negotiations? Can the rhetoric be tracked to dialogue within the Department that states, "If we keep going the way we are, we are going to far surpass the target set of 32.3% for Ireland's overall emissions in agriculture"? I firmly believe we cannot maintain such a trajectory. I am trying to be evidence-based in dealing with this matter. Based on the interventions made today, it seems that there is no way in hell that we will be able reach the figure of 32.3% at the current rate of intervention. It is just an impossibility. I would prefer the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to tell us how much we need in pounds, shillings and pence, outline what policy interventions are needed and how much money is required for same.  My last questions are about forestry. If I run out of time, the Secretary General can supply the committee with his answers in writing. Is 18% of the land area of the country under forestry? We are talking about schemes under which farmers will be paid X amount for 15 years. Surely we need to be telling them, "Do not farm that land any more because this is what we are going to pay you in perpetuity and your antecedents," because otherwise, frankly, we are on a hiding to nothing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-07T16:10:00+00:00	It would be helpful if we understood where we were in the negotiations on the CAP because it is an opportunity. I argue that everybody seated around this table wants a just transition for farmers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-07T16:10:00+00:00	One does not want to put farmers out of business overnight. We need to have a sense of how Ireland is influencing the negotiations on the CAP in order that we can ensure the transfers will be such that we will able to maximise research output and provide for the remuneration of farmers and those involved in agriculture in order that the targets to be reached can be reduced to manageable levels while maintaining outputs.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-07T16:10:00+00:00	Mr. Gleeson has done very well today considering that it is his first outing as Secretary General.
