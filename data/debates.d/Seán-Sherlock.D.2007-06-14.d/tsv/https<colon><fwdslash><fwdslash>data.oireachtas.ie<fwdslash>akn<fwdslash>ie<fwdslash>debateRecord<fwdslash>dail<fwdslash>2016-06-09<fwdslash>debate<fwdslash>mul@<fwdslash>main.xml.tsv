[<p eid="para_89">This is a citizens' assembly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">My first question relates to procedural matters. I put down a parliamentary question to the Department of Health last week and I have been told I will receive a response from the HSE within 15 days. I was always given to understand that the timeframe was ten days so has there been a change in procedure in that regard?</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">I will do so but I am putting it on the record of the House today. When will we see the consolidated Book of Estimates? Has the revised expenditure benchmark been agreed with the European Commission?</p>]
[<p eid="para_114">There is an issue regarding the workings of the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_116">I will take that on board.</p>]
