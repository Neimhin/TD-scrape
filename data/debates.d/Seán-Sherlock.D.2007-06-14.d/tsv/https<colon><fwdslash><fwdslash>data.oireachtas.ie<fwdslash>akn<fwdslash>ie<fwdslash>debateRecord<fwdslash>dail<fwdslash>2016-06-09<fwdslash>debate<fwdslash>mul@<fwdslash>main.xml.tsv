SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-09T11:20:00+01:00	My first question relates to procedural matters. I put down a parliamentary question to the Department of Health last week and I have been told I will receive a response from the HSE within 15 days. I was always given to understand that the timeframe was ten days so has there been a change in procedure in that regard?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-09T11:20:00+01:00	I will do so but I am putting it on the record of the House today. When will we see the consolidated Book of Estimates? Has the revised expenditure benchmark been agreed with the European Commission?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-09T11:20:00+01:00	There is an issue regarding the workings of the House.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-09T11:20:00+01:00	I will take that on board.
