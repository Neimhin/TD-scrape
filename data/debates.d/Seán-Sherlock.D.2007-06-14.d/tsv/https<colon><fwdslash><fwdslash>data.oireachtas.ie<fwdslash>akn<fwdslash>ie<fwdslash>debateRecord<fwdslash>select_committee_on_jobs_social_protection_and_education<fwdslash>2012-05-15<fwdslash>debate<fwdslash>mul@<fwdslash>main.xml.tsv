SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	In the 12 months since the last Estimates process, we have been engaged in the research prioritisation exercise that was chaired by Mr. Jim O'Hara, formerly of Intel.  We have quite literally stripped down the areas of prioritisation into 14 specific areas.  While I do not believe I need to outline what those areas are, they vary from future networks in communications to innovation in services and business processes.  What we have been seeking to do in the past 12 months is to move into a space whereby there is a closer alignment between academia, through the research component, and industry in order that we can move a new metric into the fray, namely, the effective creation of jobs.  That is what has been informing Government policy in this period.That research prioritisation exercise has given rise to another exercise, the prioritisation action group, which will be chaired by myself.  Its purpose is to look at the 14 areas of focus in the research prioritisation exercise and to drive an agenda to find how we can get that alignment between research and industry in a way that creates the jobs while also seeking to get more accurate measurement of the impact of research, for example, with regard to analysing the spend for research and innovation across various programmes and how we can drive new enterprises and jobs arising from that.  That process is ongoing as we speak.  It is an interdepartmental approach involving all of the funding agencies for research, such as HEA, SFI, Enterprise Ireland and so on.  The group has met twice and is looking at the various themes.  We have already looked at medical devices and food for health and we are now moving into sustainable food production and processing.  We will move through each of the themes individually.We are also moving to create an intellectual property protocol so there is a standardisation across all of the higher education institutes.  If we are creating intellectual property through the higher education system, we need to ensure everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet and there is a clear understanding, because of the various cultures that exist between different academic institutions, of what intellectual property is and how it is mined for a national usage to create those types of companies, innovations and jobs we need to create.  We are on target on the EU programme, framework programme 7.  We have drawn down approximately €360 million and our target is approximately €600 million.  We are on target to reach that.  The next framework is Horizon 2020, which is chaired by our Commissioner, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.  We seek to ensure that from the proposed €85 billion spend we can influence how the calls are made.  There is significant bilateral engagement ongoing currently and we are hopeful that we will reach a higher target than the €600 million already espoused.We are also moving to launch the research centres programme.  In essence, we are trying to see greater consolidation.  We have come from a position where, in the mid 1990s - former Minister, Deputy Martin, rolled out the original programme - we were building capacity through the capital spend and through the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, to now where we are seeking to move the research community with us in a way that ensures that everybody realises we need to create more jobs and that we realise the importance of the FDI infrastructure here.  As the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said already, increasingly more of the investment is predicated on the pre-existing research infrastructure.  It is no longer just about corporate tax anymore, but as much about one's footprint across research, science, technology, innovation and research and development and innovation.  Those metrics and how the Government funds those areas is as important an indicator for inward investment.  What we are trying to do is to create a greater indigenous space of the types of companies that we are funding so that we rebalance the ship in a way that creates more sustainable indigenous Irish companies that can compete on a global scale.  This is a high level overview of where we are currently.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	On the last question, there has been an increase in the number of companies that have taken up innovation vouchers through Enterprise Ireland.  What we are seeking to do is to continue along that vein, but also to encourage smaller businesses, with 50 people or fewer, to engage more with the research infrastructure.  Very often Irish-owned businesses, particularly family businesses, do not move into that space.  These businesses are often in the services sector and do not see any need for interfacing with academia.  However, if they have a relationship with Enterprise Ireland and are creating new innovations, new intellectual property or new types of services, they will have the opportunity to avail of these innovation vouchers.  There were approximately 651 collaborative innovations between industry and third level in 2011, but I do not have the breakdown on these to hand.On the science, technology and innovation side, the chances are that if businesses in the SME sector have a relationship with Enterprise Ireland and are in the scientific or research related field, they will have a relationship with one of the research entities, either the strategic research clusters or the centres for science, engineering and technology.  I hope this addresses the Deputy's point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I want to be satisfied the Deputy is okay with that response.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	There was an increase last year, above the targeted level for 2011.  The output target for 2012 is 610, which is lower than the 2011 figure, but towards the end of last year there was a massive increase.  We must remember it is a demand-led scheme.  With regard to any of the companies employing 50 people or fewer to which I talked, what one seeks to do is to try to encourage them, through Enterprise Ireland, to see whether there is scope within their individual entity for a relationship with the RDI programme, the institutes of technology, UCD, UCC or whatever.  The more of those relationships that are established, the more likely we will, through the innovation voucher system, get some sort of a new process or product which will create the jobs we badly need.On the Patents Office, it was previously included under the administrative subheads, but it now has its own subhead under programme B.  The reduction is accounted for by a reduction in pay.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	It should be processing 100% of patents, but forgive me for not having a direct answer.  It is a demand led provision, so if demand is down, activity will be down.  With regard to the PRTLI, there has been a significant reduction in construction costs on that.  As a result of expenditure cutbacks, we have had to make cuts also.  Instead of having a pro rata cut across the board, we have removed three structural PhD programmes for 2011 and have deferred them.  We will consider them again in the context of the 2013 programme.  I have the titles of the three programmes and can supply them to the Deputy later.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	In my area, where UCC and CIT are based, it is easy for industry to get access to the institutions.  The Rubicon and Nimbus centres are based in CIT and UCC runs the IGNITE programme, which encourages interaction between industry, start-up businesses and the academic institution.  It depends on which way one looks at the case of a small business that wants to innovate.  A company that wants to innovate and create something new will go to the city or county enterprise board or Enterprise Ireland.  Is Deputy Tóibín suggesting the institutes should come out and engage with the business?  The creation of a liaison office is very easy.  I would be very surprised if there is not someone who interacts with business on a daily basis, through Dundalk IT, in the region Deputy Tóibín is talking about.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	It is a very good idea.  Coming from Cork and having an eye to what is happening in the country, I see it in operation throughout the regions on a daily basis.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, it is a mechanism through which county enterprise boards can have an eye on what is happening academically.  We can explore that and I am prepared to talk to Deputy Tóibín about it.  The Department has an open mind on the engagement.  If Deputy Tóibín is saying there is a deficit in the Navan and Meath area, we should examine it to see if an improvement can be made.  This is an apolitical space so the more ideas we have coming from the committee on making the system more beneficial for users, the better.  I freely acknowledge that previous Governments started out on this road and we must give due recognition.  I also give due recognition to the visionary people within the Department, who interface with our agencies every day and play the ground hurling on this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The University of Limerick has the Lero software centre, which is a global leader performing world-class research.  The Government and SFI have invested €16 million in the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre.  The key to such centres is collaboration.  Its partners include DCU, Dundalk IT, NUIG, TCD, UCD and UL.  There is also an interface with the industry.  The SFI CSET award is augmented to the tune of €6.4 million by IBM Ireland, Intel, QAD, Kugler Maag CIE and Movidious.  That is the system we are trying to ensure works.The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre considers themes such as water management, smart cities, transport infrastructure and ensures output will be influenced by academic pursuits, industry and societal needs.  I refer to smart cities and the issue of water which is very prevalent.  The smart use of water and the application of technological advances to the delivery of water and using Lero, the Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, as an example, there is a societal or beneficial outcome which will ultimately benefit the economy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I may not have fully answered Deputy Toíbín's question.  Three more research centres are planned and I apologise if I did not state this in my initial reply.  One centre is for cloud computing and €1.2 million funding was announced by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in April.  There is provision for the learning technologies centre to be established in June this year.  It is hoped the financial services centre will also be established this year but some background work still remains to be done.  Enterprise Ireland is working on a structure for regional gateways.  To be helpful to the Deputy, I suggest he might engage with Enterprise Ireland with regard to his own specific area.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The European Space Agency is a hardy perennial.  Approximately 22 Irish companies and at least 12 research groups are involved in space-related activities.  In terms of our investment of €14.779 million in the agency, research carried out in 2008 showed that the financial investment to the economy of our investment of approximately €13.5 million in the agency in 2007 was approximately €21 million in foreign investment.  In a recent survey of 30 companies involved with the European Space Agency there were 19 respondents which reported growth increased in value terms from €51 million in 2008 to €71 million in 2010 and they project it will increase by up to €168 million by 2014.I can name two companies in this area with which I am familiar, Radisens Diagnostics and TreeMetrics.  They are both start-up companies effectively, but Radisens Diagnostics is funded by the European Space Agency.  It develops a point-of-care bloodtesting device and it will be used in the International Space Station.  The fact that its diagnostic device is being used in the final frontier has a beneficial impact because if it is rubber-stamped up there, the company will see a massive growth in its sales potential.  It will benefit from the kudos attached to the use of its device there.  While I would have been among the sceptics in questioning the value of our membership at the beginning, there is a qualitative impact from the spend of approximately €14.7 million in terms of the number of jobs it creates.  The number employed in Radisens Diagnostics will increase from 13 to approximately 35 in 2013.  One can imagine the impact on the economy of the creation of 35 jobs.  I, our Department and the Government believe that the spend is worth it because there is a return to the domestic economy.TreeMetrics is in the business of forest inventory management and it is developing new overseas markets.  As a result of it getting a grant from the European Space Agency, it projects the number it will employ in 2012 will be €16 million or 16 people.  It also works with Coillte.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The members are all still awake at this stage.  The net point is that while membership of the European Space Agency might seem to be something that is quite esoteric and one might wonder why we should invest in it, the proof of the pudding is that it is generating jobs in the Irish economy.  It is helping Irish companies to grow their businesses, their output is increasing in monetary terms, and they are creating new jobs.  That is the bottom line.  We have to go by the 2007 figures, which are the latest ones I have available.  For a spend of €13.5 million in 2007, we had a return of €21 million.  Those are the most recent figures I have but we will try to get more up-to-date figures.
