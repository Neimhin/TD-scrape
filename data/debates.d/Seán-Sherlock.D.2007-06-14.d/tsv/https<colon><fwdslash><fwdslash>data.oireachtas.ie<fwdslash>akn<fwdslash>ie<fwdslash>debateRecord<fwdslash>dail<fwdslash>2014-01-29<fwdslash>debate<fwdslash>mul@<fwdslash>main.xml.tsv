SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-01-29T11:10:00+00:00	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I welcome this opportunity to present the Industrial Development (Forfás Dissolution) Bill 2013 to Dáil Éireann. The Bill was published on 23 December 2013. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the decision to integrate the research and policy advisory functions of Forfás into the Department. As part of the public service reform plan, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, undertook to review how the functions currently carried out by Forfás might be integrated with the resources of my Department in order to further enhance the formulation and implementation of national enterprise policy. Following consideration of the matter and engagement with the board of Forfás, the Minister decided, in May 2012, to proceed with the proposed integration. This move forms part of a broader reform programme which we have been progressing across the Department and its agencies, including the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority; the reform of the five workplace relations bodies into two organisations; restructuring the enterprise support model for micro and small businesses, including the dissolution of the 35 CEBs and the creation of the new local enterprise offices; and restructuring transport and enterprise development bodies in the Shannon region. The overarching objective of integrating Forfás into the Department is to strengthen our capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. We envisage improved outcomes in enhancing the operating environment for enterprise and contributing to economic growth and job creation.A key objective is to ensure the distinct strengths and experience of the Department's staff and those of Forfás are maximised to place the Department at the centre of driving economic recovery. Since its establishment in 1994, Forfás has played a significant role in providing independent policy advice and research analysis to the Minister and Department and a key role in progressing the enterprise agenda and facilitating the development of our modern economy. In the past three years, the agency has become increasingly involved in the central policy making process in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, playing a leading role in the preparation of the annual Action Plan for Jobs. At this juncture, it is considered that combining the resources of Forfás and the Department represents the optimum use of scarce resources, particularly against a backdrop of significant reductions in staffing levels arising from the need to reduce the public sector pay bill. Forfás was established in 1994 under the Industrial Development Act 1993 as an agency of the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Its core functions are to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development of industry; encourage the development of industry and technology; advise on the development and co-ordination of policies across the development agencies supporting enterprise; provide independent research in the areas of enterprise and science policy; evaluate enterprise policy interventions; and provide research and administrative support to a number of independent advisory groups, including the National Competitiveness Council, Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Advisory Council for Science,Technology and Innovation. Under the Industrial Development Act 1993 and related legislation, Forfás is statutorily the employer of staff in IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland as well as some staff in the National Standards Authority of Ireland. The agency also has responsibility for pensions of enterprise agency staff and employees of a number of former agencies, including the Industrial Development Authority, Eolas, the National Board for Science and Technology, the Irish Goods Council and An Bord Trachtálá. Forfás also carries out a range of shared services on behalf of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and, in particular, Science Foundation Ireland, including the administration of pensions, property management and other central functions. The Irish National Accreditation Board operates as a committee of Forfás and is supported by Forfás staff. It is proposed that the core policy advisory and research functions of Forfás will be incorporated into a new strategic policy division to be established within the Department. The new division will be tasked with a significant range of policy evaluation, co-ordination and planning activities on behalf of the Minister and for the Department's agencies. The key elements of the role of the new division will be in the areas of enterprise policy; competitiveness; horizon scanning; tax policy; the Action Plan for Jobs; trade and innovation policies; education, skills and labour market analysis; and key policy surveys and research. The staff of Forfás who are currently engaged in delivering these functions will transfer into the division within the Department together with relevant support staff from the agency. The capacity to bring forward independent, evidence based, policy recommendations to Ministers and Government is an essential requirement for economic development. Since its establishment, Forfás has provided robust and independent analysis and advice which has greatly assisted the Department and others to formulate policy positions. The Department remains committed, through the new strategic policy division, to ensuring policy advice to Ministers is informed by a robust evidence base and through consultation with relevant stakeholders. Forfás also provides research and administrative support to a number of independent advisory groups, including the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, and Expert Group on Future Skills Needs. As these bodies are an integral component of the overall enterprise agenda, the strategic policy division will continue to provide them with support and secretariat services. The National Competitiveness Council reports to the Minister on key competitiveness issues facing the economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance our competitive position. The council is supported in its work by Forfás which monitors Ireland's competitiveness on an ongoing basis. The role of the National Competitiveness Council in the context of the Forfás integration has been carefully considered. The council's membership has been expanded to incorporate the industry partners appointed to assist with "disruptive reforms" under the Action Plan for Jobs and broaden the range of Departments attending National Competitiveness Council meetings in an advisory capacity. The Government has approved revised terms of reference for the NCC to give it greater flexibility to prepare and publish reports on issues it considers important, thereby copper-fastening its independence within the new organisational structure. The revised terms of reference also provide for a specific role for the council in respect of preparation of the competitiveness chapter of the Action Plan for Jobs. The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs reports jointly to the Minister and Minister for Education and Skills. It will continue to prepare policy papers independently on skills needs and labour market issues which impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth and will be serviced by the strategic policy division. The current membership of the Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation has been stood down, with effect from 25 September 2013, pending the finalisation of the Forfás integration process and overall policy on public service reform. This does not rule out the option of establishing an advisory council of a similar nature on an alternative footing if this is deemed appropriate at some stage in the future. In addition, Forfás undertakes a number of surveys including the annual employment survey, which tracks employment in enterprise agency supported companies, and the annual survey of business impacts, which measures expenditure by agency supported companies in the economy. These surveys play an important role in helping to evaluate the performance of the enterprise agencies and will continue as part of the work of the strategic policy division. Forfás inherited a range of functions and powers on its establishment, originating in the Industrial Research and Standards Act 1961, Industrial Development Act 1986 and Science and Technology Act 1987. The establishing legislation mandated Forfás to assign these powers to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. These powers will now be vested directly in these agencies. The Bill, in section 36, also makes an amendment to the IDA's existing functions. Section 8(d) of the Industrial Development Act 1993 makes provision for IDA Ireland to administer schemes requiring the disbursement exclusively of European Union funds. It is proposed to amend this section to give the IDA the same power as was provided to Enterprise Ireland by section 7(1) of the Industrial Development Act 1998, which allows Enterprise Ireland "to administer such schemes, grants and other financial facilities requiring the disbursement of European Union funds and such other funds as may from time to time be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance". The provision in the 1993 Act is considered to be restrictive on the IDA and the amendment will allow the agency to administer schemes which include the disbursement of Exchequer funds, as may be authorised by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Previously, the IDA was not in a position to administer schemes such as the employment subsidy scheme which was managed exclusively by Enterprise Ireland, even though the scheme was open to IDA client companies. The non-policy functions which Forfás carries out on behalf of other agencies will be transferred into the Department or to other agencies under the remit of the Department, as appropriate, together with the relevant staff resources. The property management function of Forfás and associated staff transferred to IDA Ireland in July 2013. The legislation provides for Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland to become employers in their own right and for each agency to establish a superannuation scheme for its employees.Currently, Forfás is the legal employer of all staff working in Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. These staff are seconded from Forfás to their respective agencies. This legislation provides for staff seconded from Forfás to become staff of their respective agencies. Forfás is also the legal employer of a number of staff working in the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, and this legislation provides for these staff to become staff of the NSAI. Employees of each of the agencies will become members of their agency's superannuation scheme, as appropriate. The legislation provides for responsibility for all existing pensioners, and those with deferred benefits for whom Forfás currently has responsibility, to transfer to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, is the national body with responsibility for the accreditation of laboratories, certification bodies and inspection bodies. Accreditation is the procedure by which an authoritative body gives formal recognition that a body or person is competent to carry out specific tasks. EU member states have established a network of national accreditation bodies to ensure the competence of all laboratories, inspection and certification bodies are assessed against the same principles. Accreditation plays an important role in guaranteeing the access of Irish products and services to EU and worldwide markets. The demand for accreditation has increased significantly in recent times as national regulators continue to rely on conformity assessment as a mechanism to support the implementation of legislation and assure competence. Responsibility for accreditation in Ireland is currently vested in Forfás. In practice, the accreditation function is delegated to the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, which is a committee of Forfás, supported by Forfás staff in the administration of its functions. The accreditation functions of Forfás will be transferred to the Health and Safety Authority with INAB to be established as a committee of the authority. This mirrors the current arrangements that apply to INAB within Forfás. The Bill provides for the transfer of the accreditation functions and associated staff of Forfás to the Health and Safety Authority by amendment of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. As outlined, the purpose of integrating Forfás into the Department is to strengthen the Department's capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The proposal is not driven by the objective of finding cost savings, although some savings may arise in due course if synergies between the two organisations are identified. It is not envisaged that any reduction in staff numbers will arise as a result of the integration. There may be some costs associated with, for example, the reconciliation of IT systems arising from these proposals. However, any such costs will be met from existing resources. Overall, the integration of Forfás into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will facilitate improvements in the use and effectiveness of existing resources. I will briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.
Section 1
sets out the Short Title and empowers the Minister to appoint, by ministerial order, the day on which sections of the Bill will commence. This Act, other than Part 7, will be included in the collective citation of Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 2013. Part 7 relates to the transfer of INAB and its accreditation functions to the Health and Safety Authority. The Bill provides that Part 7 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 to 2010 may be cited together as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Acts 2005 to 2013.
Section
2 sets out a number of definitions relating to specific terms used in the body of the Bill. Section
3 provides that any expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 4
sets out the Acts or parts of Acts to be repealed on the enactment of this Bill. There are a number of other repeals relating to commencement orders in earlier Acts, which are included in Parts 2 to 5 of this Bill, under the provisions relating to staff of the various agencies. Section
5 provides for Enterprise Ireland and subsidiaries of Enterprise Ireland to employ staff subject to the consent of the Minister and the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Section 6 provides for the transfer to Enterprise Ireland of staff currently seconded from Forfás on terms and conditions of service relating to remuneration which are no less favourable than those applying before the transfer. Section
7 provides for Enterprise Ireland to establish a superannuation scheme in respect of persons referred to in section 6, as appropriate. Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, replicate the provisions of sections 5 to 7, inclusive, in respect of staff of IDA Ireland. Sections 11 to 13, inclusive, replicate the provisions of sections 5 to 7, inclusive, in respect of staff of Science Foundation Ireland. Section 14
provides for Forfás staff seconded to, or working under the direction of, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, to transfer to the NSAI on terms and conditions of service relating to remuneration and superannuation, no less favourable than those applying before the transfer. Section 14(1)(a) relates to staff of the Legal Metrology Service which operated within Forbairt until its dissolution in 1998. The Legal Metrology Service was transferred to the NSAI by section 50 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, and its staff became members of the staff of Forfás, who were then seconded to the NSAI. Section 14(1)(b) refers to Forfás staff who were working in NSAI under the provisions of section 38 of the National Standards Authority or Ireland Act 1996, which provided for these staff to continue to be Forfás staff. The NSAI had previously operated as a division of Forfás prior to the establishment in 1996 of the standards authority.
Section 15
defines "relevant person", as used in various sections in relation to Forfás functions being transferred to other bodies. Section 16
provides for the dissolution of Forfás on a day to be appointed by the Minister. Section 17
provides that references in any enactment to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or SFI as an agency of Forfás shall be construed as a reference to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or SFI, as appropriate.
Section 18 provides for the transfer of functions currently vested in Forfás to Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as appropriate in accordance with the Schedule to the Bill. Section 19
provides for the transfer of functions currently vested in Forfás, other than those referred to in sections 18 and 28, to be transferred to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Section 20
provides for any liability or loss arising out of the performance of the functions of Forfás before the dissolution day to rest with the relevant person as defined in section 15 - in effect, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the Minister - and not against the dissolved body, Forfás.
Section 21
provides that all property vested in Forfás immediately before the dissolution day will transfer to the Minister on that day. Section 22 provides that all rights and liabilities of Forfás will transfer to the Minister on the dissolution day. Section 23 provides that anything commenced but not completed before the dissolution day under the authority of Forfás in so far as it relates to a function transferred to a relevant person under this Act shall be carried on or completed by a relevant person. Subsection (3) provides that references to Forfás in the memorandum or articles of association of any company which relate to a function transferred to a relevant body under this Act shall be taken as a reference to the relevant body. Subsection (4) provides that any money, stocks, shares or securities transferred to the Minister that were held by Forfás before dissolution day shall be transferred into the name of the Minister.
Section 24
provides that the staff of Forfás, other than those who are transferring to become employees of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, SFI, NSAI or the HSA, will be appointed to an unestablished position in the Civil Service on terms and conditions of service relating to remuneration and superannuation no less favourable than those applying before the transfer. These staff will subsequently be designated as established civil servants. Section 25 provides that superannuation schemes administered by Forfás prior to dissolution shall continue in force as if made by the Minister. Section 26 provides for the preparation of final accounts for Forfás no later than one year after the dissolution date and for the preparation of a final annual report within six months of dissolution. Part 7 relates to accreditation. The functions of accreditation are vested in Forfás and undertaken by the Irish National Accreditation Board, which currently operates as a committee of Forfás supported by dedicated Forfás staff. INAB accreditation functions and related staff will transfer from Forfás to the Health and Safety Authority. This requires amendments to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Section 27 sets out several definitions relating to the accreditation function which are to be included in section 2 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Section 28 inserts a new section 33A into the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, transferring the powers and functions of Forfás relating to accreditation to the Health and Safety Authority. Section 29 provides for the HSA to carry out accreditation in accordance with the powers and functions transferred by section 28 and in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 765/2008 in so far as it relates to accreditation. Section 30 provides for transfer of relevant Forfás staff to the HSA, by inserting a new section 54A after section 54 of the 2005 Act, on terms and conditions of service relating to remuneration and superannuation no less favourable than those applying before the transfer. Section 31 provides for an amendment to Part 5 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 by adding a new Chapter 3 and adding several new sections 56A-56I. Section 56A of the 2005 Act provides for the committee established by the board of Forfás, known as the Irish National Accreditation Board, to become a committee of the authority. It sets out operational procedures for the INAB. Section 56B provides for the transfer by Forfás to the HSA of any property related to the accreditation function. Section 56C provides for the transfer of rights and liabilities arising from the accreditation role to be transferred from Forfás to the HSA. Section 56D provides that any claim in respect of loss or injury suffered by any person arising out of the performance by Forfás of the accreditation functions before the enactment of this section shall lie against the HSA. Section 56E provides that anything commenced but not completed before the coming into operation of this section by or on behalf of Forfás in so far as it relates to a function transferred by section 29 shall be carried on or completed by the HSA. Section 56E(2) provides that any money, stocks, shares or securities transferred by section 56B that are held by Forfás shall be transferred to the authority. Section 56F provides that records held by Forfás relating to the accreditation function will be transferred to the HSA on the coming into operation of this section. Section 56G provides for the HSA to establish an appeals board and related matters. Section 56H sets out the procedures relating to the making of an appeal against a decision of the accreditation board or the failure of the accreditation board to make a decision. Section 56I provides for disclosure of interests by members of the accreditation board. Section 32 amends section 47 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and relates to the HSA setting fees for accreditation and entering into contracts for the purposes of accreditation functions. Section 33 amends section 73 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and relates to prohibition on disclosures by providing for inclusion of members of the accreditation board and the appeals board in that section. Section 34 amends section 77 of the 2005 Act, which sets out a range of offences relating to various provisions under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. The purpose of the amendment is to exclude matters relating to accreditation from automatically being a prosecutable offence under section 77 of the 2005 Act. Where an offence might be committed relating to accreditation, it would be open to be pursued through normal legal channels. Section 35 inserts a new Schedule to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, providing for the Irish National Accreditation Board and associated procedural matters. Part 8, section 36 amends section 8 of the Industrial Development Act 1993 to allow IDA Ireland to administer schemes and disburse such Exchequer funds as may be authorised by the Minister. The existing section 8(d) of the Industrial Development Act 1993 makes provision for IDA to administer schemes requiring the disbursement exclusively of EU funds and this amendment will give IDA the same powers as Enterprise Ireland and enable IDA to administer schemes such as the recent employment subsidy scheme, which was managed solely by Enterprise Ireland although the scheme was open to IDA client companies. Section 9B of the 1993 Act, as inserted by the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Act 2013, is to be repealed and replaced with a new section 9B relating to the supply of information to the Minister rather than to Forfás. Paragraph 8(2) of the First Schedule of the 1993 Act is substituted with a new paragraph 8(2), providing for committees established by IDA to supply IDA with information for the purposes of its functions rather than to Forfás.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-29T11:40:00+00:00	I thank the House for its indulgence. This is a rather technical Bill but I am nearly there. Section 37 substitutes a new section 6 into the Industrial Development Act 1995, providing for IDA and Enterprise Ireland to invest or make loans in accordance with schemes drawn up by the agencies and approved by the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This function was previously vested in Forfás and assigned to the agencies. Section 38 provides that schemes which were in force prior to the coming into force of the amendment inserted by section 37 will continue in force as if the scheme had been made under the provision of the new section, that is, section 6 of the Industrial Development Act 1995, as amended. Section 39 amends section 7 of the Metrology Act 1996 to provide that the director of legal metrology shall be a staff member of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. At present, this section states that the director of legal metrology shall be a member of the staff of Forfás. Section 40(a) amends section 7(k) of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998 which relates to the functions of Enterprise Ireland and provides for the Minister to assign other functions to the agency from time to time. Section 40(b) substitutes a new section 42 into the 1998 Act, allowing Enterprise Ireland and IDA to prosecute summary offences relating to disclosure of information. Section 41(a) amends section 7(1) of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Act 2003 relating to the functions of Science Foundation Ireland and provides for the Minister to assign other functions to the agency from time to time. Section 41(b) amends section 17 of the 2003 Act providing for Science Foundation Ireland to bring and prosecute proceedings relating to disclosures. Section 41(c) amends section 25 of the 2003 Act by the substitution of section 25(2), providing for committees established by the SFI to supply SFI with information for the purposes of its functions. I emphasise that the overarching objective of the Bill is to strengthen our capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy. The integration of Forfás into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will deliver greater outcomes in terms of improving the operating environment for enterprise and contributing to economic growth and job creation. It will ensure that the distinct strengths and experience of the Department's staff and those of Forfás are maximised to place the Department at the centre of driving economic recovery.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-29T16:20:00+00:00	What is the Deputy talking about?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-29T16:20:00+00:00	Which two?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-29T16:20:00+00:00	Is it pertinent to this Bill?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-01-29T16:20:00+00:00	With all due respect, I do not follow the Deputy's point.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-01-29T16:30:00+00:00	As there are 15 or so minutes left in the Deputy's slot, I thank him for his latitude. It is my intention to address only those points that were pertinent to the Bill. Some political points were made, as were a number that were extraneous to the Bill. I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions. I will address a number of the issues raised by Deputy Calleary. I welcome his support for the Bill. His praise for the valuable work done by Forfás since its establishment is well deserved. Forfás is one of those organisations that enjoys the confidence of the polity. As a Minister of State, I have witnessed at first hand the expertise and excellence of its people. Their commitment to public service is unfailing. Bringing the policy capability of Forfás into the Department will give the latter the opportunity to strengthen its ability to shape and implement policy and to oversee the performance of its agencies. Forfás has made a significant contribution to the economy's transformation of recent years, a point that has been made across the political divide. It has been of significant value to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Government in the development of appropriate policy responses to the many enterprise development challenges confronting us. Forfás has provided robust and independent analysis and advice that has assisted my Department and others in formulating policy positions to drive the policy agenda. This speaks to some of the points made by various Deputies concerning independence. The independent nature of the research and advice that Forfás provides is of great value to the Department. It is not intended that this independent thinking will be diminished by the integration process. Forfás's policy and research functions will form the core of the new strategic policy division in the Department. Co-locating Forfás in the Department will streamline the process between policy development and its implementation, serving to strengthen the Department's role in driving economic recovery. Regardless of whether Deputies were speaking for their own constituencies, everyone who contributed to this debate discussed economic recovery in one way or another and the need to drive the jobs agenda. At its core, Forfás will work in the Department with a view to growing jobs and economic recovery. I assure the House that our objective is to maintain the independence that we have come to expect from Forfás's research and analysis. There are precedents in the Civil Service for this type of independent work being conducted within a Department. When Ireland was a recipient of significant structural funds in the 1990s, a number of evaluation units were established in the lead Departments responsible for the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European agricultural funds. Although primarily staffed by civil servants, these units independently evaluated individual programmes and published their reports. A central evaluation unit was later established in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and published its reports. The senior management teams of my Department and Forfás are committed to ensuring that the integration is operationalised in a way that maximises the outcomes in terms of developing and implementing enterprise policy. We are also committed to ensuring that policy advice to other Ministers continues to be informed by robust, evidence-based analysis and through consultation with relevant stakeholders through the strategic policy division. The capacity of Forfás to support independent advice and analysis will also be maintained through its support for the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, EGFSN. The role of the NCC in the context of the Forfás integration has been carefully considered. Revised terms of reference have been approved for the NCC, which will give it greater flexibility to prepare and publish reports on issues it considers important, thereby copper-fastening its independence. I hope that this addresses the concerns expressed by Deputies in this regard. The EGFSN, which reports jointly to the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills, will continue preparing policy papers independently on skills needs and labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth. The EGFSN will also be serviced by the strategic policy division. Deputy Calleary referred to a figure of €11 million in respect of the Forfás research budget in 2013. The Forfás research and studies consultancy budget in 2013 was actually €990,000. There was a further allocation of €125,000 for specialised and professional services, giving a total of approximately €1.1 million. If Deputy Calleary wants to provide us with the source of his figures, we will seek to clarify them for him. While the Forfás research and consultancy budget has been incorporated into my Department's budget for 2014, the Minister and the Department are committed to ensuring that the strategic policy division is properly resourced in this regard. There is no intention to reduce the budget in future years. Deputy Calleary also raised the issue of Carrisbrook House. Upon the re-organisation of the enterprise development agencies in 1994, Forfás acquired responsibility for the leasehold interests, maintenance and repair of the former IDA headquarters, Carrisbrook House. Forfás managed the buildings until July 2013, when responsibility for the management of the leases and property transferred to IDA Ireland as part of progressing the integration of Forfás with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Carrisbrook House was originally acquired by AnCO in 1969 on a 65-year full repairing lease. It was one of the Dublin offices occupied by the former IDA up to 1985 when the IDA centralised in Wilton Park House. Since then, Carrisbrook House has been sublet to a number of tenants and was fully sublet by Forfás to the middle of 2008.Approximately 15% of the building is sublet to an embassy and the remainder of the building is unoccupied, but is being actively marketed to potential new tenants. However, the vacating of the space in question coincided with the economic downturn. Every effort has been made by Forfás to seek replacement tenants or to dispose of the leasehold interest. Working with professional estate agents, a number of marketing initiatives were undertaken since 2008. Forfás has also worked with IDA Ireland in marketing the property for potential tenants. In 2011 and 2012, Forfás stepped up direct marketing and during this time there were 12 viewings of the building. In the context of difficult market conditions, and despite a number of engagements with potential tenants, a letting has not been secured. The IDA has now assumed responsibility for all properties formerly managed by Forfás and will continue the efforts to secure tenants for Carrisbrook House. The cost of the vacant space in Carrisbrook House was approximately €1.2 million for 2012. It is hoped that as the economy continues to recover and as demand for commercial premises continues to rise, in particular in Dublin, IDA Ireland will be successful in filling the vacant office space in Carrisbrook House. Deputy Calleary also asked this morning about the Advisory Council on Science, Technology and Innovation, which is supported by Forfás staff. The current membership of the advisory council was stood down with effect from 25 September 2013, pending the finalisation of the Forfás integration process and overall policy on public service reform. This does not rule out the option of establishing an advisory council of a similar nature on an alternative footing if this is deemed appropriate at some stage in the future. There have been many developments in the research and technology agenda over the past two years. The report of the research prioritisation group was published. We have 14 priority areas arising from that report, giving rise to 14 action plans. Forfás plays an integral part in that process. If it was not for Forfás, it would not be as successful a process, such is the good work it carries out. The process will form the main pillar of our research strategy up to 2017. Deputies might say that I would say that anyway, as Minister of State with responsibility for research, but it is very pertinent to my brief. A Deputy raised the issue of pensions. A substantial portion of the Forfás non-pay budget for 2014 has been subsumed into the Department's budget to reflect progress to date on the integration project. It is important to state that Forfás also has responsibility for the pension costs of retired staff of Forfás, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and certain former agencies, such as An Bord Tráchtála, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the National Board for Science and Technology and Eolas, under the Industrial Development Acts 1993 to 2003. As legal employer of 1,150 staff across the development agencies, Forfás centrally manages the pension schemes of Forfás itself and its preceding organisations, the associated pension compliance obligations and related staff benefits and insurance scheme. I hope that goes towards answering the points made about the outturns for 2013 and 2014 in respect of pensions. There are 32 staff and two heads of division to be assigned to the strategic policy division. That question was asked in respect of staffing. Deputy Broughan made a number of points, one of which was about social enterprise. That is not pertinent to this Bill, but there is an interdepartmental group on social enterprise which meets me and the social enterprise task force on a regular basis. If there is an issue with the potential of social economy and community enterprise in north Dublin, the Deputy can contact me and we can facilitate a further discussion on that. Deputy Broughan also raised the issue of the costs of relocating the functions. There are no additional costs associated with the transfer of functions, and Deputy McGrath raised this point as well. The Forfás property function has been transferred to IDA Ireland, along with some shared services functions. Existing budgets in respect of these functions transferred to the IDA and there is no proposal to increase these budgets. There may be some costs associated with the relocation of INAB to the HSA, but these will be relatively small and will be met from within existing budgets. I hope I have answered Deputy O'Brien's point about independent and critical analysis. We all agree that the commitment is there. It is important that the independence be maintained and that the body would have that ability to construct its own reports. There were also issues about unemployment and youth unemployment. I do not intend getting into a macroeconomic debate. There are other mechanisms for addressing those political points that were made. Points were also made about IDA regional development. Specific Deputies made points about their own constituencies. IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are revising their regional strategies which will seek to overcome and address problems which may be hampering regional development. I know the IDA recently announced plans to provide offices and buildings in a number of regional locations in the coming years. It is fair to say IDA Ireland actively promotes centres throughout the country, but in my experience, if we look at those companies coming in now, particularly in the technology sector, they are often young companies born on the Internet and they seem to want to cluster in areas where there is already much activity, such as Dublin and larger urban conurbations like Cork and Limerick. They are not inclined to move outside those larger urban conurbations, so there is no doubt that this provides a challenge. Very often the client companies make the ultimate decision on where to locate, following site visits. It is important to recognise that as well. There is no doubt there is still a regional disparity and a challenge in respect of the growth in the eastern side of the country relative to other regional areas. That is something we are addressing through Action Plan for Jobs. The implementation team tasked with overseeing the integration of Forfás into the Department has made considerable progress ahead of the legislation to dissolve Forfás in agreeing with the relevant agencies the most appropriate location for Forfás's non-policy functions. Once the legislation is enacted, we will be ready to commence Parts 2 to 5, inclusive, and section 39, all of which relate to the staff of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the NSAI, in advance of the dissolution of Forfás. More than 1,000 employees currently seconded from Forfás will become employees of their respective agency once these parts are commenced. Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland will set up individual superannuation schemes for their employees who will leave the existing Forfás and legacy schemes to join these schemes, retaining their respective terms and conditions from their previous superannuation schemes. Therefore, there is no diminution of standards in that sense. We will also commence Part 7 at the same time, which provides for the transfer of the accreditation function and associated staff from Forfás to the HSA in advance of the dissolution date. These staff will join the HSA superannuation scheme, retaining their respective terms and conditions from their previous superannuation schemes. Part 6, which provides for the dissolution of Forfás and the transfer of its functions to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the Minister, as appropriate, as well as the remaining sections of Part 8, will be commenced on the dissolution date, which is to be decided. Decisions have been taken with regard to the reformed structure of the Department once Forfás has been integrated and project teams are working on the practical aspects of the transfer of Forfás staff, records and ICT systems to the Department. We anticipate, therefore, that the dissolution of the agency, integration of its policy and research functions and transfer of approximately 60 staff will take place shortly after the commencement of the Parts relating to the various agencies.  I thank Deputies for their contributions on the Bill. I deliberately did not address issues raised that were not pertinent to the legislation. Deputies - I am guilty too in this regard - have a tendency to take advantage of Second Stage debates to introduce matters which are extraneous to the legislation being debated.  While the Bill is technical in nature, it is important legislation which will give effect to the decision to integrate the policy and research functions of Forfás in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It is a valuable part of the Department's contribution to the public sector reform plan. Combining the strengths of the Department and Forfás will help us in our efforts to be a world class enterprise Ministry and enhance the contribution the Department makes to economic recovery. Deputies share in this aspiration to create jobs and generate a sustainable economic recovery that will have a positive impact on society. Forfás, through its staff, will have a major role to play in this regard.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-01-29T16:50:00+00:00	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(a) and (6)(a) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.
