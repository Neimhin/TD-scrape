SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to nail the lie that the universal social charge is a charge.  It is in fact a tax and let us call it what it is.  Financial Resolution No. 13 on which we voted on Tuesday stated:THAT, with effect from 1 January 2011, there shall be charged, levied and paid, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution, a tax to be known as "universal social charge" in respect of the income specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the Table to this paragraph.So it is a tax and that tax is a time bomb that will seriously affect low-income earners with serious medical conditions who have medical cards and are exempted from the other levies.  The grouping together of the health and income levies under this universal social charge — that is, universal social tax — will mean that such people will now not be exempted from these levies, will be subjected to this tax and will have their already meagre and marginal incomes reduced further by the imposition of this tax.  It is completely and utterly regressive.  I find myself saying the same thing this year as I did in the debate on last year's budget; any principle of taxation must be such that it is meted out fairly and in an equitable fashion.  This runs contrary to the canons of taxation because it will affect those people on marginal incomes who also have serious underlying medical conditions in an adverse way by virtue of its imposition.  It is completely unfair and should be opposed.  I stand proud that our party will oppose the imposition of this tax because it is not what we are about in this Republic and any country with proper republican ideals would not impose such a tax in such a way as to affect those people who are on such marginal incomes.The Union of Students of Ireland provided a very good critique of Tuesday's budget and highlighted that the budget seeks to double the distance required to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of third level grant from 24 km to 45 km for all existing and new applicants from September 2011.  The net effect is that it will exclude working-class families from the potential to gain a grant.  It will exclude people living in rural areas from being able to get a third level grant and will act as a disincentive for people who want to upskill and come back into the educational sphere if they happen to be living such distances away from the third level institution they want to attend, which is also ludicrous.  If we are seeking to get people back to work, arbitrary bands such as this discriminate against those who will not qualify on the basis of distance.Carers are protecting vulnerable people and allowing them to live independently within the family home but subject to help from those who are caring for them.  Why has the Government created a further disincentive for anybody to take up a carer's allowance when the net impact could be to force more people into nursing homes?  There is a social economy and we need to take a more lateral view by regarding care givers as people who are making an active contribution and who should get a due reward for that contribution to avoid forcing people into nursing homes because of the disincentive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Deputy Ó Snodaigh might relay that to his colleagues.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are interested in the substantive issues.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to speak about social assistance schemes and, specifically, the farm assist payment.  The rate of payment has been reduced from €196 to €188 per person.  The qualified adult dependant allowance goes from €130 down to €124.80.I speak for people on farm assist because they are farming very small holdings and live, for the most part, in remote rural settings.  I am talking about parts of south Kerry, Connemara and Sligo and Donegal in the north west.  They often farm marginal land.  The fact that they are receiving the farm assist payment is proof that their incomes from farming are meagre.  These people will now suffer from the reduction in the rate of farm assist.  They will also be subject to increased charges to get their children to primary and secondary schools.  These families take the bus because do not have their own transport.  They will also be subject to the new universal social charge.  Their farm income will bring them into the social charge band.  While they may have been exempt from levies in the past, they are now being brought into the tax net.  The universal social charge is not a charge.  It is a form of taxation.  These people will suffer from the cut in social welfare rates but also because the Government has developed this inequitable social charge.We must speak for these people.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil no longer speaks for the marginalised people who live in rural areas.  The message sent by the budget to these people is that they may have voted for Fianna Fáil all their lives but they, and their votes, will now be taken for granted.  However, I can see from the number of calls I have received from people who are adversely affected by this budget that they are beginning to change their minds.  No longer can one fool these people with false promises or take from them in a disproportionate fashion.A millionaire makes a net gain from this budget while a person making a marginal income from a small farm makes a loss.  A family with a child in university will be further caught by the new adjacency ruling for third level grant qualification.  Why does the Government need to make these cuts?  There is no level of equity in them.  The person who shaped this budget cannot have thought laterally about how it would affect people on the margins.In spite of our political differences, we were always a nation of people who sought to look after our most vulnerable.  This universal social charge is grossly unfair.  In normal times, we might have accepted the need to reduce payments for farm assist, for example.  However, the universal social charge adds a further financial penalty for those people who are living on the margins.The same is true of the cuts in carer's allowances and in other rates.  Why must we consistently attack these people?  There is no logical explanation for it.  It is a disproportionate cut and is contrary to the canons of taxation.  One is supposed to levy tax in an equitable fashion but that has not been done in this case.  I accept that we are discussing the Social Welfare Bill, but taxation is pertinent to the argument.  People who are earning money and are also in receipt of social welfare will suffer a double whammy because they will come into the net of the universal social charge as well as suffering a reduced rate of social welfare.  I had a call today from someone who has a very marginal income and is dependent on a medical card, because of a genuine underlying medical condition.  The person had an exemption from the levies but will not be exempt from the new charge.  I have sought advice from colleagues as to whether such a person, despite the fact that the household has an income, should apply to the community welfare officer for a home heating grant in the coming months.We should ensure that households with a marginal income are not penalised further.  These people may be in their 30s and 40s and still making large mortgage repayments, which eats up a large part of their disposable incomes.  Imposing charges of this nature on those people could tip them over the edge and force them to rely on community welfare officers or supplementary welfare payments in order to sustain life and limb.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We must think more laterally in proposing budgets.  We accept that there had to be cuts across the board.  We were bought into the idea that there would be adjustments.  However, in a proper society one cannot disproportionately affect people who are already marginalised.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Are we not entitled to rise to our feet?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Ferris.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will share time equally with the Deputy.If I understood the Minister correctly, bank bonuses will be taxed at a rate of 90%.  I have not been informed as to the number of employees who will benefit from bonuses.  If, however, 90 employees of the banks which come under the guarantee were to benefit from a bonus of €40 million, each of them would receive €444,444.  If a tax rate of 90% was applied to this figure, they would each receive a net payment of approximately €44,400.  Any type of spin which seeks to dissipate the effect of paying these bonuses will not work because the beneficiaries will still receive significant sums of taxpayers' money.  An underhand approach has been taken and the legislation needs to be revisited in this regard.It is immoral that bonuses should be paid to fat cats when those on the minimum wage are countenancing a cut in their income.  Some 6,000 signatures of people opposing the cut were gathered in the past 24 hours by the Migrants Centre of Ireland whose members campaigned outside the gates of the House today.  The payment of bonuses to bankers is an affront when juxtaposed against cuts in the incomes of people who are barely surviving on the minimum wage.  It is an insult and certainly not how the country should do its business.The introduction of the new universal social charge will bring those on the minimum wage into the tax net.  The Minister misled the House last night when he stated those on the minimum wage would not be subject to taxation.  The universal social charge is a tax, as explicitly stated in Financial Resolution No. 13.  The Minister stated: "In the measures I am presenting today, those on the new reduced minimum wage will not be brought into the tax net."  Is he suggesting that those on the minimum wage will not be subjected to the universal social charge?  It is as clear as the nose on my face that if one earns more than €4,004, one will be subject to the charge at a rate of 2% up to €10,000.  There is a question mark over whether one can claim back the charge for the first €4,004.  This matter should be clarified.  The bottom line, however, is that the Government is not only reducing the minimum wage but removing the exemptions enjoyed by those on the minimum wage and subjecting them to a new tax.This measure is woefully inadequate and inequitable.  If one subscribes to the notion that everyone must share the pain proportionately, one must accept that the proposal requires people on the minimum wage to pay a disproportionate amount.  The measure must be opposed.  I am proud to oppose any proposal that seeks to reduce the pay of those who are on marginal incomes.
