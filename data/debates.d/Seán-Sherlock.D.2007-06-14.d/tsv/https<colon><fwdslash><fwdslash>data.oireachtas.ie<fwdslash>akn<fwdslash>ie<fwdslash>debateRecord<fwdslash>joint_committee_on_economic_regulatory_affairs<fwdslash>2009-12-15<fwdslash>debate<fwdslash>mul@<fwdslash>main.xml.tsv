SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I apologise for cutting across Deputy O'Donnell but how does Professor Honohan see these funds being recovered?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome Professor Honohan to the committee and congratulate him on his appointment.  I have witnessed a perceptible shift today in the language to which we have become accustomed from officials when dealing with the financial crisis, something which must be acknowledged.  I do not wish to denigrate other officials in any way for the language they use, but we are now in an era where we want things to be explained to us by officials such as Professor Honohan in a manner which everybody can understand and which is frank.  That is important for the future.I appreciate the fact that Professor Honohan is answering these questions honestly and openly.  It is refreshing.  I hope, when we look forward to the quarterly Central Bank reports, that if there are whisperings of bad omens on the wind they are not buried imperceptibly in language in the reports and are backed up by strong language from the Governor of the Central Bank, if that is a necessary course of action.I wish to return to the issue of Anglo Irish Bank.  I have to ask a question on behalf the people of Cork East, who I represent.  Like many people throughout the country, they are asking why, in the name of God, are we bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and nationalising it?  I do not think that question was answered sufficiently.  I appreciate that the decision is made and that Professor Honohan is coming from an academic background — he has stated that — but is now a banker.  As he is a banker I would like an honest view on whether we should cast it adrift.  If the capitalist model into which we have bought in this country is to be followed logically, whatever about AIB and Bank of Ireland, there is a school of thought which suggests Anglo Irish Bank should be let off.  The €4 billion and the €4 billion eile it is looking for will cast a noose around the necks of Irish people which we will have to wear for a long time.My second questions relates to the issue of prudential rules.  In his opening statement, Professor Honohan said, "There has been greatly intensified and what has been termed "intrusive" supervision of the operations of the main banks covered by the guarantee".  If I read this sentence one way, it could suggest "intrusive" was negative, but if read another way it could be positive.  It is negative in that the existing staff in the banks which are covered by the guarantee are not too happy about the intrusive nature of the new staffing arrangements with Professor Honohan's people.  Is that causing friction?  If so, why is it causing friction?  Will it need to continue for a considerable period of time until this issue is worked out?  How long will the situation continue for?The new prudential rules which will come into force will be largely determined by Brussels and the European Union.  The fear I have is that the Irish Government, as is often the case, will follow the City of London or the Government of the United Kingdom in terms of prudential rules regarding financial services.  If we are to be realistic about overhauling prudential rules in the future, and if there is a majority view which is contrary to the position of the United Kingdom, we should take a very responsible position.  I would like to hear Professor Honohan's views on the matter.On the macro situation, last night a Minister said on television that at least we are not Greece and that we should look at how bad things are there, which was an extraordinary statement.  If we are now being compared with Greece, we know things are really bad.  Is there a role for the Governor of the Central Bank vis-à-vis the European Central Bank, in terms of influencing monetary policy in particular, and fiscal policy?  I am not necessarily espousing that but I want to get a view on the theory that a devaluation of the currency would sort out some of our problems.  I am looking for a macro view but I would also like to hear Professor Honohan’s personal opinion on that.On the issue of remuneration, will the staff of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority be taking a pay cut?  I refer Mr. Honohan to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill 2009 being debated in the House as we speak.  The Schedule to that Bill clearly shows that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland are bodies to which the definition of "public service body" does not apply.  Those bodies were excluded from the Schedule to the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act and presumably they were subjected to the levies imposed as a result of the enactment of that legislation.  My question is whether Mr. Honohan will be taking a hair cut — that term has been used — and, if not, why not?  In Mr. Honohan's opinion, why has the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland been included in the Schedule to the No. 2 Bill when it was not previously?  Was the Minister for Finance lobbied in regard to that issue?I raise this issue because the previous regulator, and this must be restated, got out of Dodge with approximately €600,000 in his back pocket.  A constituent of mine would ask me these questions and how he managed to do that.  If public sector workers, for instance, who are on €30,000 a year are taking a haircut of €1,500 as per the legislation proposed today, why are bodies like the regulatory body not doing the same?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I have a number of questions and I ask for some leeway from the Chair.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is any man or woman worth that amount of money?  Professor Honohan will talk about the relativity of taking the pay cut vis-à-vis——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	He would not have come for less.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How is this country still in a scenario where we are paying that kind of money to people to overhaul a regulatory framework given that the European Union regulatory framework will be overhauled and there will be a large buy-in by the Irish State into that process anyway? It could be done for a considerably reduced cost than the princely sum of €400,000 plus the bonus if he reaches a target.  We need to move away from the culture of spending that kind of money on public officials when there are other people in the State who are taking savage cuts.  It does not make sense to ordinary people.  Ordinary people will look at that and say it is obscene.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will park that issue and respectfully agree to disagree with Mr. Honohan.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In a pre-guarantee scenario---
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In a pre-guarantee scenario there is a school of thought that says that Anglo Irish Bank is a failed entity and that one should have cast it adrift.  While there would have been a tremor, the systemic effects for the economy as a whole would arguably not have been too high on the Richter scale.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate that and I suppose we are trying to look to the future.  With that in mind, does Professor Honohan feel he has perfect knowledge as to what is going on within Anglo Irish Bank?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	My other question was about Greece.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If we buy into that scenario — and arguably the main political parties have bought into that agenda — the question that is still outstanding for people of my generation, who have taken on massive amounts of debt, is that the debt is not being restructured in any great shape or fashion, but wages are coming down significantly.  There is a real problem there.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are trying to get to the nub of the situation.  If one has a statutory pension scheme then arguably one will provide a greater degree of security for people.  If there is a code of conduct, however, there is nothing to suggest at this stage that the banks will adhere to any kind of code.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It concerns the operation of the mortgage moratorium where somebody finds himself or herself in trouble.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am not convinced that mortgage interest relief is necessarily the only way to go.  That will provide some relief, but there will be a certain number of people who cannot repay mortgages.  For instance, when this Bill is enacted, which it invariably will be, a certain percentage of the population earning €40,000 or less, will no longer be able to pay their mortgages, in spite of the fact that prices are falling in the economy.  That will have a knock-on effect.  They remain to be convinced that the banking structure, as it currently exists, will adequately give them a break if they find themselves in difficulty and start missing payments, which they invariably will after this on Thursday.  I appreciate that Professor Honohan is not necessarily in a position to comment on the legislation that is going ahead, but from a layman's point of view, and anecdotal evidence of those who are now in real financial difficulty, there is a perception that the banks are getting off lightly in terms of putting together something that would give people a break on their mortgages.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If we increase capitalisation, that scenario will prove to be the case.
