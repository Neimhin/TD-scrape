SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:30:00+01:00	I seek advice on the issue. Amendments in my name and those of Deputies Rabbitte and Funchion have been ruled out of order. They were tabled in good faith. To my mind we have not received a comprehensive justification as to why they have been ruled out of order. I seek permission to hear from the Minister as to that justification.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:30:00+01:00	I understand from the Minister's Second Stage speech that the Bill contains a presumption in favour of the appointment of a guardian ad litem.If so, I do not see how from a resource point of view of putting a charge on the Exchequer our amendments run contrary to that. What we are seeking to do through our amendments is buttress the existing system.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	I beg the Chairman's indulgence before the Minister replies. The other issue I have is the constitutionality of the legislation under Article 42A.4.1o, which reads:(i) brought by the State, as guardian of the common good, for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, or(ii) concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child,the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.I know that the Minister is acting in good faith in respect of this provision, but our fear is that the postcode lottery will be an issue. For instance, it is not always the case that a guardian ad litem may be appointed. It depends on the judge and where he or she sits. It is at the judge's discretion. This is an issue that has been-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	It is important.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	This issue has been highlighted by the Child Care Law Reporting Project. In some areas of the country, guardians are only appointed in a small number of cases. The justification for our amendments has to do with the prediction that the current iteration of the Bill will have no significant impact on that phenomenon. That is our worry. I wish to declare at this stage that, if we do not resolve the issue today, I will seek to have it addressed on Report Stage. I want to put down that marker.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	I am seeking for the Minister to speak to the issue, but I am also-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	Actually, the Ceann Comhairle has not ruled on this. As I understand the matter, it is the Bills Office-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	-----and the Chairman who have ruled on it-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	-----based on advice. I wish to see the advice or have regard to it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	May I ask a question?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	The Chairman is in possession of the advice.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	He will make it available.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	Could we have a copy of it so that we might read it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	I thank the Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	The Minister is sympathetic to the position in which the three Deputies here find themselves.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	Three, because they are our amendments that have been ruled out of order. We are seeking to legislate with one hand tied behind our backs. It was only at the 11th hour last night that we were told that the-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:40:00+01:00	Please, Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	May I be allowed to make a point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	We are on Committee Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	It is actually pertinent.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	I am responding to what the Minister just said.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	There is no other committee in these Houses that would try to close off debate at this point on Committee Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	In that case, will the Chairman please allow me to make my point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	I am not trying to be obstreperous. I merely wish to make a point in respect of the fact that our amendments were ruled out of order. The Minister has declared that she is sympathetic to the views and she has also said, if I understood her correctly, that there are other reasons they have been disallowed. I know that the Minister will get to that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	However, it still does not address the fact that our amendments were ruled out of order at the 11th hour last night-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	I ask the Chairman to please allow me to finish.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	Time has been allocated for this debate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	If the Chairman keeps interrupting me-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	I am not being pedantic.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	This is very important-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	We have not had this row before.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	This is not a row. I merely wish to ask why we are being told that our amendments are out of order and that there was advice to that effect but we have not physically received the advice. I have not been able to read the advice which the Chairman said he would make available to us-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T09:50:00+01:00	Quite frankly, we need that advice if we are to determine how to proceed on Committee Stage. I do not think the Chairman understands this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:00:00+01:00	The Chairman has made his point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:00:00+01:00	I would like to hear the Minister's response to the amendment and I reserve the right to revisit it on report Stage. I anticipate that the Minister may not be in favour of the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:10:00+01:00	I accept that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:10:00+01:00	I am prepared to withdraw the amendment but I reserve the right to revisit the matter on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 8:In page 8, to delete lines 6 to 11 and substitute the following:“(a) furnish to the court reports that—(i) convey to the court any views expressed by the child in relation to the matters to which the proceedings relate, and(ii) contain the recommendations of the guardian ad litem regardingwhat is in the best interests of the child and the reasons for thoserecommendations,”. I would like to hear the Minister's view on this amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 9:In page 8, lines 32 and 33, to delete “to that party” and substitute “that party shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to read the report,”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:20:00+01:00	To quote the Minister, we will withdraw and reflect on the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:30:00+01:00	The Minister again makes the point that the Bill needs to be read as a whole. Looking at the section 35 provisions from an Opposition point of view, there can be gaps geographically in the system at District Court level. In some parts of the country there is quite a robust service. Again, to quote the Minister, in the absence of a family court system where we are relying on the District Court, we need to try to buttress the wording such that there is certainty. Where there are gaps in the service, we need to buttress that service to ensure that, for instance, in this amendment, people will have reasonable opportunity to read the report. That is the spirit in which we are proposing the amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:30:00+01:00	We can choose to press amendments or we can seek to work with the Minister to consider the matter further on Report Stage. My colleagues may wish to press the amendment, and if they do, I will support that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 14:In page 9, to delete lines 1 and 2.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:40:00+01:00	I have had regard to public interventions. In one case, a solicitor of long standing who is operating in Cork, Mr. Colm Roberts, is on the public record as part of process of interrogating and examining the role of guardians ad litem. He stated in a recent presentation:In 2009 I raised my concern in another child care case before the District Court in Cork as I believed that as a legal advisor for parents, I was at a disadvantage in cases where the extent and role of the Gal was unclear, and particularly the extent and role of his/her legal representation was even more unsettling as it seemed to move the Gal into a more adversarial role. This particularly became more acute in circumstances where the Gal was supporting the application for Care Orders by the Child & Family Agency (previously HSE). This is very problematic for the Court to balance the right of the Gal to fully participate in proceedings that he/she has been appointed in and at the same time ensure that natural justice and fairness to all parties is protected and vindicated. This issue was dealt with in detail [in] a judgment by District judge Mitchell. In putting forward the amendment to delete, we want to strike a balance between the presumption in favour of the appointment of the guardian ad litem and the discretion of the District Court in the absence of a fully fledged family courts infrastructure, while seeking to give a voice to the guardian ad litem, which is the voice of the child before the court. I do not see what is so injurious about our intention to delete these lines. I am not a lawyer and I have never been a witness before a court, in particular proceedings before the family courts, so I am a layman in this respect. We are seeking to ensure that voice is absolutely robust in the absence of there being a fully fledged family courts infrastructure. Again, this goes back to the geographical disparities that exist between certain parties where, without being disrespectful to District Court judges, not every District Court judge has the training in respect of these types of cases that come before them. Is there a formula of words that would copperfasten the importance of the role of the guardian ad litem without necessarily calling for them not to be a party? The Minister would say that is in other sections and is already inherent within the legislation.We are effectively trying a belt and braces approach but I have an open mind about how the Minister might respond to that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:50:00+01:00	I have sympathy for Mr. Roberts if he represents a parent. I mention Mr. Roberts in particular because he is on the public record having made submissions to this process and Bill but he could be any solicitor around the country. This is an adversarial system. I have sympathy for the Minister when she states that the guardian ad litem is not automatically a party to proceedings. However, we are trying to strike a balance and recognise the fact that the system operates differently in different parts of the country. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned a child with intellectual disabilities or a child with no voice and there are any number of types of case to which we can refer but in certain parts of this country, there is no automatic entitlement, right or prospect of a child having a guardian ad litem. Does the Minister acknowledge that is the case?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:50:00+01:00	I want to confer with my colleagues for a moment, if I may. It is like being on a quiz show.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:50:00+01:00	Subject to the agreement of my colleagues, that seems to be a reasonable proposal.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:50:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 15: In page 9, line 6, to delete “subject to subsection (3),”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T10:50:00+01:00	It will be clear to the Minister that we are also engaging with the relevant stakeholders in respect of these amendments. We are proposing these amendments jointly on foot of advice we have received. We reserve the right to revisit these amendments subject to a discussion with the various stakeholders with whom we have been engaging.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:00:00+01:00	In support of that, the reasoning for our amendments is that guardians could and would have the time to engage with children in a way that social workers would not. We have borne witness to the infrastructure that exists in this country, the shortage of social workers, the constraints and so on. Where there were court proceedings, the guardian ad litem would fulfil a specific role. I do not think the Minister would necessarily disagree with what I am saying. We are all largely on the same page about seeking to ensure that the rights of the child are adhered to as per the constitutional amendment. Again we find ourselves slightly constrained with regard to what we proposed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:00:00+01:00	We are not saying that they are either.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 16:In page 9, to delete lines 23 to 25.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 19:In page 9, line 32, to delete “to that party” and substitute “that party shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to read the report,”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	May I get written statement in regard to the ruling on amendment No. 24?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	I will withdraw it, while reserving the right to revisit the issue on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 27:In page 17, to delete line 3 and substitute the following: 	"2012. 
Annual Report 
	35R. The Minister will cause an annual report in respect of the management and functioning of the national guardian ad litem service to be published on an annual basis by or before the conclusion of each calendar year.".". 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	My first instinct in regard to what the Minister is proposing to introduce on Report Stage in regard to having her officials attend at family courts is to be concerned about it. However, we will have an opportunity to examine that proposal further on Report Stage. I would like to speak to section 35-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	I accept what the Minister said. I will withdraw the amendment, while reserving the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage but I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	In light of what the Minister said subsequent to speaking to my amendment-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:20:00+01:00	My understanding of what the Minister said is that she proposes to bring forth an amendment to allow her officials to attend judicial proceedings.I am worried about the proposed new section 35D(2) of the Child Care Act 1991, as inserted by the section of the Bill we are discussing, which states:Following the making of an order under section 35B(3), the Minister may at the request of the guardian ad litem appointed for the child provide, or arrange for the provision, to the guardian ad litem of such legal advice or legal representation, or both, as the Minister considers appropriate having regard to the matters specified in subsection (3).The proposed new section 35B(3) states:In proceedings under Part IV, IVB or VI the District Court, of its own motion or on the application of any party to the proceedings, shall consider whether to direct that a guardian ad litem be appointed for a child and the court may by order so direct.I wonder where the Minister is going with the creation of this entity within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I may have inadvertently and incorrectly stated on Second Stage that responsibility for this entity will be given to Tusla. That was an error on my part. We are now creating an entity that will come under the remit of the Minister of the day. Obviously, the Minister will have control of its budget. While the Minister will not become a party to court proceedings, he or she will be able to go into courts. Could that put the Minister into conflict with the child law reporting project, for instance? We have only just received this information. I am speaking for myself as an Opposition spokesperson when I say that all stakeholders continue to have a lot of respect for the independence of the Child Care Law Reporting Project. Any recommendations made arising from the work of the project have the confidence of everybody who is involved in the whole area of childcare law.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	Will it be left to the discretion of the District Court judge?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	May I ask-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	It is being introduced now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	I appreciate that. I appreciate the fact that it is being introduced for discussion on Report Stage.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	It is still being introduced. The Minister did not mention this on Second Stage. It was not included in her Second Stage speech. I wonder-----

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	I have-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	I am being absolutely civil. I merely wish to say that this is being introduced on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:30:00+01:00	I am just making the point. It would have been useful to have known this on Second Stage because it would have given us a better chance to discuss these matters at this stage of the proceedings, when amendments are being introduced on Committee Stage. The Minister has yet to address the reason she intends to bring forward the Report Stage amendment.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:40:00+01:00	On the Schedule, since I have not had an opportunity to speak to the fact that my amendment was ruled out of order in respect of the role of the-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:40:00+01:00	I thank the Chairman. I really appreciate that. It would have been useful to have heard from the Minister on that. Perhaps the Minister-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-10-23T11:40:00+01:00	On the issue of the role of the ombudsman in respect of the legislation before us and whether that could be discussed on Report Stage.
