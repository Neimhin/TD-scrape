SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	That is a bit of a flimsy argument.  The Deputy is clutching at straws.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Give us a little time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Deputy has some neck.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	No, the queen is coming.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I welcome the jobs initiative.  It was not designed to be a panacea and I do not believe a panacea can be achieved in such a short space of time.  What it seeks to do, however, is to provide an overarching framework which will underpin the economic recovery.  Within that framework there is a set of criteria so existing jobs can be maintained, the cost of doing business can be reduced, people can be helped back to work and there can be an attempt to restore confidence in the economy.  In that way people can begin the recovery which is so vital to our national interest and to the interests of those people who are looking at this House and asking what we are trying to do to fulfil our mandate to them.At this juncture members of the Opposition may posit the notion that the initiative does not necessarily fulfil all the obligations set out in the Labour Party or Fine Gael manifestos.  However, a programme for Government was agreed and mandated by this House.  In the normal day to day life of a parliament we score points off one another — this is vital and we have all done it.  The situation is that we will not get the 400,000 people we want to see back in work back at work within eight or nine weeks.  It is simply not possible.  What we can do, however, is to try to instil some confidence and some pride in the fact that governance in this country is based on the idea that we will serve the people——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	——to the best of our ability.  We are trying within the very meagre resources we have — which were squandered — to try to fulfil a programme that sets down these very parameters.I fulfilled the research and innovation brief and am greatly encouraged that the research and development tax credit will bring about a benefit in ensuring we can try to fulfil that agenda.  It is vital to our national interest.  I acknowledge that the parameters set down in the agenda for research and development are as a result of work by successive Governments in the past, including the previous one.  Through the State agencies they identified the vital part research and innovation fulfils in supporting jobs.  The single message that emerges is that if we do not support the research and innovation agenda now, over a longer period it will be very difficult to be able to maintain existing jobs acquired through foreign direct investment.  If parent companies see that we are not continuing our investment in such research this may send a signal that this agenda is being sidelined.  It is vital that through initiatives such as the one announced yesterday we send a signal to the world that we will continue to ensure we can maintain the number of jobs we have, as well maintaining the quality link between research and foreign direct investment related jobs and thereby continue to attract further jobs.I wish to speak specifically about the area of research and development.  The positive evidence for economic recovery is clear.  This year, for the first time in three years, we can look forward to positive growth which we fully expect to accelerate as we move into 2012 and beyond.  This is by contrast with the years between 2007 and 2010 when the volume of goods and services produced in Ireland fell by 12%.  On foot of recent gains in competitiveness and improving external demand the exporting sectors of the economy are once again performing very well generally.  Last year exports increased by 9.5% in real terms, the strongest rate of growth for more than a decade.  Looking to the future, export growth is projected at around 6.75% in 2011 and 5.75% in 2012.Our focus now, and for the foreseeable future, is on the maintenance and growth of sustainable jobs.  I am glad to say the auguries are good on this front.  The number of foreign investment projects in Ireland rose by 15% in 2010.  These came about because of the proactivity of State agencies such as IDA Ireland which was responsible for the creation of approximately 11,000 jobs, more than double the figure of 5,000 for 2009.  That transcends two mandates, two Governments.  I acknowledge, as one must, this came about as part of a previous Government's mandate.  Moreover, these are quality projects.  In the area of attractiveness for research and development projects, Ireland is positioned in fifth place, behind Finland, Taiwan, Israel and Puerto Rico.  The joint Forfás and CSO 2009-2010 business expenditure survey on research and development, BERD, was published on 29 April and it, too, tells a positive story.  The BERD results indicate that in spite of expectations research and development expenditure in indigenous Irish businesses remained strong during 2009 and estimates indicate continued growth in research and development spend in 2010.During a recession one might expect to see companies make cuts in areas such as innovation and research and development spend but the BERD figures show that Irish businesses continue to invest in this area, mainly due to recognition of the importance of bringing new and innovative goods and services to the market in order to remain competitive and to grow exports.  This is very positive as this sustained research and development investment is what will underpin future economic growth, jobs and exports.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I wish I had more time but am glad to have what I have.  Today I attended an event where Johnson & Johnson, a company with a significant presence in this country, had its global management structure meet at Carton House.  That company sustains more than 2,000 jobs in this country.  Arising from that, Science Foundation Ireland hosted an event which showed how innovative Ireland is.  There was a showcase, with more than 30 companies and research functions coming together.  There is one clear message that comes across when one talks to people from Johnson & Johnson and other companies of that nature.  We must send a signal to them that we want to push out the boundaries on framework programme 7, which sees a target of some €600 million being achieved.  We must show that we can look forward, via the European Commissioner, Máire Geoghegan Quinn, and an enhanced relationship with the European Commission, to continuing, in framework 8, to push the boundaries further.  We must signal to companies like Johnson & Johnson our commitment to the research and development component and show we are committed to the spend in hitting certain targets that will see us grow jobs in the area.  Investments made in recent years are already beginning to pay off.The initiative launched yesterday is a signalling exercise to companies that have invested in this country.  It states we are still very serious about ensuring we can retain them and the right kind of conditions so the companies and researchers we fund will be able to sustain this economy in the long run.  During the 1970s we depended on agriculture in terms of inputs from a European Union perspective, while during the 1980s and 1990s it was infrastructure.  The next big tranche in sustaining jobs will be on the research, scientific, technological and innovation side.  We must continue with this agenda.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	May I clarify the point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Was it not put to a vote and passed by a majority of the House?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	With all due respect, that is what the Deputy is doing.
