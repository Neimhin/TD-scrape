SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How will the inspection regime work in practice?  If I was a farmer, would I be visited by the environment section of the local authority, such as Cork County Council, by an EPA inspector, and by a Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food inspector, all of whom would inspect what I did in terms of the provisions in the directive?  Also, who has primacy on the issue — the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  How is it envisioned the action programmes will be devised and how will they work in practice?  Will they be based on information garnered from individual inspections?  It is difficult to understand how the provisions can be implemented, to be honest.  What will be the cost to the Exchequer of their implementation?  Will the cost be borne by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or by the local authorities?  If local authorities will bear the cost, will they need to redeploy existing staff to carry out the inspections, given that there is an embargo on local authorities' taking on new staff?I am not a scientist but a layman in this respect, but the objective of the nitrates directive is to reduce water pollution caused by nitrates and phosphorus from agricultural sources and to prevent further such pollution.  Does it deal only with phosphorus from agricultural sources or does it also deal with other sources?  The witness mentioned the dangerous substances directive.  Is he saying pollution caused by phosphorus comes primarily from agricultural sources or are other dangerous substances encompassed within the ECJ judgment?I represent Cork East and the towns of Mallow and Fermoy are within my constituency.  Mallow is my home town.  The wastewater treatment plant there is woefully inadequate and will not meet the needs of a town of that size.  My understanding is that it has no phosphorus control or removal facility, but I ask the witnesses to clarify that.  What is spent on phosphorus removal facilities?  What percentage of wastewater treatment plants and sewage treatment plants do not have those facilities?I return to my earlier question about the preparation and publication of the action programme.  The regulations state that the Minister shall "prepare and publish not later than 30 June 2010 and every four years thereafter, a programme of measures [...] for the protection of waters against pollution from agriculture".  What measures are being taken to prevent pollution from sources other than agriculture?  Do they also fall within the remit of the dangerous substances directive?  It seems that this duplication of effort will actually end up costing the Exchequer a lot more through the expending of resources and it will place an increased burden on those who are involved in agricultural production.  I fail to see how the Department will be able to implement this regulation without expending massive resources and I ask for a comment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What was the basis of the ECJ ruling, then, if the Department has been carrying out inspections since 2005?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is important to give time to the subject.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to the inspections regime.  The statutory instrument confers fairly extensive powers on the Garda, local authorities and statutory bodies in terms of entering a farm for the purposes of the regulation.  Mr. Allen stated that approximately 3,200 inspections were carried out since 2005——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In light of the regulation which has been in place since 31 March how many inspections does the delegation envisage will be carried out?  Who will have the primary objective in this regard?  Will it be the local authority, the EPA or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?  If it is to be a local authority, will it be granted increased resources to enable it to do this work and, if so, what figure has been put aside for this purpose?  I am trying to get at the cost to the Exchequer as a result of this statutory instrument in terms of an inspection regime.  Will it ultimately lead to improved water quality?  If I return to the distinction Mr. Duggan makes between the urban wastewater treatment directive and the dangerous substances directive, and take the improvements made in agricultural practices, the Department, through lack of resources provided for local authorities, is the main culprit in low water quality.  That is the central point.  I do not understand why we are adding another layer of bureaucracy when we should streamline the bureaucratic function.  I would like to know the specifics on the inspections regime, how many will be carried out over the next 12 months, by whom and at what cost to the Exchequer.  I would like very specific answers.  If the witnesses cannot answer those questions today perhaps they could revert to me.
