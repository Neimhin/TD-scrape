SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister neglected to mention that before the Common Position was reached, it was proposed to reduce the quantities of pesticides supplied or used by 50%.  That proposal did not take into account the national plant health requirement to have certain substances available.  Similarly, it did not take into consideration the properties of the substances concerned.  Will a list of the specific pesticides that are to be prohibited as a result of the directive, or the Common Position that has been reached, be provided?  The Minister mentioned that people will have to be trained to use pesticides.  Will such training comprise another layer of bureaucracy to be dealt with by landowners and farmers before they can set about their daily business of growing crops?  What is the Irish position on this directive?  I accept that the directive is specifically aimed at protecting human and animal health, which is laudable.  We need to find out, within the remit of Question Time, what impact the directive will have on farmers and landowners.  Will a list of pesticides be prescribed?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	When Ministers speak about EU legislation, they have a tendency to use words like "lacuna".  The Minister's response was somewhat confusing.  I will try to interpret it as best I can when I read the Official Report.  If there is a Common Position and a framework for Community action, there will be a prescribed set of pesticide uses or functions.  Will there be a defined list?  Will pesticide users be required to undertake training?  Does the Minister envisage that this will be implemented within a certain timeframe?  The Minister has said that Ireland had an alliance with Britain and Hungary on this issue, but what position did the three countries take?  Did Ireland abstain when the vote was taken on the final Common Position?  Did Ireland vote against it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I understand the target set by the EU Commission for the production of biofuels is 10% by 2020.  The European Parliament and its environment committee, which consists of members from across the political divide, voted to scale down the proposed EU-wide target of 10% by 2020 to 4% by 2015.  Notwithstanding the 1,800 hectares of miscanthus planted, to which the Minister of State referred, we have moved from the planting of 137 hectares of energy crops in 2003 to just more than 9,000 hectares in 2007, which represents approximately 0.02% of all agricultural land.  Teagasc has estimated that potentially 75,000 to 100,000 hectares of land could be devoted to energy crops in Ireland without impacting negatively on food production.Are the targets that have been set realistic?  Is the Government doing enough to encourage farmers to get into the business of growing crops for fuel?  How will the food versus fuel debate impact on Ireland?  What is the Government doing to encourage more farmers to diversify into such production?  Is there a ready market available for fuel crops?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I put it to the Minister that it is hardly a bureaucratic target, it is a political target that was reached partly with the agreement of the green movement throughout the European Union.  I do not mean to be facetious when I say that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We are currently at a point where fuel prices have decreased due to the fall in oil prices.   The Government has a tendency to take its foot off the pedal with regard to developing a coherent and long-term policy.  Post CAP reform, there will be an abyss into which many Irish farmers will fall.  There will be significant loss of revenue.  This is one way in which the slack can be taken up.  I put it to the Minister that the Government must come back to the House with a defined Government policy on how farmers can look to the future with regard to alternative energy production and the creation of markets.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The question is whether there will be a loss of money to farmers.  The point of modulation, as the Minister has stated, is to contribute towards environmental measures such as water conservation.  Will the moneys involved be controlled by the Department?  Will they be paid directly to farmers, or will they be paid to other agencies as determined by the Department to administer those schemes?  The point is whether farmers will lose money through the measures that are supposed to be incorporated within modulation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	To what extent does the Minister believe that the commodification of dairy products and the fact that they are tradeable commodities has an effect on the markets and on the price of milk for Irish farmers?  This should be taken into account.  Are there discussions at EU level or within the WTO framework to tackle the fact that commodification is causing great vagaries in prices?  That is having an impact on the market here.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I anticipate that the Minister of State will spend some time in the air to visit some of the events.  I welcome the fact that there is a significant budget for Bord Bia.  It is money well spent when one thinks of the return.  The €8 billion to €9 billion in food exports will be one of the saviours if this economy is to lift itself out of recession.  The emphasis on food production will be vital in that sense.Has there been a full restoration of the markets in light of the pork dioxin scare?  I refer to the markets prior to 6 December.  As I understand it, we have lost some market share to the UK because of the sterling differential, which is a major factor.  I welcome the Minister of State's answer but we need to step up our efforts in terms of the potential of continental Europe given that we have 33% of exports there currently.  There is a greater potential in continental Europe.  I do not necessarily expect the Minister of State to come back with a reply on that one given the timeframe — it is just by way of a general comment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We wish to support the motion on the basis that the permutations of the HSE Teamwork-Howarth report for the delivery of care for people in the mid-west will have untold consequences for those who do not live in the region served by Limerick Regional Hospital.  In addressing this motion I wish to speak specifically for the southern region, where the national service plan has been published.  We have also recently received a document from the HSE stating that new efficiencies to the value of €80 million are sought in its operations.  The Teamwork-Howarth report has not been published in the south.  Having read the Fine Gael motion and the prescriptions of the Teamwork-Howarth report for the mid-west, I do not doubt that the delivery of services in the combined Munster region, as espoused in this document, will have a negative effect on hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and Mallow.  While I might be accused of being parochial, it is important to note that the hospital in Mallow is like those in Ennis and Mallow, and to address this as a Munster-wide issue.There has been no politically accountable, coherent analysis of the HSE's proposals.  This is the first time that the House has had an opportunity to properly debate their implications and it is happening on Opposition time.  The Government should make time available to debate the issues adequately so that we can go through the implications of these proposals euro by euro, and hospital by hospital.We have witnessed the erosion by stealth of services at the former county hospital in Mallow.  A CT scanner was put in place a few years ago and became operational last year for approximately ten to 15 hours per week, but now runs for between four and six hours per week.  Last week, we found out that the ear, nose and throat services will be taken away in one fell swoop.  We have also been notified that no children under the age of 16 will be treated within the hospital and that the long-term plan is to replace the accident and emergency unit with a nurse-led minor injuries clinic.The motion notes that between 15 and 30 people are regularly on trolleys for over 24 hours in Limerick Regional Hospital.  If services in Mallow are further reduced the same will apply to Cork University Hospital.  We in the Munster region are arguing for a re-think of the policy.  Clinicians who advise me, and the 120 GPs who serve the hospital, say that there should be no diminution in services in Mallow general hospital until the HSE can guarantee that the services are available in Cork University Hospital.  That is the logic of the argument being applied to Limerick Regional Hospital and to the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  There is a complete lack of foresight in the approach to this.  Every time I raise the issue with the upper echelons of the HSE management in the southern region, I meet vague answers and lack of specifics.I do not see how the Minister can dress up the service plan for the southern region as a configuration, or a reconfiguration, because it drives a coach and four through the services being delivered to the catchment areas of Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh.  Those who reside in the catchment areas will have to travel further to get into Cork University Hospital and Limerick Regional which will force more people through a narrow bottleneck.  The services and capacity do not exist within those hospitals.  There is no logic in seeking to further downgrade the satellite hospitals that serve Cork University and Limerick Regional Hospitals.  We want a proper debate on this and I ask that the Government make time available for it.  I appreciate that Fine Gael raised this issue and we support it.How much time do I have left?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Why are Fianna Fáil Deputies elected by these constituencies allowing this to happen?  Why do those Deputies constantly move to blame it on the HSE?  Are we to believe that Professor Drumm, by virtue of his management of the HSE, is the de facto Minister for Health and Children?  Is there no voice on the Government backbenches from the Munster region served by the hospitals at Mallow, Ennis and Nenagh that will call a halt to what the HSE is trying to do?  If we proceed with the degradation of services at these hospitals there is no way that hospitals such as Cork University and Limerick Regional will be able to deal with the capacity.  That will have untold consequences.The hospital in Mallow serves over 100,000 people in four counties.  I speak to the staff in Cork University hospital and if one visits it on any given day, one will see that the accident and emergency unit cannot cope with the numbers coming through.  Why would the Government seek to further diminish services to the satellite hospitals?We support the motion and believe that if the Government backbenchers who represent constituencies served by the hospitals at Ennis, Nenagh and Mallow have any backbone they will support such motions because in that way they will support the people.
