SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank Senator Ã“ Domhnaill for raising this important issue.  The Senator refers to an announcement last December that the means test for student grants will be amended to take account of the value of certain capital assets as well as income for the 2013-14 academic year.  A considerable body of reports over a number of years have strongly recommended the introduction of a capital test for student grants, particularly on the grounds of equity and fairness.  The introduction of such a test would create a more equitable basis for means testing through a more complete analysis of a family's capacity to support their children in pursuing further or higher education.The Senator will appreciate that in the context of the current financial climate, the importance of accurately targeting increasingly scarce resources to those who need them most has become a high priority.  Given the increasing cost of providing student maintenance grants, the potential for this proposal to deliver cost savings on the student grant budget is also a critical consideration at this time.  While the introduction of a capital assets test for student grants may traditionally have been perceived as being likely to affect the farming community in particular, this is not the object of the proposal.  I emphasise that the proposal is not designed to target any one group.The Senator is aware that a dedicated capital asset test implementation group has been established, as he referred to this in his speech.  The group has been charged with introducing detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013-14 academic year.  The group has met on three occasions and its deliberations are ongoing.  I expect the group to report to the Minister by the summer and to make recommendations on the inclusion or exclusion of various classes of asset.  Any proposals will require further Government agreement and necessitate legislative amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Senator for the points made.  I respectfully suggest to him that not all farm income is necessarily a matter of public record.  We would both agree on that.  However, I understand the Senator's point about double-counting farm incomes.  That is clearly set out in the application form.  The Minister will be receiving a report on this, and I will certainly convey to him the concerns outlined by the Senator.  He need have no doubt about that.
