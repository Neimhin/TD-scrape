SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	In the EMI v. UPC High Court judgment of 11 October 2010, Mr. Justice Charleton decided that he was constrained by the wording of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and could not grant an injunction in respect of infringement of copyright against an information service provider, ISP, in the circumstances of “mere conduit”.  Accordingly, he stated that Ireland was in breach of its EU obligations in that respect."Mere conduit" provides that if an information service provider does not initiate a transmission or modify the material contained in a transmission and does not select the receiver of the transmission, it is granted a "safe harbour" against liability by virtue of the e-commerce directive.  However, this does not affect the power of the courts to require service providers to terminate or prevent copyright infringements.Two EU directives, namely, the copyright directive of 2001 and the enforcement directive of 2004 specifically require that the holders of copyright, authors, music composers, lyricists, record producers, etc., are in a position to apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.My Department had considered that injunctions were already available under section 40(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act and the inherent power of the courts to grant injunctions, which are equitable and discretionary remedies, granted according to settled principles, developed by the courts.  However, this was not the court's view in the case.Having examined the High Court judgement referred to, which was extremely long and complex, the Deputy will be aware that my Department sought the advice of the then Attorney General as to the implications of the judgment and any legislative changes which might be required arising from it.In furnishing his advice on the issues raised, the Attorney General indicated it would be prudent to consult both with his office and with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with regard to any implementing measures arising from the ruling concerned to ensure that any such measures do not impose any unnecessarily onerous obligations on the Internet service providers.Accordingly, my Department has been in consultations with both the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as to the terms of any legislative instrument which should be made in this area and I expect to consult interested parties to the case very soon about proposed action in this respect.It is important to note that my Department does not propose to introduce a "three strikes" regime for disconnection from the Internet, as has been introduced by France and the United Kingdom, but simply proposes to provide explicitly for injunctions to be granted, as obligated by the two EU directives I mentioned earlier.Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.All other member states of the European Union would have powers to grant such injunctions enshrined in their domestic legislation by virtue of their transposition of the aforementioned two directives.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	As I have stated, a consultation process is ongoing.  As Minister, I have just come to this issue, although as it happened I had taken an interest in the matter when the judgment was issued.  I have consulted officials in my Department and, as Minister, I have signalled today that the Government must make progress on this matter.  I am not in a position to provide a definitive timeline to the Deputy at this juncture but, as he stated, there is a clear and urgent need to engage on this issue and to ensure the directives are properly transposed.  I will revert to the Deputy.  While I am not obfuscating on the answer, given it was a 70-page judgment and is a quite complex area, I ask that I may revert to the Deputy within a week, when some indicative timelines could be available.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	A table outlining the expenditure since 1975 is available with this reply.  Ireland became a member of the European Space Agency in 1975.  The purpose of Ireland's membership of the ESA is to participate in the European space programme, thereby facilitating innovative Irish companies to develop leading edge space technologies and to commercially exploit their ESA participation.  A total of €14.029 million has been committed in 2011 in respect of Ireland's subscription to the European space programme.  The focus of the Irish ESA industrial strategy is to build scale in participating Irish companies by supporting technology and product development that can be exploited in both the commercial space and other non-space markets.Ireland's ESA membership has contributed to the development of a highly knowledge-intensive industry sector with in excess of 70 Irish technology companies having secured ESA contracts since 2000.  ESA participation has a demonstrated direct effect on the participating companies' ability to generate commercial export sales in the supply of products in the commercial space and non-space market.  An analysis of Ireland's ESA membership in 2008 concluded that Irish ESA contractors generated a total turnover of €136 million in 2007.  A recent survey by Enterprise Ireland of the top 19 Irish companies representing over 60% of activities in the space sector projects an increased growth in ESA-derived sales from €35 million in 2010 to €96 million by 2014.  Employment in these companies is projected to almost double from 865 in 2008 to more than 1,600 in 2014 and 65% of these jobs are at graduate and postgraduate level.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	If the Deputy will forgive me, I did not quite understand his question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Not quite but I can tell the Deputy that in my own constituency of Cork East, which is also the constituency of his colleague, Deputy Sandra McLellan, we have Elfordstown which is doing a lot of work on commercial satellite technology and also research on space.  I do not believe we should close our minds on this issue but rather have open minds and if commercial benefit can be derived from it, then we should take it.  As to whether I am going to inhabit that medium, the jury is out on that one.

A wide range of programmes are being delivered by the Enterprise Agencies — IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, to promote innovation and give Irish enterprise a competitive edge in the global market place.Numerous measures have been taken to support enterprise to ensure that trade, exports and investment are positioned to retain sustainability and to ensure that emerging opportunities can be maximized.  These include: — R&D Funding through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland  — Competence Centres established in strategically important sectoral areas like nanotechnology and bioenergy, and the new generation of Technology Centres.  The Centres are designed to allow groups of multinational and indigenous firms to work together with academics to undertake cutting edge, industry led research.  — Supports for new start-up companies with the potential to achieve significant exports — 80 new High Potential Start Ups were established in 2010 — In 2010, over 49 pieces of commercially relevant technology were transferred from State Funded Research into industry. — The Enterprise Ireland Technology Transfer System facilitated the creation of 31 spin-out companies in 2010   — 526 Innovation Vouchers were redeemed in 2010 worth over €2.5m, bringing the total number of Innovation Vouchers redeemed since the scheme opened to over 1,000. — Collaboration between SFI funded researchers and industry has also increased significantly in recent years. At present SFI is supporting 29 top-class research centres (9 CSETs and 20 SRCs) and SFI funded researchers are collaborating with over 550 industry partners, both multinational and indigenous. — Both in 2009 and 2010, IDA investments of over €500m were in research, development and innovation, and these investments are central to productivity and new business development in the multinational sector.The Exchequer allocations for 2011 from my Department to the agencies under its remit involved in encouraging innovation are as followsEnterprise Ireland — Subhead F — Research and Development is in receipt of €140.259m from my Department, (of which €131.393m is capital and €8.866m current funding).Science Foundation Ireland has a budget of €175.142m, (of which €160.8m is capital and €14.342m current).IDA has been allocated €124.577m, (of which €86m is capital and €38.577m current funds).These allocations are provided for ongoing Enterprise Agency activities aimed at encouraging innovation, and ensuring that emerging opportunities are maximized.The Government has arranged that a comprehensive spending review of existing capital and current spending will be undertaken, and it is currently ongoing.  All allocation of funding will be considered in this process, my Department will be fully engaged in that Spending Review and future funding will be determined by the outcome of this work.It will be my aim to enable the enterprise agencies under the remit of my Department to continue to support and encourage innovation and thereby help enterprise to be sustainable, develop, grow and provide jobs in this country for Ireland's workforce.
