SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the submission but the only conclusion I can draw from it is that there is now a change in culture in the regulatory regime here.  Since the appointment of Sir Andrew Large, what potential for sanctions now exists other than for administrative sanctions?  If there was a culture of overcharging, which is the same as theft, the only recourse in law is an administrative sanction or a fine.  The banks knew that was the case and carried on with the practice.  We must change from administrative to other sanctions and change the law so that where overcharging occurs on a systematic basis, those responsible do time.  If we are to effect change in the regulatory regime, that is necessary.I would like to hear more about the Minister's announcement that Sir Andrew Large has been appointed to look at the prudential supervision regime and the regulatory regime.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is one thing to assist in the appointment of a chief but given his experience, is there not a greater role for him?
