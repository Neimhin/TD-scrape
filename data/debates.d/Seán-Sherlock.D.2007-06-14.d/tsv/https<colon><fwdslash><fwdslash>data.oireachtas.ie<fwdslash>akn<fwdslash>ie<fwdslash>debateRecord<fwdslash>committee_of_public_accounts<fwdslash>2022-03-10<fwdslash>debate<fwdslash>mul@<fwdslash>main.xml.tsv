[<p eid="para_86">To continue on a similar vein to the Chairman, in respect of HSE national service plan and its relationship with the health Vote, is Mr. Reid aware of the report commissioned by the Parliamentary Budget Office?</p>]
[<p eid="para_88">Mr. Reid will be aware that the report states, “The programming of expenditure under the Health Vote was another priority of Future Health and aligning the programmes of Vote 38 with the HSE’s internal allocations would make the relationship between what the Oireachtas approves and what is spent on the ground more direct.” The key words there are “what the Oireachtas approves”. We are elected by the people and we approve the expenditure, and the HSE spends the money and has that relationship with the Department of Health and the line Minister of the day. Ultimately, there is an accountability mechanism here. The Comptroller and Auditor General holds a constitutional position. If he is making reference in his opening remarks to that specific report, that report has to be taken seriously by the HSE. It is important. Let us not make light of it. It is a vital transparency mechanism.</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">On the accountability mechanism, consider what happens when a mere mortal like me, who represents the people of Cork East, submits a parliamentary question on CAMHS, as I did in January when I sought information on the number of persons waiting to be seen by CAMHS by local health office, in tabular form, and the length of time persons were waiting to be seen. It was a very simple question and the response I got was comprehensive, which was to the credit of Mr. Ryan. The response was that the total number of persons waiting for CAMHS nationally was 3,357. When I submitted a further parliamentary question, asking for a breakdown of services provided by CAMHS, specifically the number presenting to CAMHS who were waiting for psychology services, the reply, which was from Mr. O'Regan, the head of operations, gave a universal figure of 9,554 for psychology services alone. If I break it down further in relation to CHO 4, the CHO I am most familiar with, I get a total of 682 people waiting. For psychology services, I get a figure of approximately 3,000 for CHO 4.</p>, <p eid="para_92"> What is deeply frustrating for us in representing families and children awaiting appointments or trying to get into the system of CAMHS is that it is very hard to get accurate information in real time in the Houses of the Oireachtas. When we table parliamentary questions, it is very hard to give families real-time information based on their children's needs and their expectations. I have no criticisms whatsoever of the individuals who work in CAMHS, who are trying to do their best and work through all the needs of families daily, but Mr. Reid has to acknowledge that there is a serious issue in respect of CAMHS and his datasets in respect of interrogating figures in that regard. It is Kafkaesque that systems within the HSE organisation are not talking to each other properly. If Mr. Reid cannot even come up with proper figures for me when there are glaring contradictions, how can we expect to have confidence in his approach? In fairness to him, he has taken a national lead on the Covid pandemic, but we want him to devote the same energy to dealing with CAMHS, its management and, ultimately, the delivery of services to families. We remain to be convinced that appropriate resources are being deployed. From Mr. Reid's level of management down, more needs to be done. How does he answer this critique - I do not call it a criticism - of how we as politicians interface with the service?</p>]
[<p eid="para_96">I accept the response and the distinction Ms O'Connor is making, but the universal and most important point is that we still have 3,000 children waiting.</p>, <p eid="para_97"> What is the current status of the children's disability network teams?</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">Does Ms O'Connor consider them to be working?</p>]
[<p eid="para_101">Is Ms O'Connor aware that parents are coming to Members of the Oireachtas saying they feel like they are now going through another process of incessant form-filling and that the services are moving further and further away from them? Again, it is almost Kafkaesque that they are in this vortex of constant form-filling. They feel extremely frustrated. Can Ms O'Connor sympathise and empathise with their experience of children's disability network teams so far?</p>]
[<p eid="para_104">Absolutely. I am not a specialist in this field so I rely on the information being imparted to me by the HSE. Would person-to-person intervention not have been the starting point anyway as opposed to sending people into an assessment process that some families describe as nightmarish? I am going to leave it at that because I have three minutes left in my slot.</p>, <p eid="para_105">I ask our guests to have regard to that and to be conscious of the points we are making as we reflect them for our constituents.</p>, <p eid="para_106"> What is the status of the Owenacurra Centre? I am told it is an approved centre. Will our guests explain what, in HSE speak, an "approved centre" is?</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">The Mental Health Commission is clear in its definition. It states an approved centre is intended "to provide in-patient treatment to people suffering from mental illness. The MHC maintains a register of all approved centres." The chief executive stated the HSE is going to move to close the Owenacurra Centre. Will Mr. Reid reconsider that position? I am not convinced, and I imagine I speak comfortably for all the Members of the Oireachtas who represent the Cork East constituency, there is a proper, fit-for-purpose local alternative solution to respond to the centre’s closure. Mr. Reid made reference in his opening remarks to Glenwood, but from what I can see in the planning application, that is not to be designated as an approved centre. In fact, there was no mention of the fact it would become an approved centre.</p>, <p eid="para_110"> Right now, there are 11 people who do not know where they are supposed to go, yet they have expressed a clear will and preference. Mr. Reid used the expression "will and preference". I would contend that as long as they continue to express a will and preference to stay at the Owenacurra Centre, they should be allowed to do so for as long as is necessary, in accordance with their will and preference. I do not believe our guests have presented to us a fit-for-purpose and local alternative for them. Sending them 30 km up the road is not a solution. That is not how we treat people in this day and age. If they continue to express a will and preference not to move, that must be respected. Furthermore, the moneys the HSE has spent on improving the Owenacurra Centre have to be taken into account. I understand more than €359,000 has been spent there since 2016. There is no alternative for the residents at present. Our guests have presented the Carrigaline centre as an alternative, but it is not an approved centre. The residents – 11 souls - are almost being cast out. I ask Mr. Reid to please reconsider and to have a bit of heart in respect of these people.</p>]
