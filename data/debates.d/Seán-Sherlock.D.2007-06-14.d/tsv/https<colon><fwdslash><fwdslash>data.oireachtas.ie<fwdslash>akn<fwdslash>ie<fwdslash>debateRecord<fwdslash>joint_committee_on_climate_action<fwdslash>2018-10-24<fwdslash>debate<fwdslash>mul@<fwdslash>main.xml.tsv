SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T15:00:00+01:00	Forgive me for being late. Wednesday is a day when one has to attend other committees as well. I welcome the submission, which I have read. I merely want to ask some key questions. On the theme of building capacity in relation to the LCDCs and the PPNs, communities are coming together and generating ideas about what they want to do and there is an articulation of those ideas or projects through the local authorities. I want to glean a better understanding from the Department of how it is facilitating or helping to build capacity so that we can see a greater throughput of these localised projects with a climate change theme. One specific project with which I am familiar is the IRD Duhallow project on warmer homes. I am not sure whether Mr. McCarthy is familiar with that project. It is an extremely good project whereby those who are dependent on the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment can be facilitated with a grant and the project will come out and retrofit houses for attic insulation. That is one bespoke and valuable project for the community I represent. I wonder how the Department can translate that across a wider geographical spectrum and how one builds capacity on that kind of project and other types of projects. The LCDCs and the PPNs have considerable potential to build capacity and deliver projects for everybody, and have a real impact. I want to get an understanding from the Department of that dynamic. That is my first question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T15:00:00+01:00	On the community-owned energy projects, I want to get an understanding of whether the Department has clear targets for community-owned energy projects and how it plans to facilitate more of those types of projects. Such projects have the potential to be real game-changers locally. If, arising from our deliberations here in committee we compile a report, it would be helpful if we could speak to that potential. That is the second question. In regard to planning policy, to follow up on Senator Grace O'Sullivan's point, I want to get an understanding of whether there is a need to ensure that houses in rural areas are built near settlements so as to reduce the dependency on cars. Mr. McCarthy may say that is a Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government competence but I wish merely to have the Department of Rural and Community Development's perspective on that as well.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T15:10:00+01:00	Are climate action and mitigation mapped across that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T15:20:00+01:00	There is no time for reflections.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	I love when the Dubs tell us what is worth it and what is not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	It does now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	I beg the indulgence of the Acting Chairman. I must go to the Chamber for a Topical Issue. I understand I am to speak next. May I speak when I return?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	No, that is not what I am asking. I am just anxious-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	I am just anxious that the committee would facilitate me when I come back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	I appreciate that. I am asking whether the meeting will still be in progress.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T16:30:00+01:00	Senator Mulherin should take her time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:00:00+01:00	I am grateful to have the opportunity to interact with the commissioners in the OPW. In terms of management of the State property portfolio and the built environment the Citizens' Assembly report makes a specific recommendation, for which 100% of the members voted, that the State should take a leadership role in addressing climate change through mitigation measures including, for example, retrofitting public buildings. The witnesses would have read that before coming in here today. Why is it that, according to the OPW, 79% of buildings are rated either C or D, which comprise 42% and 37%, respectively? I appreciate the point that most poorly performing buildings have exceptional electric loads, data centres and so on but can we be more ambitious about that target? Is there language that can be used to say we are looking at the 12-year window and can the OPW become more radical in getting those C and D-rated buildings up to ratings of B and A? According to the IPCC report, the trajectory now is completely different and that must give rise to more radical policies by Government and, by extension, the Departments. I want to get a sense of urgency from the witnesses or a sense that these new limit warnings are scary. I would love for us to be able to write a report that says we are satisfied that the OPW, which manages the State property portfolio, is moving more radically towards BER ratings of A and B.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:00:00+01:00	On CFRAM, I am from the great county of Cork. Deputy Eamon Ryan's people were baptised in the River Lee. I was baptised in the Blackwater, metaphorically speaking. We do speak about flood defences and there is very clear evidence of structural works on the Munster Blackwater at Fermoy and Mallow, which are phenomenally successful. For anybody who has any doubts about whether demountable walls work there is incontrovertible proof that they do. Notwithstanding that, the problem for migratory fish and so on, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan has referred, is a slightly different issue, not quite pertinent to this one because it relates to a fish pass in disrepair and is not necessarily in the witnesses' remit. It is important to put that on the record. There are 118 flood relief schemes and flood relief programmes were always designed with the 100 year flood in mind. I was formerly a mayor of my town and when we went through the process we were told we were designing for the 100 year flood. I fail to understand Mr. Adamson's intervention on the planning, maybe I missed something in the dialogue. Have we now surpassed the 100 year flood mark or benchmark in planning for flooding events? Should we now be using agricultural land to slow down flooding and should we be paying farmers who are on flood plains some sort of compensation and telling them not to build on their land, not to plant or graze and allow for natural drainage schemes to take place? That would be a structural solution to flooding and a more natural solution that is not just engineering but another solution in terms of land use.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	I have one last question. Did I hear the witness correctly when he said that the cost of a Thames-type barrier structure for Cork would be €1 billion? If that is the figure I heard, has the Office of Public Works, OPW, arrived at it by doing some scenario planning or engineering a solution? The witness did not pluck the figure of €1 billion out of the air. The OPW must have had some internal discussions on that. There is angst in Cork city, which I do not share at this juncture. I differ with my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this one but I have an open mind. As I understand it, the OPW is moving towards a demountable solution. I would like some clarification on that point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	Where was the OPW going to put it? Would it be outside Spike Island or by Blackrock Castle?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	Sorry-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	It has a major impact on the whole Lee valley and-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	It is quite pertinent to-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	I apologise.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-24T17:10:00+01:00	Where exactly is the proposed location?
