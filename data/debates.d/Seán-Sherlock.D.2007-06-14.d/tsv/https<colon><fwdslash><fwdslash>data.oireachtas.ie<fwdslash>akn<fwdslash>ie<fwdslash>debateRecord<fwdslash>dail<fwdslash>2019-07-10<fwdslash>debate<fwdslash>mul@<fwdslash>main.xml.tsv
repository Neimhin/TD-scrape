[<p eid="para_1096">We too support the legislation. With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's permission, I will read into the record the entirety of correspondence I received last night from the Justice for Magdalenes Research, JFMR, group. The group stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1097"> We in Justice for Magdalenes Research (JFMR) are writing to express our concerns about the serious shortcomings in the health and social care provided to Magdalene survivors to date and to suggest that the Dáil use this legislative opportunity to fundamentally amend the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions (RWRCI) Act 2015 (in more ways than the Government proposes) so that the health and social care recommended by Judge John Quirke in 2013 is actually provided to all survivors under the Magdalene <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. </p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1098"> The Government's Bill simply seeks to add women who worked as children in Magdalene Laundries while registered on the rolls of adjacent institutions to the existing health and social care aspects of the Magdalene <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. However, we in JFMR have repeatedly pointed out - and we have been joined by healthcare professionals in so doing - that the care services currently provided under the RWRCI Act 2015 are not compliant with Judge John Quirke's recommendations. </p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1099"> We have raised the problem of healthcare provision to Magdalene numerous times since the RWRCI Act 2015 was enacted, including in writing to Ministers for Justice and Department of Justice officials [and the letter goes on to quote various dates in that regard]. </p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_1100"> On 25th February 2016 JFMR wrote to the National Director of Primary Care at the HSE to ask for written clarification of all ways in which Magdalene survivors' entitlements under the RWRCI Act card differ from those already available under the standard medical card. We received an acknowledgment letter on 15th March 2016 but have no received no substantive response to date.</p>, <p eid="para_1101"> I echo the points made by Deputy Ó Laoghaire in respect of dental, ophthalmic and aural services, psychotherapy for survivors, access to counselling and psychotherapy for family members, and access to complementary therapies. There are issues in respect of whether services as per the recommendations are to be provided. It is the understanding of JFMR that they are not being provided.</p>, <p eid="para_1102"> Given that we have just recently read the amendments, I seek clarification from the Minister and his officials on the wording for the provision of dental, ophthalmic and aural services, which will be an addition to section 2, and on referrals made by registered medical practitioners. I also seek clarification in respect of subsection (d) in amendment No. 1, which has just been brought before the House, in respect of the paragraphs relating to complementary therapies and such other services as may be prescribed. I ask that the Minister have regard to the correspondence that we - and, I presume, he and his officials - received last night. Will the concerns outlined in the correspondence be addressed in the context of the amendments the Minister has proposed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1112">I may have inadvertently said there were amendments to this Bill before the House this evening but I withdraw that comment. It was a mistake on my part. I accept the Minister's comments and thank him.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1120">The Labour Party supports the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1155">Is it appropriate in ten seconds or less to express some gratitude to people?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1157">I acknowledge the work of former Deputy Clare Daly in respect of the Bill and the work of Dr. Jo Murphy-Lawless, now retired, who was an excellent proponent of this legislation. There were too many other women to mention. The impact of the subject matter, as articulated by people such as Vicky Conway in <i>The Irish Times</i> of late, had a tremendous effect on all of us. I acknowledge those women who have passed away. We think of them as we promulgate the legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1414">As a Minister of State, I accompanied Deputy Flanagan, then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, throughout both iterations of the Stormont House talks. It is perhaps apposite that Deputy Flanagan is now here as the Minister for Justice implementing some of the outworking of that agreement through the presentation of the legislation before the House tonight.</p>, <p eid="para_1415"> As part of that process, we looked closely at North-South co-operation at that time. Stormont House was an omnibus agreement that dealt with welfare, public infrastructure such as roads, north western gateways and flags. Most important, it dealt with the very legacy issues we are talking about tonight.</p>, <p eid="para_1416"> The Labour Party supports the Bill. I would have liked more consideration and briefings with officials from the Department of Justice and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to receive greater knowledge about the present context in which the legislation is being presented. That notwithstanding, it is vital that we push on with our commitments in those agreements and that is why the Labour Party supports the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_1417">We welcome that the Garda Commissioner can enter into co-operation agreements with non-police or law enforcement bodies outside the State.</p>, <p eid="para_1418"> Whether it is done on the island of Ireland, with people on the island of Ireland partaking in these processes, or whether we elicit the help of external people, we need to deal with these issues as they will not go away. Legacy issues and matters, such as the creation of the historical investigations unit and the independent commission on information retrieval, must all be dealt with. Anything which supports that process is worthy of support.</p>, <p eid="para_1419"> I reiterate our support of the Bill and acknowledge the words of the Minister on the vacuum in Northern Ireland at present and, to be fair to him, he was one of the architects of the Stormont House Agreement. One is always hopeful that we can reach some accommodation under the ambit of the two Governments' sponsorship and that we can get back to a position where we can deal with these issues on the ground through proper structures and that haste is made to set them up that we can move on and deal with the legacy issues. The Bill is part of that process.</p>]
