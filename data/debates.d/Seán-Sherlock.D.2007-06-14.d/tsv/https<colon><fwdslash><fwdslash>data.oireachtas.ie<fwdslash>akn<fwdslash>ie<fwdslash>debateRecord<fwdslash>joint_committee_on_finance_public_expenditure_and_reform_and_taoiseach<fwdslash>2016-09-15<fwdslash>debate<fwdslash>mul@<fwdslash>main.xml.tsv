SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T11:50:00+01:00	I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee. I want to drill down to this issue of data. It seems there is not perfect knowledge in terms of how the industry operates. We do not have perfect knowledge except through the reports we have from the PIAB. Its submission to the committee gave the average award from 2009-15, which was approximately €23,000. The PIAB submission stated there is:...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases. Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact on insurance premiums is difficult to establish...The Irish Brokers Association, IBA, submission states the same thing. I am trying to grapple with the issue. Insurance Ireland through its public utterances in the past 48 hours or so has been quoting from "independent data sources", from the Injuries Board figures, from the bodily injuries review published by the Central Bank and from the OECD report which states that Ireland is the eighth most expensive country in which to enforce a contract, given the average award of a Circuit Court increased by 21.2% in 2015, following a 13.5% increase in 2014. The point I am getting at is that I do understand why Insurance Ireland is not sharing data. First, I am making an assertion that is it not, so the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong and I would like to get the IBA position on that. If we had perfect knowledge in regard to all of the claims, we would be able to drill down to the reason people's premiums have gone up by 70% to 80% or why some people are not being insured at all. To give an example I have used before, if a premium goes from €500 on a Thursday to a cost of €800, which is a surcharge of €300, what percentage of that €300 is what I call super-normal profit and what percentage is attributable to the cost of the historical decrease in insurance and the provisioning that is necessary? The witnesses should correct me if my analysis of the situation is wrong. I am directing my questions in the first instance specifically to the IBA. The second element I need an answer on is in regard to Zenith. There seems to be a contradictory position between what Insurance Ireland is saying and what Zenith is saying. If I understand Mr. Humphreys correctly - he is on the public record so I have no issue about naming him here - he is saying Zenith is exiting the market because it does not have access to proper data. If so, I would like to have an assessment or a view from the IBA as to why that is the case or what its take is on that. I was very taken by a point in the IBA submission, which states: "All gardaí should have APNR equipment so they can scan registrations to see if they are insured, and the requirement for insurance discs should be abolished." If we think about that logically, the driver gets the insurance disc in the post and slots it into the pouch on the window, and the technology now exists to scan or copy it in order to create a false disc. If we are depending on a garda at a checkpoint with hundreds of vehicles passing through to intimately examine the disc, there is a case to be made for the APNR model so this can be based on checking of registrations, and we can look at the enforcement procedures thereafter. What this committee is trying to do is to drill down into what it is that we need to recommend by way of solutions. I will come back to Ms Dowling in the second part of the meeting as she suggests there is a potential legislative solution to this. Those are my opening remarks and I will come back in again later, if I may.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	Is Mr. Carty telling us he has access to the data?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	I just want to drill down into this. If Mr. Carty has access to risk intelligence, presumably that forms the pricing mechanism.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	I think it is best that we make this distinction now. We are beginning to drill down into the nub of this now. If the insurance I am paying for suddenly increases by 20% or 30%, I will scratch my head. Most people will accept that historically, it might have come down for a certain demographic. Where is the loading? Mr. Carty has referred to the SFCR. If I am interpreting him correctly, he hinted that the corporates are rejigging balance sheets and preparing for the Solvency II rules. It seems to me that the victims in this, if I can use that word, are the people who are driving cars in Ireland. Regardless of the age of their vehicles or their own ages, their risk profile has not increased over a short period of time. It does not matter if their cars are three months old or 30 years old. If they have passed the NCT, they are roadworthy. This is the point. It seems to me that ordinary people are becoming victims or pawns in a bigger corporate game. There is a bit of re-provisioning going on. There is pressure to adhere to the SFCR rules or the Solvency II rules. There is a bit of naked profiteering going on as well. This is why the joint committee wants to drill down into the issue of public knowledge. The market is not perfectly competitive. If it were, anyone who wanted to enter the market tomorrow would have perfect knowledge of all elements of data. The Injuries Board is telling us one story. As it is a public body, we absolutely believe in the veracity of its figures. Not everybody is going through the Injuries Board. Why are the insurance companies settling? We know there was a constitutional case relating to the right to legal representation. I have sympathy for the IBA position in respect of transparency around the insurance system and the measures that can be taken. Everyone is saying the same thing with regard to data. We do not have perfect knowledge from the insurance industry. Maybe we have to wait for Insurance Ireland to come in later on to drill down into that element of it. Until we have that, we are really at nothing here.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	On that-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	Before he comes in, I would like to say it appears that the data are proprietorial, in effect. It is questionable whether we can legislate to make that data available to all comers. I would welcome a view on that. If the data are of a comprehensive nature, and if they profile every single purchaser of insurance, we can crack the nut here by getting access to them. That is really what we are trying to drill down into.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	I thank Ms Dowling for coming in because I think she has given us an angle with which to question Insurance Ireland on the issue of data. I suppose what I want to ask is whether it is possible.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:00:00+01:00	If it is supposed to be a perfectly competitive market, those who want to enter the market should have access to all the information they need to do so. If there is a blocking mechanism, there is a suggestion that cartel-like behaviour could be at play. We will have an opportunity later to discuss whether that is the case. I want to get a sense from Ms Dowling and the representatives of the IBA of whether they believe this sector is operating in a cartel-like manner. If Insurance Ireland is not giving us access to all the data we require in the interests of transparency and to enable the Oireachtas to make a set of recommendations that can potentially be legislated on, it is arguable that we are on the back foot.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T12:20:00+01:00	We have to distinguish between Mr. Carty as an underwriter and the IBA position for the purposes of this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:20:00+01:00	I want to come at the data issue from a different angle. Let us start at the beginning, because the CCPC has said it is going to open up an investigation into, to use Ms O'Leary's term, the issue of pricing predictions or intentions that "may result in a degree of unspoken co-ordination". What does the expression "unspoken co-ordination" mean, in layman's terms? Could the witness speak to the punter who has seen a 50% increase in their insurance premium? What does "unspoken co-ordination" mean?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:20:00+01:00	What Mr. Kenny is telling me, as somebody who has just seen an increase in their own premium, in layman's terms is that this could be adjudicated or there could be concerns around cartel-like behaviour in that instance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:20:00+01:00	Mr. Kenny used the analogy of the smoke-filled rooms. If one fast-forwards to modern language, it is air-conditioned rooms in glass towers, on the 15th floor, but it is the same type of behaviour, where an influence is being brought to bear on the market in the context of pricing. Whatever way one parses the language, what Mr. Kenny is essentially telling us, on behalf of a statutory agency or body, is that there is a concern about cartel-like behaviour. Let us not be too prescriptive on the word "cartel" as Mr. Kenny has elucidated it to us. That is de facto cartel-like behaviour, where one is influencing the price determination for a project.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:20:00+01:00	The Chairman has raised the issue of data. We know what the Injuries Board pays out, but there is a whole indeterminable figure that we do not know in respect of settlements. We do not know the true cost of settlements because there is not perfect knowledge. If the CCPC is investigating this without having access to the three so-called databases, it could be argued - correct me if I am wrong - that it is on the back foot in respect of this investigation. Unless it can get access to what is on Insurance Ireland's databases, then, short of a legislative change, Insurance Ireland could block the CCPC out of that and not give it access to the database. I do not know how the legislation could be changed. Ms O'Leary alluded to this matter earlier, and forgive me if I am incorrect, but if there are any number of insurance houses in this country and they are all under an umbrella organisation and not everybody has access to the databases vis-à-vis settlements out of court - about which figure there is no perfect knowledge, generally speaking - then how is the CCPC going to crack this nut? What is it going to do? Where are the powers of compellability in respect of that data from the CCPC's point of view? If it does get access to that data, what can it do to assure consumers that their premiums will reduce as a result? I have been using the following analogy for the past few days: if my insurance premium has gone from €500 to €800, which is a €300 increase, what proportion of that €300 increase is reprovisioning or rebalancing?What proportion of that is to deal with the Solvency II rules or the financial systems control review report? What proportion of it is absolute and naked profiteering? Where will the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission come in to shed light on that for the people we represent?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	Forgive me, I have no wish to confuse the issue. From a statutory point of view, does the commission have the power to go into any insurance house? The commission is investigating the sector, effectively. Does it have the power or remit to go in to any insurance house, any of the big names? Three of the biggest names in the world in this sector begin with the letter A. Can representatives of the commission go in to those houses and explain that they work for the CCCP and want access to all the data on pay-outs? We know what the Injuries Board is doing. There is perfect knowledge of its activity and the average level of claims. Can commission representatives ask these firms about what is on the databases?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	The commission obviously does believe that. Otherwise, it would not have notified of the fact that it is undertaking an investigation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	Is that not the nub of it? We are talking about huge increases in premia. The commission has received complaints. We already know the scenarios. Let us suppose a person's car has an NCT certificate, he is over a certain age, the car is roadworthy and he has never been a risk before. Then, all of a sudden, he is paying a 50% increase in his car insurance. There is no justifiable reason for it if insurance pricing is based on risk and there is no change to the risk. Then, obviously, there is behaviour within the industry that is determining the investigation. Can the commission compel the insurance industry to yield onto Caesar their databases, which show the level of claims that are settled out of court? We, as ordinary citizens, have no knowledge of this. That is where the gap in data materialises. If we are talking about absolute transparency, then we need to have access to the data. Now, from where I am sitting, there is only one relevant entity, aside from the Central Bank reports and the Injuries Board. It is opaque and there is no perfect knowledge relating to the data.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	Can the CCPC ask that question?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	From the consumer's point of view, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has issued summonses to the motor insurance providers. The commission press release clearly states that there was a signalling of price increases. If the commission cannot get access to the reasoning behind the price increases, even on issues like re-balancing, provisioning or the historical reduction in premia in recent years, then what does a successful outcome of the commission investigation look like, from the point of view of the consumer?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	Let us not couch language here. The people watching this online want a simple answer. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is going in now to take a look at the insurance sector, as it relates to motorists. That will give people some degree of comfort, but it will only give them comfort if they know there is an outcome that results in a reduction in premium prices.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	What does that mean? What is the delta on the price?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	The commission can make a determination that there was an increase in price as a result of what criteria?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	In effect, there is no justice or restorative function of the commission in that regard. The commission can make a "Yes" or "No" statement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	Essentially, as far as the commission goes, this investigation could take how long, roughly?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	We live in the political world. With all due respect, I am not satisfied with hearing that speed is the friend of success. The people watching this want to know. The commission is a statutory body and one of the commissioners, Mr. Kenny, is before the committee. Can Mr. Kenny give us a timeframe by which the investigation will be completed? What could the outcome potentially be after the investigations? If the commission makes findings against the insurance industry, what recourse does the commission have? Mr. Kenny has not given us a timeline. He has said months but we need to be more definitive. If it runs to court proceedings after that, then this could conceivably take years. I am pressing Mr. Kenny because if we have to wait for the CCPC to make a determination but the industry has already signalled a 20% increase for next year, then it seems to me the firms are not going to stop that increase pending the investigation the commission intends to carry out. Therefore, the consumer will still end up paying more. Not only will the consumer be subject to the 2016 increases, he will also be front-loaded with 2017 increases as well while this investigation is going on. Can the commission stop the increases while the investigation is going on?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:30:00+01:00	With all due respect, Mr. Kenny cannot say that definitively. That is a rather subjective statement. The proof of the pudding in that case will become evident. As Mr. Kenny has said, there is potentially a year in this. He cannot say for sure that premia will not actually increase as a result of the fact that the commission has signalled that it will undertake an investigation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T14:40:00+01:00	I will close out on this point. What we are hearing is that the commission will look at one element of what is effectively a much bigger picture, if I am to sum up its contribution. As the Chairman articulated, there is still the issue of data, of having perfect knowledge within the sector. It is clear that in the absence of perfect knowledge, we, as legislators, are in the dark. If we are expected by the consumer to make a set of recommendations, until we have access to that data and those databases, in terms of the qualitative analysis of that data, the industry can continue to behave as it has behaved.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	Obviously not in the Irish market - it is anonymised and shared but only among those who are in the largest organisation, which is Insurance Ireland.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	We will have an opportunity to investigate that later.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	To corroborate what the Chairman is saying, the Injuries Board has stated that there is no public information available in respect of overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries as the only figures that have been made public do not contain any information on the numbers or cost of directly settled cases. It stated that without access to this information, a full picture of the impact of personal injury claims on insurance premiums is difficult to establish. The witnesses can tell us that the commission is looking at the notified intention to increase pricing but that is still only one element of it. After this submission, we still will not know whether there is a legislative basis that can be provided or whether a case can be made for legislating for perfect knowledge within the industry aside from whether or not one is a member that is locked in or out of Insurance Ireland or whether one is a broker, an underwriter, a small indigenous insurance house or a large international insurance house. It remains the case that if there is a proprietorial element to that data, there could be all kinds of constitutional provisions around that in respect of who owns the data, who minds it and how one interprets it. We can have all sorts of assessments and can make a rough adjudication on what is in the book of quantum. We have already heard that the book of quantum needs to be updated. Ms Dorothea Dowling told us that one can go from €400,000 maxima, if I am not mistaken - she mentioned an injury to a quadriplegic level - to a minor injury like a soft tissue injury, add a percentage and extrapolate an award from that. Perhaps we have to wait and see what Insurance Ireland tells us but I am trying to ascertain here whether or not we can provide a legislative base to compel the sector to anonymise the data and give it up. There is separation of powers but that would at least provide guidance for the Judiciary, where something is not settled through the Injuries Board, to allow it to quantify the extent of the damages so that there is no back-loading or front-loading on the cost of premiums. No matter what way one parses this, there must be an element of profiteering here if a premium increases overnight by 50%, 60% or 70% or if certain people have been locked out of the market when by any objective analysis their level of risk has not increased. My level of risk has not increased from 9 to 10 September when I renewed my car insurance. Do the witnesses see my point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	Can the commission adjudicate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	From a competition law perspective, can the commission adjudicate on the nature of the sharing of that information intra industry as opposed to the public domain in terms of the deliberations we have in this committee?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T15:20:00+01:00	Someone will correct me if I am wrong but to reinforce what the Chairman said, Zenith, which I can name because it is on the public record, is telling us through the Irish Brokers Association that it was de facto locked out of a process of data sharing relating to the market.We are told there are three fundamental databases, but it appears that not everybody operating within the market, or seeking to become a member, can access them. It is like a club, I suppose. If somebody is in Insurance Ireland, he or she is away on a hack, so to speak, as the person would know the pricing mechanisms and how to game the pricing systems. I use the word "game" as the person would have perfect knowledge of reserves and how much of a profit can be made. Even taking historical factors into account, we were told there was a reduction in the market for premiums, with certain players trying to get to the top of the market or have the most market share, resulting in a reduction in premium costs, but all of a sudden there is a reset going on. If that is happening, one does not set a price based on an intention to earn super-normal profits. The price is clearly being reset based on the fact that there must be resetting of the market to meet reserves, the Solvency II rules and what we spoke of earlier. It would appear the insurance sector is confining its behaviour to a certain number of larger firms, to the detriment of other players. On the face of it, that is what appears to be happening. They are using Setanta as cover for that. They are using the dysfunction in the market as a resetting mechanism to profiteer. That is the theory here. It comes back to whether we can legislate to get access to data. Ms O'Leary was beginning to elucidate the point that there is a difference between what happens internally within the market and what is in the public domain. That distinction has been made.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:00:00+01:00	Through the Chair, I ask Senator Horkan to forgive me for cutting across him. Who talks about data without knowing what it is?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:00:00+01:00	Mr. Horan should be specific because if he is laying that at the door of members, I would say bí cúramach because it is an integral part of what we are talking about here today, about parsing out the issue of data.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:10:00+01:00	I thank the witnesses for coming into us today. There has been a focus on data. I am looking at this from the point of view of whether the market is competitive. Whether it is perfectly competitive or not remains to be seen. There is still a fundamental question about whether there is perfect knowledge around the market. We all recognise there has to be a surplus on every premium derived by a company. That is a given but we are finding it difficult to reconcile the extent to which premia have increased. It is a steep, unaffordable rise. If insurance companies are pricing risk and liability and if by any reasonable, objective analysis the individual motorist's personal circumstances have not changed, the car has passed its NCT test and nothing has changed from the motorist's point of view yet they are incurring a cost of 30%, 40% or 50% they are asking themselves, "What is going on here?". Most people will accept the argument around the resetting of the market to adhere to rules and provisioning. The witnesses' opening statement outlined that the price of premiums had reduced significantly over quite a number of years. What most people cannot reconcile is the extent of the increases. I have listened carefully to what Mr. Horan is saying about the data. He speaks about the private motor insurance statistics report in 2015, the IIDS, the ANPR and so on. In the Personal Injuries Assessment Board's submission to us it states there is:...no public information available relating to overall numbers and costs of claims for personal injuries and the only figures that were made public did not contain any information on the costs of directly settled cases. Without access to that information, a full picture of the impact [of personal injury claims] on insurance premiums is difficult to establish.If we take Insurance Ireland's submission before us today and its willingness to seek a solution to this issue and layer on the fact that it is saying there is adequate data available to make an assessment of the market, why is it that the PIAB, which is a statutory body, is telling the Houses of the Oireachtas there is not perfect knowledge? How do the witnesses reconcile these statements? 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:20:00+01:00	What does scoping out an exercise mean? If Insurance Ireland provides statistics to the Central Bank then yes, there are statistics, but the issue is how they are mined for quantitative analysis of the data so that decisions can be made. Will the scoping exercise, whatever that is, result in transparency around the cost of a premium? There is no breakdown of the cost of an average motorist's premium. People accept the insurance companies must make a surplus on the premium and accept, to a certain extent, a rejigging or resetting of provisioning, but they do not accept the stark increase. The witnesses still have not explained this, not even in their opening submission. There is nothing in the opening submission, with all due respect, or in the subsequent replies which answers for the ordinary motorist the question as to why premiums have increased. The witnesses have not spoken to us about behaviours in the insurance industry regarding the settling of claims - whether the insurance companies interrogate fully every claim that comes before them, or whether they settle them just to get them off the desk and out the door. We do not know who the members of Insurance Ireland are. The witnesses state that it is representative of 95% of the domestic market but, presumably, all of the big insurance houses are members of Insurance Ireland also. We know it is a not-for-profit organisation. We are all intelligent people here, presumably, so we know Insurance Ireland gets its riding instructions from those paying subscriptions. The question is whether Insurance Ireland is here to speak for all of its members, including the big insurance houses. We now hear there will be an investigation by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, but we are none the wiser more than half an hour into these proceedings. I am still ignorant as to why there has been such a stark increase. The witnesses state that the data is available, but clearly it is not.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:20:00+01:00	I apologise for cutting across Mr. Thompson, but now we are drilling down into the nub of this. He states that the data is proprietary but, at the same time, he states that Insurance Ireland is yielding up sufficient data to statutory organisations and the Central Bank. Effectively, he is giving the impression, with regard to its intervention, that there is perfect knowledge in the sector because he stated it has the IIDS and InsuranceLink, notwithstanding the ANPR issues, and the private motor statistics with the Central Bank. Insurance Ireland is creating an impression that it is yielding the data unto Caesar, so to speak, but it is not telling us, in very real and simple terms, why the increase is happening. We accept a certain degree of provisioning and resetting in the market, and we accept that the insurance companies need to make a degree of profit, but not to this extent. We do not have visibility as premium holders of the level of profit that will be made and the stark increases that have been made. This is the real issue for motorists. To be fair about it, the risk profile for the vast bulk of motorists by any actuarial standard has not actually increased. We do not have perfect knowledge on what insurance companies settle out of court on the steps with solicitors. The witnesses will not give us this information.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:20:00+01:00	The reality contradicts this. If I am to be very frank and blunt, insurance is a hard-nosed business and is highly competitive. The companies have shareholders and a bottom line. The witnesses cannot come into the Oireachtas and state that there are eight aspirations or solutions to this and that the sixth is to reduce legal costs, when we know, anecdotally and factually, that insurance companies settle out of court without investigating to a large extent whether a claim in the first instance was fraudulent, or where there is a history of repetitive cases involving people who are up and down the steps before it goes into the courtroom. There is a culture of settling before going to court, where the case could be interrogated properly, and the industry is not taking on the fraudsters. The companies have realised it is much easier to just settle and get cases off the books and off the table. The second solution suggested is tackling whiplash. The witnesses have stated that eight out of ten motor insurance claims in Ireland are for whiplash and awards here are three times those in the UK. They stated that premiums are a function of the costs of claims, so high awards mean higher premiums. However, they did not tell us the percentage of these whiplash claims which are settled without going through an Injuries Board process or are settled outside the doors of the court. Until we can drill down into this information it appears that the insurance industry will ride the storm, apply the further 20% increase in the premiums already signalled to the market, and go through the investigation with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and pay lip service to what we are trying to achieve, which is lower costs for motorists. It is plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.There is no evidence here that the industry is really making an honest effort, beyond aspirational language, to reduce premiums. 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-15T16:30:00+01:00	There is an inverse principle at work here. Mr. Thompson has said that the industry is settling more and tackling fraudulent claims, but it is increasing premiums at the same time. It does not figure. I wish to go back to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, statement which argues that there is no public information available on the overall number and cost of claims. The PIAB has access to the same report that Insurance Ireland furnished to the Central Bank. One would also assume that because it interfaces with the insurance industry all the time, it has access to InsuranceLink or can get a sense from Insurance Ireland of the integrated information data service, IIDS, for example, yet there is a contradiction between its position and that of Insurance Ireland on the availability of information.
