SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:30:00+01:00	I ask the Chairman for his forbearance at the outset, because we will operate a question-and-answer format while I have the floor.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:30:00+01:00	Yes. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new role. I have a few policy-related questions. He said in his speech that he would fulfil the existing level of service and there would be no policy change. I want to flesh this out. Does he mean the status quo will obtain from 2015 to 2016 and there will be no new departures in terms of policy implementation, particularly for the management of heritage? I note that the Minister of State referred to heritage services. He mentioned very specific sites and talked about co-operating with Fáilte Ireland on initiatives such as Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. A pot of approximately €65 million has been made available for capital projects by Fáilte Ireland. How will that money be disbursed? Will it be disbursed outside the keynote sites that are normally referred to in terms of tourist attractions? He referred specifically to Kilmainham Gaol, Glendalough, Clonmacnoise and Killarney National Park. There are other sites that I would advocate, such as Doneraile Wildlife Park in Cork, which has approximately 450,000 visitors per annum. Will there be a change in policy that would allow such sites to be marketed along with either the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East? I want to get a sense from him of how he views heritage sites, tourism potential and job creation in rural areas. There are sites that are a little off the beaten track but they are no less important than the big keynote sites. With regard to CFRAM, Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the Cork project and insurance issues. The Munster Blackwater, and specifically the flood alleviation works that were carried out in Fermoy and Mallow, are keynote OPW projects that have delivered significant benefits. My next issue is demountable walls. Has an actuarial analysis been done to assess the cost of insurance in cases in which demountable walls have been put in place? There is clear evidence that the presence of demountable walls alleviates flooding. I do not mean to be too parochial but I am referring to the Munster Blackwater, where the OPW did a stellar job in two specific towns. There is proof that demountable walls work because they have stopped towns from being flooded. That should, from an actuarial point of view, have the knock-on effect of driving down insurance premiums. We need to be more vociferous and stronger when sending a message to the insurance companies about such issues. In my opinion, insurance companies are using the excuse that there is a lack of evidence to support demountable works or that there is some actuarial analysis or mitigating risk factor associated with demountable walls. Perhaps this is an issue that the Minister of State could take up. Can I have a specific start date for the Bandon and Skibbereen projects?  My next point also concerns CFRAM. It could be argued that the OPW maps trawl well beyond certain curtilages, especially in villages with arterial drains, minor rivers or streams. Even if one were to assess the 100-year flood risk in certain places, the analysis would drive up the cost of insurance for the people who live there. Has CFRAM looked at towns and villages that have tributaries? Has CFRAM adopted a belt-and-braces approach to alleviating flood risk in such places? The area for further assessment identifies the risk. How does CFRAM measure the risk? Does it use the usual formula of the 100-year flood? Is it less than that? I thank the Minister of State for his statement. Notwithstanding his statement that there will be no policy change, are there specific issues related to the timeframe in which to deliver projects? What does he wish to achieve, on his watch as Minister of State responsible for the OPW, in terms of heritage, the management of natural resources and flood alleviation? I would like him to outline, in his own words, his vision for the Department. Have functions been clearly delineated and delegated to him in terms of the management of his budget?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:40:00+01:00	Is the Minister of State chairing the interdepartmental group?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:40:00+01:00	Yes. My point about flood mapping is that if one takes CFRAM and a small village with a stream going through it where there has not been a flood within living memory, the insurance maps will show clearly at present that the curtilage of the stream is very wide and the area is deemed to be a flood plain. I might not have explained myself clearly. When the CFRAM study on the villages and towns we are talking about sees the light of day there must be a realistic mechanism built in such that one looks at the 100-year risk. If a village has not flooded, or the stream has not burst its banks, in living memory, and people are paying an extra premium for their insurance because the mapping is such that the curtilage is very wide either side of the bank, then I contend that the OPW or the Minister of State must look at the issue because it is driving up the cost of insurance and some places are uninsurable as a result. Barryscourt Castle in Cork is another prime OPW site. We all acknowledge the excellence with which the OPW carries out its work in terms of care, maintenance and enhancement, because it has spent considerable resources recently enhancing such sites off the beaten track. Barryscourt Castle in Carrigtwohill is on a main thoroughfare and it is an example of wonderful work conducted by the OPW but it has been closed for some time and it is still closed. If the Minister of State cannot respond to me on the issue today perhaps he could revert to me.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:40:00+01:00	It is being rewired. Do we know when it is opening?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:40:00+01:00	I appreciate that because it is another key site for the south and it would be fantastic if it could be open this summer but I think we are too late.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:40:00+01:00	I thank Mr. McMahon.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:50:00+01:00	Will the Minister of State comment on his delegated functions? Have they been clearly defined and is there a very clear budget? Will the Minister of State have absolute autonomy and policy control over his budget? Has it been notified to the Dáil at this stage? I am not aware that it has been.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T09:50:00+01:00	The Minister of State is not being facetious.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T10:40:00+01:00	There is a further point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T10:40:00+01:00	In terms of learning about how the OPW operates as an organisation, it might be helpful as well to distinguish between the role of the Minister of State and the commissioners in terms of how the law operates regarding the autonomy of the commissioners in respect of making decisions. Perhaps that should be dealt with in this forum, even today, to give us an insight into the role of commissioners because it arguably differs from other Departments because commissioners are appointed. It would be helpful for people who are watching these committee proceedings to get a two or three-minute insight into the role of the commissioners in respect of how the policy of the OPW plays out.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:40:00+01:00	I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to the committee. My questions concern the Vote before us, but before I put them I will make a broad point about the need for this committee to make time for a discussion on the summer economic statement and the recent report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Notwithstanding the time constraints we face today, I would welcome the opportunity to have a broader discussion on the very macroeconomic issues that affect us all, particularly how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform fits into that firmament, because there are legitimate questions relating to the summer economic statement concerning the costings for 2017 of recent announcements such as the Revised Estimate for health and the €200 million local investment fund for local authorities. On the latter, we need an opportunity to interrogate the modalities of that scheme and its cost in terms of public expenditure but also in respect of-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:40:00+01:00	I appreciate that. Other issues include medium-term objectives and the stability programme update. These are all issues that this committee needs to have time to discuss with the Minister, so I appreciate that and I thank the Minister. The EU referendum in Great Britain is on the horizon. In respect of subheads A6 and A8 and the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, which is within the Minister's Department, we have given a lot of resources and time to ensuring that this North-South body is adequately funded and that the PEACE programme is funded adequately from an EU perspective. Has the Minister a view on the effect on those programmes if the UK exits the EU? Subhead A8 concerns the Ireland Wales Territorial Co-operation Programme. I am very worried that if the UK exits the EU it will have a profound effect on programmes operating on a North-South basis from both a social and an economic point of view. I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that.  In respect of procurement, I note that reference was made to savings of €80 million to €100 million and previous savings. I have a worry about Irish SMEs. I note that there has been a lot of work done with regard to the local enterprise offices and "meet the buyer" events and so on, and savings have been made. Has the Department calculated whether more Irish SMEs have taken up this opportunity and whether pre-existing Irish companies and SMEs have been crowded out by virtue of the fact that they lack the economies of scale required to compete for business? I make specific reference to the education sector, where there is anecdotal evidence that companies that supplied arts and crafts supplies, books and other products in the education sphere feel they will not be able to retain the market share they had and are being crowded out by the new regime for procuring savings. I do not necessarily need an answer to that today. I am just putting down a marker, and we might have a further discussion on it because there are companies that are feeling a bit of pressure in that space. Is PeoplePoint operating at full capacity? Have the individual line Departments' HR and payment functions migrated to PeoplePoint in a seamless fashion? We all acknowledge that there will be a lag on that and that there will be issues that must be dealt with, but I would like to hear the Minister's perspective on whether PeoplePoint is up and running and whether it is responding to individual workers' queries in a timely fashion.  In respect of Vote 19, provision is made for issues such as prisoner complaints, clinical judgments and direct provision to be dealt with by the Office of the Ombudsman. I understand it has a budget of €9.7 million. Will the Office of the Ombudsman have an expanded role? Is the cost of this being met in respect of the potential need for increased personnel to deal with an expanded service?  I have a bugbear concerning our own services here. Our own IT infrastructure has not migrated to the cloud. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing a very good job of ensuring that build-to-share and cloud service platforms are built through the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. I note the statement relating to data mining and so on. Is this is a matter for further discussion somewhere down the line? We could discuss how the Oireachtas operates in respect of our own ICT infrastructure and making loose systems available, because the systems we are operating at the moment are a bit anachronistic and arcane and might need to be looked at. That is a very minor issue, but I said I would take the opportunity to raise it with the Minister while he was here.  I welcome the comments on the opening up of a dialogue with the public sector unions on the commission. The Minister made a very clear statement about how any sudden elimination of the FEMPI measures is not feasible. I was hoping for more time today to discuss the summer economic statement, the fiscal space and the new moneys that appear to have been made available, because I wonder whether there is scope to accelerate the unwinding of FEMPI, given the increased resources that would appear to be available as an outcome of the summer economic statement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	Does that include Departments?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	Have all Departments migrated to this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	I am not liking what I am hearing.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	I am not criticising anybody working within our IT system here. The system is what it is. If Government is talking about open data, open government and the system we operate as a parliament, compared with others such as the Estonian parliament, which has moved lock, stock and barrel into the cloud, then - while I note there may be security issues, with firewalling and whatnot - we need to bring our system kicking and screaming into this century, because I contend that it uses last-century technology. If the Minister can have an open mind about that and, in his responsibility for public expenditure and reform, ensure that we make our system fit for purpose, that will send a signal.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	Is there a clear set of metrics?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-06-22T11:50:00+01:00	Which ones are left?
