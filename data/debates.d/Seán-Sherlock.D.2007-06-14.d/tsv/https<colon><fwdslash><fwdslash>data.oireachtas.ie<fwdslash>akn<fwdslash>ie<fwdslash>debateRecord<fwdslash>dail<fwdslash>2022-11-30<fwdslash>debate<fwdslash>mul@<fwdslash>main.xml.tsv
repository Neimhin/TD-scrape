[<p eid="para_102">I am glad to put my name to this motion, which states: "during the past 25 years of a law-enforcement approach to drug abuse, drug-related deaths have increased by 225 per cent, compared to a 68 per cent reduction in road deaths in the same period, with the total number of such deaths well exceeding 10,500." That is 10,500 lives and 10,500 families. The multiplied consequences of this are horrific to imagine. The motion also states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_103">— Ireland now has the joint-highest rate of drug-induced deaths among 16 to 64-year-olds in the European Union (EU);</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_104">— the number of people prosecuted for possession for personal use has increased over that period by 484 per cent, with more than a quarter of a million convictions recorded for that offence;</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_105">— in the same period there has been a substantial overall increase in drug use, with use of cocaine rising by [approximately] 10,376 per cent, benzodiazepines by 1,824 per cent and cannabis by 263 per cent;</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_106">— drug abuse and its harmful effects, including crimes of violence, intimidation and extortion aimed at addicts, their families and their communities, are no longer urban phenomena and are spread across the State;</p>, <p eid="para_107"> I represent the constituency of Cork East. I have first-hand experience of witnessing deals taking place within my neighbourhood. I also have first-hand experience of seeing the prevalence of recreational drug usage, especially of cocaine. Such behaviour has become normalised in our society. We cannot keep burying our heads in the sand. I would have been an advocate for stronger policing but the criminal justice response has not worked. If I look at crime statistics of the sort issued to joint policy committees such as those on Cork County Council, detections of possession of drugs for sale or supply across the city and county fell by 351 between January and August last year to 263 in the same period this year, which represented a reduction of 26%. The dogs on the street know drug use and sale and supply are increasing but the policing response, anecdotally, is moving away. The resources are not there. We now need the community health response. If one speaks to members of An Garda Síochána privately and off the record, they will say the same thing. It is beyond policing and beyond a criminal justice thought process or framework in relation to how it is being tackled.</p>, <p eid="para_108"> Having said that, the motion is very clear that we must still ensure we go after the drug cartels and the "Mr. Bigs" of this world.</p>, <p eid="para_109">We now see their influence seeping down into communities. Money procured from recreational drug use by middle class kids and kids of all persuasions - when I say "kids" I am speaking about young adults and older adults - is now going into laundering, such as through the procurement of buildings and other property throughout the State. That needs to be tackled forthwith.</p>, <p eid="para_110"> The Portuguese model offers a solution. It involves a long-term commitment but it is something we can embrace. If we embrace and establish the citizens' assembly, we will hear what the citizens have to say. We will be surprised at their response.</p>]
[<p eid="para_735">May I be permitted to make a very short point of order?</p>]
[<p eid="para_737">It is on the 80:20 funding-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_740">I do respect the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_742">But we are being told to bring forward legislation and we cannot.</p>]
[<p eid="para_807">I move amendment No. 1:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_808">In page 3, after line 29, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_809">
<b>“Report on provision and cost of community welfare officers</b>
</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_810"><b>4.</b> The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the currently prevailing levels of provision of, and accessibility to, community welfare officers and on the additional recruitment and other costs that would be entailed in ensuring that a community welfare officer was available for consultation by members of the public in all social welfare offices during ordinary hours of business.”.</p>, <p eid="para_811">I tabled this amendment because I wish to raise again the issue of community welfare officer service in the context of ensuring that people who need face-to-face meetings with community welfare officers will have that option available to them. I appreciate that last night the Minister categorically stated that such a service exists whereby if somebody wants to make an appointment, he or she can do so. We all recognise the vital service that community welfare officers provide. There is a sense, however, from my perspective as a typical constituency Deputy, that there are places throughout this State where this service existed once upon a time but where it no longer exists. In those areas, the service is moving away from the customer.</p>, <p eid="para_812"> The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is extremely important. The figures up to the end of September 2022 show that there is a range of services provided, including: support with bills; child-related payments; support with clothing; support with funerals; support with general housing needs; illness expenses; and urgent needs payments. Up to the end of September 2022, nearly €40 million was paid out.</p>, <p eid="para_813">It is a vital service of which we are all very protective, including the Minister, because it gets money to people who need it the most: those who are at a risk of poverty. It is such a flexible way in which to resource people who so badly need resources across a plethora of payments. The discretionary element of it is so vital that it must be protected.</p>, <p eid="para_814"> The basis of the amendment is to ask that the Minister would lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the current prevailing levels of provision of and accessibility to community welfare officers, CWOs, and on the additional recruitment and other costs that would be entailed in ensuring a community welfare officer is available for consultation by members of the public in all social welfare offices during ordinary hours of business.</p>, <p eid="para_815"> The Minister may tell us that people have access to Intreo offices. We can take as a given the fact that most people have transport now, but not everybody does. I have witnessed scenarios where people do not have access to either public or private transport, who rely on taxis. For them to move away from the clinic type arrangement that once existed to now having to go to their nearest town, which could be 20 km or 30 km away, to avail of an Intreo service puts the service that bit farther away from them. All I am calling for in this amendment is that we would at least have some degree of an assessment of how the service is working and recognise the importance of it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_818">I am conscious of timings.</p>]
[<p eid="para_820">I will be guided by your good self, Acting Chair. I welcome the Minister's response. I know her to be a fair-minded person. If she says she will do this report, I know she will do it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_822">I do not want to labour the point too much, except to say that I and the Labour Party would be quite protective of the scheme. When we hear of unconfirmed reports about the creation of hubs within the Department itself on decision-making procedures, dare I say that we naturally become paranoid and suspicious. Paranoia in politics is no bad thing, as long as it is in small micro doses. We all have very good relationships with individual officers right across the system. It is an excellent Department that delivers so much for citizens. The supplementary welfare allowance legislation goes back to Frank Cluskey. The Minister will appreciate where the Labour Party stands in terms of protecting the supplementary allowance scheme and the role of the community welfare officer. I welcome the Minister's response and on that basis I shall not press the amendment. I am quite happy to withdraw it on the basis of the commitment I have been given.</p>]
[<p eid="para_840">I move amendment No. 3:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_841">In page 4, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_842">
<b>“Report on impact of employee PRSI contributions on minimum wage employees</b>
</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_843"><b>5.</b> The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the impact of employee PRSI contribution rates on workers earning the national minimum wage, having regard both to the pending increase in the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to the proposed transition to a Living Wage.”.</p>, <p eid="para_844">We are back to the issue of reports but, unfortunately, we are now restricted to that in legislation of this nature. They are the only way we can have scope to push back at the Government. On Second Stage, the Minister stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_845">Weekly earnings in excess of €410 attract employer PRSI at a higher rate of 11.05%. The earnings threshold increase from €410 to €441 in section 4 is designed to take account of the forthcoming increase in the minimum wage from €10.50 to €11.30 per hour.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_846">Employers with employees benefiting from the increase in the national minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI.</p>, <p eid="para_847">The amendment seeks to provide for some sort of an assessment of how that increase is impacting on both the employer and the employee in terms of the potential perceived loss of real income as a result of the increase in PRSI contributions. I seek some clarity from the Minister on where she and the Department are in respect of how, in real terms, the increase in the minimum wage will work. We do not want to have a negative impact, in real terms, on real income whereby increasing wages will be offset by increases in PRSI. I anticipate the Minister will tell me that, in real terms, that will not be the case and there is a provision for that, but in putting forward the amendment I am seeking further clarity on whether, if there is to be an increase in the national minimum wage, it will be worthwhile for an employee to receive that increase whereby it will not be taken away in taxation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_850">I am a former Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation if that is what the Minister meant. It was not the Department of Social Protection.</p>]
[<p eid="para_852">The tapering tax relief is the nub of it. I do not propose to withdraw the amendment. I propose to press it because I think it is vital. I note the Minister's response with regard to the work that is ongoing with the CSO, Revenue and various line Departments. I want to ensure that tapering tax relief issue is essentially nailed down, however. Obviously, there is an impact for the employer as well that cannot be underestimated, particularly for small employers and small companies, entities and holdings. It is, therefore, my intention to press the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_854">I appreciate that. With all due respect to the Minister and the generosity of her offer, I think I would have access to the report anyway. It will presumably be in the public domain. However-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_856">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_858">Indeed. As a matter of record, given that we put forward the amendment on behalf of the Labour Party, we would still like to ensure the amendment is promulgated. Therefore, respectfully, that is what I intend to do. I am delighted with the Minister's offer to take receipt of the report, nonetheless. I thank her for that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_862">Yes.</p>, <p eid="para_863">Section 5 agreed to.</p>]
[<p eid="para_887">I wholeheartedly support Deputy Naughten’s proposed amendment because more of us are interacting with people who are definitively feeling the effects of long Covid. The amendment is a reasonable one in that it seeks to have a report laid before the House on particular measures, especially, as stated in the amendment, in designating long Covid as an occupational illness. We all have first-hand experience, based on our interactions with our constituents, particularly front-line workers. If something can be devised or constructed to recognise that formally within the Department of Social Protection to ensure there is a payment process in recognition of it, that would be wholeheartedly welcomed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_954">I support Deputy Kerrane's amendment. This is a time when the Government, to be fair to it, and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, are putting particular emphasis on apprenticeships. There is now a clear Government policy around resourcing apprenticeships. We want to see more apprenticeships coming from right across the demographic spectrum, particularly in instances where people have not attained points for third level institutions and they may be thinking about apprenticeships to create that environment where they are encouraged to take up apprenticeships without the loss of any element of their household income. In that context, I support the amendment.</p>]
