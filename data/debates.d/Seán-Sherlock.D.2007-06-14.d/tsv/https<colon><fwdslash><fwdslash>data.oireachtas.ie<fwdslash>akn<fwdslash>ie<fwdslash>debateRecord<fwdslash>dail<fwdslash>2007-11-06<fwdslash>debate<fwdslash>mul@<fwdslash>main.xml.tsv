SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister for her reply.  The timelines are as we anticipated and I welcome the establishment of the consultative committee.  I refer the Minister to a speech given by Commissioner Fischer Boel in Paris last month.  She referred to the Health Check, the strengthening of competitiveness, supporting rural society and so on.  It was all very aspirational in its aims.  Farmers are worried about the issues of cross-compliance and modulation under the single payment scheme and, particularly, whether the Commission will place upper or lower limits on payments to them under the scheme in the context of the Health Check.  They are worried about the nature of cross compliance and the stringent controls under which they are placed.  Has the Government defined a clear negotiating position on those issues because farmers have strong views on them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Government is now discriminating against those people who got their applications in on time and who will now be cut off as a result of this action.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank the Minister of State for his verbose answer and his advertising blurb for RTE.  I appreciate the fact that Bord Bia and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs through the Leader programme are doing much to encourage farmers' markets.  However, on the ground, many farmers' markets are striving — I will not say they are struggling — to boost their popularity locally.  Much of this work is done through voluntary effort.  While programmes are in place through Leader to help them, if some sort of direct support was made available to them for advertising through local media, it would be of great assistance to them.Judging from the Minister of State's answer, he is not telling me that his Department necessarily will be directly responsible for that and I accept this point.  I also accept the fact that there is serious potential within this country for the growth of local markets.  Will the Minister of State consider the idea of direct finance for marketing and advertising?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am aware of the time constraints.  Given that the legislation is at the stage of a first reading at the Council of Ministers, is the Minister aware of the range of pesticides that will come under the ambit of this procedure?
