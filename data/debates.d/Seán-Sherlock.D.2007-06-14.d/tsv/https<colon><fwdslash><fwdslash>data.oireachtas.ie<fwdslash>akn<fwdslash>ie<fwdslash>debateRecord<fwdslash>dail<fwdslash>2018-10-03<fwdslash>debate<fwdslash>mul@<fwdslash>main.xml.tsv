SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T15:00:00+01:00	I thank the Minister of State with responsibility for this issue for coming before the House today. I want to raise the issue of the defunding of the INFANT research centre, a perinatal healthcare centre in University College Cork. It is a research centre funded by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, led by female investigators and the only one of its kind in the State. The centre deals specifically with ensuring better health outcomes for pregnant women and their children and babies, both in utero and after birth. A decision has been made by Science Foundation Ireland to defund the centre. I will not use any other words to describe the decision. No matter what way it is parsed, it was a decision to defund this vital research centre. The INFANT centre subscribed to an external process whereby its activities were reviewed by an international panel of experts, chaired by none other than Professor Gordon Smith, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at Cambridge University. In its deliberations while examining the work and output of INFANT, the panel clearly stated that the centre should continue to be funded by SFI. Under a subsequent decision, which is now in the public domain, SFI instigated its own process. Notwithstanding the rigorous process the research centre has undergone as part of the external review, Science Foundation Ireland decided, based on a second opaque and secretive process, that the INFANT centre should be defunded. I raise this issue because there are serious question marks over the SFI process. It has not been transparent and neither I nor the taxpayers of this country have sufficient insight into the process by which this decision was made. When millions of euro of taxpayers' money are at stake, we need to hear from the Minister of State the reasons the second process was designed, who was in charge of it and whether the director general of SFI oversaw the second oversight panel. It rankles me that two eminently qualified members of the board of governors of INFANT, Dr. Ruth Barrington and Professor Douglas Kell, resigned recently. According to a statement from Dr. Ruth Barrington, a former chief executive of the Health Research Board, the SFI process was "neither objective nor fair". I hope that the Minister of State and his officials will have clear oversight of the process. I hope he will give us some hope that he will pour light on the approach taken by Science Foundation Ireland and its director general on this issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T15:10:00+01:00	Gabh mo leithscéal, is there a copy of the Minister of State's speech?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T15:10:00+01:00	No.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T15:10:00+01:00	The key line in the Minister's response is: "In the case of INFANT, the independent international oversight panel recommended that it should not receive immediate refunding." I know the Minister of State does not wish to deliberately misinform the House. I know notes were prepared for the Minister and I have been in that position. Let us be clear that there are two processes here. One is the international peer review which is the external process. That was chaired by Professor Gordon Smith, one of the most pre-eminent professors of obstetrics and gynaecology in the world, and he enthusiastically recommended refunding without further review. The Minister of State refers to an international oversight panel. That is SFI's international oversight panel, a second and separate process which is secretive and anonymous and with which none of the researchers or principal investigators involved in INFANT had any dealings. There is something opaque and lacking in transparency in this process. It is for the Minister of State to examine that process on behalf of the taxpayer because I fear that it was deliberately gamed to take out a research centre which is one of the smallest of the seven to hand. The centre was led by women researchers and dealt with women and children. The SFI tried to take out the lowest hanging fruits and thought it was on the path of least resistance. There is an issue of transparency here. Dr. Ruth Barrington and Professor Douglas Kell stood down because they questioned that SFI process. I implore the Minister to look at this. I am being genuine in the interventions I am making. It is extremely disappointing that UCC did not appeal the decision or back its own female researchers. Why is that? There are serious questions in this regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T18:30:00+01:00	Consequent on the Minister's explanation in respect of signage on amendment No. 17, I wish to withdraw my name from amendments Nos. 19 and 20.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T19:30:00+01:00	I seek clarification on the amendment. There are many bars throughout the country which sponsor soccer teams, GAA teams, all classes of sporting organisation and the quid pro quo for that sponsorship is that their particular hostelry is emblazoned on the jersey. As a consequence of this amendment, will that practice cease beyond 31 December 2023? That practice is, by implication, advertising alcohol. If that is the case many smaller clubs who rely on that essential sponsorship from small local family owned inter-generational bars could have a serious permutation in terms of trying to fill the gap on foot of the lack of that sponsorship that would have been readily available. I seek clarification on that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T19:30:00+01:00	Therefore, it will cease.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T19:30:00+01:00	In essence, if a local bar in a local town or village wants to sponsor the local GAA team beyond 2023, the permutation of this amendment is such that they will not be able to do that anymore.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T19:30:00+01:00	I thank the Deputy.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T21:40:00+01:00	I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which did a fine job in assisting us with interpreting the Bill. Broadly speaking, the Bill is non-contentious and is aimed at two distinct issues. With regard to the sentencing of repeat sexual offenders, these provisions originated in a Private Members’ Bill, sponsored by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, and subsequently adopted by the Government. Essentially, the Bill proposes a new section 58 for the Criminal Justice (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, to be headed commission of another offence specified in Schedule within a specified period. This proposed new section mirrors section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, which provides for a regime of enhanced custodial sentences for offenders who reoffend. The basic idea is that where an adult is convicted on indictment of one of the serious offences scheduled to the Act and is sentenced to at least five years and where he or she is subsequently convicted of another scheduled offence within seven years of the first conviction, the court must sentence the defendant to a minimum of three-quarters of the maximum permissible sentence for that subsequent offence. However, there is an important proviso. If the court is satisfied that it would be disproportionate in the circumstances to impose such a sentence, the court may deviate from it. This mirrors section 25 of the 2007 Act. Tom O’Malley describes this as “a significant safety valve”, in what would otherwise be “quite a swingeing provision that could result in remarkably harsh sentences for certain offences which, while inherently serious for the most part, might not always merit the minimum sentences apparently required by the section.” The Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper states that no regulatory impact assessment was published alongside the Bill. The service is not aware of any assessment which may have been conducted by the Department regarding potential costs, implications or expected impact of the Bill. It again quotes Tom O’Malley on the 2007 precedent:How much impact s[ection] 25 has had on sentencing practice is impossible to identify. Arguably, a court sentencing a person to whom it applies should always begin by identifying the minimum term to be specified and then decide if that term would be disproportionate in all the circumstances. One suspects, however, that s[ection] 25 seldom impinges on day-to-day practice, save to the extent that courts will have regard to relevant previous convictions as a matter of course.If the Minister of State has an insight on this, it would be useful to hear it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-10-03T21:50:00+01:00	I beg the indulgence of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and that of the Minister of State, who was in mid-flight when Deputy Ó Laoghaire came into the House. I ask the Minister of State to take cognisance of the Library Research Service paper on this Bill. I made reference to the other issues with the current law on incest. There are a number of points addressed there which I will not go into now. It would be useful at the next Stage of the Bill if the Minister could have regard to those points.
