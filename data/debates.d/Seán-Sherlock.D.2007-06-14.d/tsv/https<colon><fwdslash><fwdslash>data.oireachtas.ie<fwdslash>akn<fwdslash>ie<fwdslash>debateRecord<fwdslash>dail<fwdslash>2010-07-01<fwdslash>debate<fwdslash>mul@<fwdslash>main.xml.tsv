SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Is the Minister of State aware of the situation with the Midleton train at present?  If he wants to speak authoritatively, he should check his facts.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The guidelines that are published are only guidelines.  When Deputy Batt O'Keeffe was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he published guidelines on the relaxation of rules for one-off houses in rural areas.  The guidelines that were issued stated councillors must have regard to development plans as they existed in local authority areas.However, the local development plan itself had very stringent rules and regulations on green belt areas, and certain types of designations for particular areas which superseded the guidelines themselves.  It did not make any change whatsoever to the number of one-off houses built as a result of the publication of those guidelines.Similarly, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, published guidelines last week — or gave notice of his intention to publish guidelines — on houses on national secondary routes.  I am aware of three cases of people who have a genuine housing need who wish to build on family owned land on a national secondary route.  I have regard to the guidelines published by the Minister but I am told by the local authority that the development plan, which was adopted by the members elected by the people will supersede those guidelines.  There is a precedent whereby a local authority granted planning on a national secondary route and it was appealed by the NRA to An Bord Pleanála in any case.The issuance of guidelines is a bit of a sham to be honest.  Sometimes, they are deliberately put out there by Ministers to give voice to the idea that they are somehow dealing with an issue.  In reality, I have never seen them have an effect in how they are transposed.  The local development plan as passed under a reserve function always seems to take precedent.In essence, the point I am trying to make is that if we further diminish the power of local public representatives to intervene in planning cases or in the planning laws, too much power will be ceded to the Minister who may not have regard to local factors and the grey area that exists which might push a case one way or the other.  If too much power is prescribed in a centralised way it will have a negative impact on the ability of a local authority to function as it relates to planning, and good planning at that.I fail to understand the Green Party's position on this.  I state respectfully and without any malice that what Deputy Gogarty is saying in effect is that the gentlemen and ladies on local authorities have received their democratic mandates from the people but the Green Party does not trust them to exercise that mandate as it relates to the planning process and therefore it will instigate a set of rules and regulations that will supersede their powers.  By implication, what is stated is that the people are wrong.  The people put in the councillors and therefore there is an implication in the legislation that the councillors made mistakes and the Green Party will come along and rectify those mistakes in a condescending and patronising fashion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is no way to legislate.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is not the way to legislate.  It absolutely and utterly patronises the people on this side of the House who try to give voice to those trying to build houses who have genuine housing needs and who want to retain the right to live in their local communities.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	They will not be here for too much longer and thank God for it.  Then we can get to a situation where the House will start legislating on the basis of common sense and not on the basis of——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——the nanny state, where a small rump in the Parliament can control how the vast majority of the people can think.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We need to move away from that line of legislation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am tired of the Member to my right coming to the House and day in day out using language that debases this House.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	He may disagree with my point of view and I may disagree with the Deputy's point of view and we will spar but it is never personal.  However, with privilege I stand before the people here as a Member for Cork East and I will not allow other Members to debase the House's legislative programme by imposing legislation that is undemocratic and will have serious permutations for how local authorities will be able to operate because it gives too much power to the Minister.  I say that without use of bad language, without debasing the House and without bringing the debate down into the morass to which others would like to bring it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I wish to raise an issue which I feel will have a deep impact on the ability of hospitals like Mallow General Hospital to deliver acute services.For the past five years we have been through a number of processes in relation to Mallow General Hospital, including the Horwath, Wrixon and Teamwork reviews.  Now, through a new national reconfiguration process, the HSE will seek, in an underhand and surreptitious way, to undermine the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services.I have before me a document in respect of this matter.  The people who represent the interests of the hospital and who live within its catchment area are undergoing a reconfiguration process, headed up by Professor John Higgins.  There is general agreement that change is needed within the hospital and that there will be implications for the delivery of acute services, but that the capacity of the hospital should not be undermined in any way.  In other words, if there is to be a loss or diminution of acute surgical services, they would be buttressed by acute medical services.We have bought into that process and have been given assurances in relation to it.  We now discover documentation emanating from the HSE showing that it seeks to assign to every hospital in the country a new modelling system ranging from 1 to 4, depending on the category of hospital, and which will put Mallow into the No. 2 category.  The document states that this hospital will not have an ICU so the patients and doctors need to be made aware that the resources are not in place to provide the full spectrum of an acute hospital resuscitation, that is, intubation, ventilation and resuscitation, IVR.  The patient must give informed consent and have knowledge of this prior to admission.  A ceiling of care discussion needs to take place and be documented with appropriate patients prior to admission to this facility.  The document goes on to say that standards of care should be measured and comparable to those delivered at a model 3 and model 4 hospital.  A model 3 or 4 hospital would be the equivalent of Cork University Hospital, which is a tertiary centre and the nearest geographically to Mallow.I demand a meeting with Mr. Pat Healy, regional director of operations for the HSE south region.  I demand respectfully, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member, a meeting with Ms Laverne McGuinness and Mr. Brian Gilroy, who are in charge of efficiencies, and I demand that the Joint Committee on Health and Children discuss this document because it will have serious implications for the delivery of acute care.  By a surreptitious and secretive method, the HSE will seek to diminish the ability of Mallow to deliver acute care.  If a ceiling of care discussion has to take place on every admission, most people will not be admitted to the hospital and will have to go to CUH, thereby reducing the ability of Mallow General Hospital to deliver services.There are many scenarios where resuscitation might be appropriate for an individual on whom a "do not resuscitate" order has been placed, for example, anaphylactic reaction to an infusion.  Such a notion has major consequences for the status and reputation of a hospital and for the esteem of those working there.  Discussion about ceilings of care as espoused in this process is, in most clinical situations, unnecessary and often inappropriate and counter-productive.  I wonder if dividing patients into categories of access with regard to resuscitation is unconstitutional, in that it would negate the rights of a patient.Numbers in the hospital would be so reduced that it would not be viable.  That is what is at play here.  This is an attempt by the HSE at national level to undermine the local reconfiguration process which all of the stakeholders have bought into.  We recognise that change is needed but it seems the HSE is trying push through a plan whereby hospitals like Mallow will no longer be able to provide acute care, whether medical or surgical, and the 4,500 people who are served in an acute setting in Mallow will have make their way through CUH, which does not have the capacity to deliver those services because the capital investment has not been made there.We need transparency.  I am asking, as is my right as an Oireachtas Member representing the people of Cork East, for a meeting with the HSE at national level so that I can learn what plans are afoot and what surreptitious methods are being employed in the downgrading of hospitals like Mallow.
