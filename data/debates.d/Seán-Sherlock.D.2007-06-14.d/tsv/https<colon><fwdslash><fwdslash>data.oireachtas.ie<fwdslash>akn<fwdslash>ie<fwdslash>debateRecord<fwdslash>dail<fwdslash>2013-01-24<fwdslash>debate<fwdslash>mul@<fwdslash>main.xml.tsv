[<p eid="para_705">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. From the preventative point of view, I wholeheartedly agree with his sentiments regarding the importance of raising awareness. If we can take preventative measures and utilise early intervention measures to tackle childhood obesity, it will have a positive effect downstream for the citizens themselves as well as for the Exchequer in terms of medical interventions and so forth.</p>, <p eid="para_706"> The Department is committed to promoting healthy lifestyle choices among children and young people. This is reflected in the curriculum for primary and post-primary schools. The successful active school flag, ASF, programme also provides evidence to the effect that schools are keenly interested in ensuring that their students have positive attitudes to physical activities. However and as the Deputy articulated, there is only so much that schools can do. There is an onus on parents and the community to ensure that children are as active as possible outside of school.</p>, <p eid="para_707"> The Department recognises the importance of cultivating healthy attitudes in children. This is reflected in the primary school curriculum for science, physical education and social, personal and health education, SPHE. Pupils are enabled to develop an understanding of food and nutrition, including the importance of food for energy and growth and the importance of a balanced and healthy diet along with being physically active.</p>, <p eid="para_708"> In post-primary schools, the SPHE syllabus contains modules on healthy eating, and physical education promotes activity. The popular optional subject, home economics, also has a role to play. On 4 October 2012, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, published a framework for the junior cycle. One of the principles of the framework is well-being. This principle will be underpinned by key statements of learning that require students to understand the importance of food and diet in making healthy lifestyle choices, to be confident and competent participants in physical activity, to be motivated to be physically active and to take action to safeguard and promote their well-being and that of others. A new short course in SPHE is being designed for 100 hours, some 30 hours longer than the current programme.</p>, <p eid="para_709"> The Department seeks to recognise schools that strive to achieve a physically educated and active school community by awarding them the ASF. More than 1,000 primary and post-primary schools have registered for an ASF. To date, 156 flags have been awarded with the number expected to rise significantly during the coming year. Through the ASF process, schools have developed many innovative and exciting ways of encouraging their school communities to become more active.</p>, <p eid="para_710"> In cultivating healthy eating attitudes in children, the 2009 life skills survey of primary and post-primary schools showed that 87% of the primary schools and 32% of the post-primary schools that took part in the survey operated a healthy eating policy. The life skills survey was repeated in 2012. It is hoped that the percentage of schools, particularly at post-primary level, with a healthy eating policy will have improved. The results will be published later this year.</p>, <p eid="para_711"> The Department of Health and my Department collaborate and co-operate on a number of relevant areas, including healthy eating. The Department of Health has involved this Department and others in developing Healthy Ireland, a report that is to be published shortly. My Department is also a member of the Department of Health's special group on obesity, which is meeting today.</p>]
[<p eid="para_716">I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has stated. He is spot on in trying to raise levels of consciousness around this issue. The Department of Education and Skills is part of the Department of Health's special group on obesity.</p>, <p eid="para_717"> Deputy O'Donovan illustrated an example of a child with digestives.</p>, <p eid="para_718">The child did not pack the lunch box and neither did the teacher. It was the parent. Schools act <i>in loco parentis</i> and by their very nature will do so much. I refer, for example, to the activity around the active school flag for which 1,000 primary and post-primary schools have registered. A total of 156 flags have been awarded which shows that there is a rising consciousness on the issue. If the green flag initiative is anything to go by then I have no doubt that this will be just as successful in terms of raising awareness. However, there is a role for parents as well, and for community and teacher involvement.</p>, <p eid="para_719"> Technology is one way of raising that kind of awareness. Deputy O’Donovan referred to the post-Christmas rush to purchase new gear and to get exercise. We all have post-Christmas guilt. I downloaded two applications, apps, one called "Run Keeper" and the other "Map my Fitness". Such apps will help to modify people’s behaviour.</p>, <p eid="para_720"> I accept the Deputy’s point but I firmly believe there is a stronger role for parents, and we speak a little to common sense. I am happy to talk to the Deputy again on the matter to see whether we can progress the issue in the wider context of reducing the level of obesity. There must be a role for the Parliament through the committee system or intra-parliamentary group to examine the issue. That could be one way of seeking to tackle the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_760">Job creation is a key priority for the Government. Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2016 and making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. The 2013 action plan for jobs will set out detailed targets for important measures of economic transition and for the delivery of policy actions to support employment, enterprise, innovation and exports. It will include indicators such as job creation in agency supported enterprises, the number of high potential start-ups to be supported in 2013, the target for new foreign direct investment projects and the number of significant investments by Enterprise Ireland-assisted firms in a range of areas, which are critical to company growth and job creation.</p>, <p eid="para_761"> Considerable resources are being committed to the task. Our Department's Exchequer capital allocation for 2013, including carryover of unspent moneys from 2012, amounts to €483 million gross. At a time of severe restraint in capital resources, this demonstrates the Government's commitment to enterprise development and jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_762"> We have also developed innovative instruments to leverage up the impact of this capital expenditure to support job creation through our Department and its agencies. These include the provision of €175 million in Exchequer funding through the seed and venture capital scheme. This funding has a target to leverage €525 million in line with past experience. An additional Exchequer allocation of €25 million is being provided under the development capital scheme in 2013, targeted at mid-sized indigenous firms. The Government committed €50 million to the scheme in 2012 and this funding will leverage up to €225 million. The Department will also continue to roll out and monitor the €90 million microfinance fund and the €450 million credit guarantee scheme, which again leverage smaller Exchequer outlays.</p>, <p eid="para_763">
<i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
</p>, <p eid="para_764"> In a similar vein, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF has developed a range of support funds for the SME sector to provide equity, credit and recovery investment. The NPRF will invest between €350 million and €500 million with a view to creating a total funding pool of at least €850 million for investment in SMEs. In addition, a new package of tax measures to support SMEs was outlined by the Minister for Finance in budget 2013. It is important, however, to recognise that the economic transition is not solely about the volume of Exchequer resources aimed at the enterprise sector. Equally important in the 2013 action plan for jobs will be the reforms which we are continuing to implement on an ongoing basis to enhance our competitiveness, improve the environment for business, support enterprises, and progress sectoral strategies. The 2013 plan will be published in the coming weeks, following approval by Government.</p>]
[<p eid="para_770">As the Minister has said, the Government must create a set of conditions that facilitate growth in employment rates. I am not aware of any Government having set an employment rate target. I am not aware of a precedent for that.</p>, <p eid="para_771"> The Deputy referred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF. It will be used to support the SME sector and provide equity, credit and recovery investment. The NPRF will provide up to €850 million on a commercial basis with a view to leveraging private sector funding into the Irish investment market. The Government is creating conditions such as a 25% increase in the threshold for VAT cash receipts basis accounting to improve cash flow for SMEs. It is doubling the amount of expenditure that qualifies for the research and development tax credit for SMEs so that we can support more innovation by businesses. That will have a positive impact on foreign direct investment. It is extending the foreign earnings deduction scheme to support exporting companies to develop a presence in new key markets.</p>, <p eid="para_772"> The economic transition is not solely about the volume of Exchequer resources aimed at the enterprise sector. We must give equal importance to the reforms that will result from instigating a range of measures to enhance our competitiveness, improve the environment for business and create the jobs that are so necessary.</p>, <p eid="para_773"> There are IDA and Enterprise Ireland targets. Because of the constraints of time here in the House I would be happy to talk to the Deputy about those targets. He is welcome to come to the Department for a briefing any time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_777">Deputy Tóibín says we are not allocating sufficient resources. The seed and venture capital scheme has €175 million of Exchequer funding. The NPRF will spend approximately €850 million, which will be available for investment in the Irish SME sector. The IDA has an allocation of €86 million for 2013. Its targets are set out in its Horizon 2020 programme. We have allocated €120 million to Enterprise Ireland. It has clear targets to support high potential start-ups. There are innovation programmes, new technology centres and spending on technology transfer within our universities. There is €69.5 million for enterprise supports. There are Graduates for International Growth, additional Lean programmes and engagement with 300 first time exporting companies. Local enterprise offices have been established at local level.</p>, <p eid="para_778"> If Deputy Tóibín wishes to critique the Government's allocation of resources on each of those specific processes I would like to give more time to hammer it out with him and see where Sinn Féin thinks we should allocate more resources and taxpayers' money in creating jobs.</p>]
[<p eid="para_881">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 13 together. </p>, <p eid="para_882"> The rise in youth unemployment as a result of the global economic downturn is a challenge for most EU countries. The average EU unemployment rate for those under 25 years of age in the labour force is 23.7%. In Ireland, the youth unemployment rate is 30%, while the long-term unemployment rate is 8.9%. </p>, <p eid="para_883"> The aim of the Action Plan for Jobs is to create a supportive environment for enterprise to create and sustain jobs. All of the measures in the action plan are designed to promote employment opportunities in different ways and many young people and long term unemployed people will benefit from the implementation of these measures. Many of the sectors we have focused on supporting under the action plan, such as digital gaming, ICT and tourism, offer opportunities particularly suited to younger workers. Labour market activation programmes administered by other Departments, such as JobBridge, Springboard and Tús also aim to increase youth employment.</p>, <p eid="para_884"> The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has worked with business representative bodies to highlight the range of supports available to companies who recruit people from the Live Register. These include Revenue’s job assist scheme and the employer’s PRSI exemption scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection. The Department of Social Protection also operates the back to work enterprise allowance for long-term unemployed people wishing to set up their own business. Measures to support micro-finance and mentoring are particularly important to people who have been out of the labour market for some time or to young entrepreneurs who do not yet have a track record. </p>, <p eid="para_885"> As part of a suite of measures aimed at improving access to credit for SMEs and entrepreneurs under the Action Plan for Jobs, we have established the Microfinance Fund targeted at entrepreneurs, start-ups and existing microenterprises employing not more than ten people. The County and City Enterprise Boards provide a range of services, including training and mentoring, to people wishing to set up their own business, including those on the live register. Enterprise Ireland also has a range of funding supports available for entrepreneurial activity. For example, the agency launched New Frontiers, Ireland’s largest entrepreneur development programme in February 2012. It supported 60 companies through the Competitive Start Fund last year and also introduced a new Competitive Start Fund for female entrepreneurs.</p>, <p eid="para_886"> Through the new Momentum initiative, the €20 million labour market education and training fund operated by the Department of Education and Skills will assist 6,500 long term unemployed jobseekers to gain skills and to access work in sectors of the economy where there are job opportunities. This initiative includes specific provision for those under 25 years of age. The Government as a whole will continue to do all it can to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs or to get their first job. In addition to the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government’s Pathways to Work strategy is focused on assisting the long-term unemployed to move into employment through more regular engagement, upskilling and training. </p>, <p eid="para_887"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is currently preparing the 2013 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government and in that context, we will be exploring further measures which can be taken to transform our economy and support job creation to support these groups of unemployed people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_891">I acknowledge everything that the Deputy said. There is no getting away from the fact that the rate of youth unemployment is extremely high, including across all of Europe. A strong attempt is being made during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council to give effect to the youth guarantee and to ensure that we create the climate across Europe, in a way that will benefit Ireland, to ensure a return of people to work.</p>, <p eid="para_892"> The Momentum scheme was launched before Christmas last under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills. There will be specific projects available under that programme to assist those aged under 25 years in a return to employment through training to work opportunities and a graduate activation programme.</p>]
[<p eid="para_894">Am I out of time?</p>]
[<p eid="para_897">Again, I acknowledge the points made. The Deputy must also acknowledge the deep structural changes that gave rise to this unemployment crisis which, as stated by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in a reply to an earlier question, was our dependence on construction, in which sector many of the skills were employed. A sudden downturn which results in one having to make a correction of the order of €38 plus billion over a five or six year period requires one to find new ways to create labour market activation measures. We believe we are succeeding. For instance, many jobs have been created through the JobBridge scheme.</p>, <p eid="para_898"> I heartily acknowledge that there is a crisis in the area of youth unemployment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_901">To repeat the point, we all agree the problem of emigration is scaring the social fabric. However, I do not agree with the rhetoric that it is all negative.</p>]
[<p eid="para_903">A hell of a lot of initiatives are taking place in our third level institutions, and out there is a boundless creativity which does not work its way into the discourse in a House such as this. One has only to go to these institutions and meet these people. I take issue with the point made by Deputy Tóibín on this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_905">I repeat the point that if all one's eggs are put into the construction basket and a downturn in the sector occurs, it will give rise to emigration to new areas where there are opportunities such as western Australia, Canada and North America. This is exactly what we are seeing happen. From a sectoral point of view we are seeing this trend. We want to reverse this by creating the programmes we have to allow people with this skillset to retrain and move into other sectors. We are doing this and by degrees we are slowly succeeding in this vein.</p>, <p eid="para_906">
