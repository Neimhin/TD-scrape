SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2013-01-16T20:20:00+00:00	I welcome the opportunity address the House on this important issue. I am a graduate of the College of Commerce in Cork so I have first-hand knowledge of the important experience people gain within the post-leaving certificate sector. From personal experience I am aware that at a particular stage in one's life one may not be entirely sure of the direction one wants to take. The PLC sector fills an important gap and allows people to take some time and pursue courses while they decide on the ultimate direction they wish to take, both academically and in their working lives. I have always been grateful for the experience I gained from my time at the College of Commerce in Cork, particularly as it afforded me the opportunity to take the time to make the decision to pursue my education further by proceeding to the university sector. I place these facts on the record of the House because it is important to convey to people the fact that there is an understanding of the importance of the PLC sector. We do not want to pay lip service to that sector, particularly as we are conscious of its progressive nature in the context of affording people the space to decide to proceed to achieve even further educational or vocational attainment. Ultimately, it can also facilitate them in the context of career attainment. I wish to focus on the position in respect of Cork. I do not wish to be overly parochial but I do want to discuss the impact this cut will have in County Cork. I am only too well aware of the level of focus there has been on the level of reduction in the two Cork VECs. At present, there are just under 5,400 PLC places available at City of Cork VEC and Cork County VEC. This represents a significant tranche of the overall number of such places throughout the country. There are 316 staff at the two VECs. The VECs are expected to have the same number of places available and 284 staff from next September. This is, by some margin, one of the biggest allocations of PLC places and staff in the country. It is only right that a county as important as Cork should have such a high level of resources available to it. The Department sanctions the teaching posts to the VECs which, in turn, allocate them to the schools and colleges under their remit.As the changes will not take effect until September, the VECs have the opportunity to plan how best to deal with a slightly reduced allocation. I know there has been concern that the most innovative courses, particularly in cloud computing, veterinary nursing and computer programming, are at risk. We acknowledge this. However, that is the challenge every principal of a college of further education will have to manage carefully with his or her CEO. With the Government and colleagues in Cork, I will work closely with the CEOs and local principals to ensure the breadth of course provision is maintained, particularly in the cutting edge areas that are so vital to our economic recovery. This should include examining whether similar courses offered in more than one college can be merged to ensure niche offerings are maintained. Teacher allocations should not be fixed in isolation in each college. A joined-up approach to course delivery and necessary redeployment within each VEC area is absolutely vital. I welcome and acknowledge the fact that within one week of the budget announcement last month the Minister met personally all of the CEOs and chairpersons of the VECs. He asked them to ensure the changes that had to be made would have the minimum of risk for front-line services in so far as was possible. I support that approach fully. This reflects the Minister's awareness of the good work of the PLC sector in the education system. We now have a nine-month window of opportunity to ensure the changes required are made carefully and with appropriate consideration. My priority remains to ensure all those using further education services in Cork and other areas can access the courses that will help them to up-skill and eventually find employment. Deputies on both sides of the House constantly say we have to look to other parts of the education system if further adjustments are needed. We share that sentiment and that is precisely what the Government has done in this instance. One of the measures announced in the budget will see the teaching allocation in PLC colleges increased by two points from 17 to 19. This will have the effect of bringing the pupil-teacher ratio in post-leaving certificate colleges which teach motivated adults into line with that in second level schools. This will provide for equity. We acknowledge, however, that it will result in the loss of 200 full-time teaching posts across the sector. However, we must support a strategy of prioritisation at a time of reduced resources. Having a more preferential pupil-teacher ratio in PLC colleges than in second level schools is not sustainable. I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue. It is entirely appropriate that we highlight the importance of the further education and training sector, both as part of the education system which promotes the concept of lifelong learning and as part of the country's future in terms of re-skilling and upskilling of citizens, particularly for those who are unemployed. While it would be preferable not to have to make any reduction, the Government has sought to protect front-line education services to the greatest extent possible through the protection of class sizes in free primary and second level schools and the protection of the overall numbers of special needs assistants, resource teachers and the staffing allocations to disadvantaged DEIS schools. Because of rising demographics and the protection provided in the budget for current teacher allocations, this will mean that we expect to hire an additional 450 primary teachers and 450 second level teachers for the next school year. It is worth reiterating the point about rising demographics and the economic pressures on the Department's budget. We must ensure sufficient numbers of primary and second level teachers to plan for the rise in the population. Despite the economic climate, the Government has shown its strong commitment to protecting and investing in education and creating employment for teachers.  It is also worth reflecting on the record of the party opposite during its last term of office in education-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-01-16T20:30:00+00:00	I have never been in government before.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-01-16T20:30:00+00:00	Almost 4,450 posts in primary and post-primary schools have been taken out of the education system since 2008. The vast majority of the work done was carried out under budgets constructed by some of the Members opposite. In that time there was an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools from 27 to 28. There was an increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools from 18 to 19. There was also the removal of eligibility for student support grants from those in receipt of the back to education allowance, the allowance that helps many in the PLC sector. VTOS allowances were removed for those pursuing post-leaving certificate courses in 2010.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2013-01-16T20:30:00+00:00	The party opposite changed the favourable pupil-teacher ratio of 17:1 to 19:1 for the leaving certificate vocational programme in 2011 in order to secure a reduction of approximately 200 posts which was justified at the time by saying it would bring it into line with the normal pupil-teacher ratio in second level schools. I refer to the withdrawal of resource teachers for Traveller children at primary and post-primary level in order to secure a reduction of approximately 600 posts in 2011. I refer to the announcement of the elimination of 500 language support teachers from primary and second level schools in 2011, not to mention the elimination of the posts of primary rural co-ordinator and visiting teacher for Travellers. We are starting from a base where the country is borrowing â‚¬300 million a week. Nobody wants to preside over a situation where teachers lose their jobs. We are trying within the education budget to ensure the courses delivered for those who want to retrain and upskill will be provided within the VEC structures. We seek to do this to the best of our ability. It is necessary, therefore, to effect the savings required. I am the beneficiary of accreditation. I have a diploma in business studies which I acquired through the College of Commerce in Cork. I have first-hand experience of PLC courses which assisted me in the not too distant past and assists others in a way that allows for progression to take place.  Notwithstanding the loss of these teaching jobs, if CEOs work with us and a lateral approach is taken, we are confident that the new and highly innovative courses which allow people to progress to universities and institutes of technology can be preserved in a way that will allow for progression through the system. It is vital to ensure pupils will have that opportunity to come into the PLC system in a manner that it will cater for their needs as they progress through their careers.
