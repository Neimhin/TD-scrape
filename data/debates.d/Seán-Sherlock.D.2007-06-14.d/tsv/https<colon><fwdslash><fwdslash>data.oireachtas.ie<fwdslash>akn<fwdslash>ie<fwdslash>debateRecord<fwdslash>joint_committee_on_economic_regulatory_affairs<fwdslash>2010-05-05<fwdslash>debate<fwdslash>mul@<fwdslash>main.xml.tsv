[<p eid="para_79">I welcome the delegation.  It is the first time we have talked to individual businesses and seen first hand the effect on them.  I welcome that because it is the only way we, as politicians, can fully understand how this is having an effect on people.  If the SFA is actively participating in the high level group on business regulation, the question which arises is why no progress is being made on the issues which are before us today.  Does there need to be more of a political imperative to push the process on to try to get results sooner than we are seeing?  I am beginning to question that process because if the SFA is before us today one could surmise that we are not seeing the progress we should be seeing on that issue.</p>, <p eid="para_80">I am fascinated by Mr. Cummins's submission.  If the cost of a permit is €500 and it costs €40,000 for a consultant to put in a submission, which is based on 30 pieces of legislation and any number of statutory instruments, I do not understand why, if there is a process through the high level group, the issue has not been tackled before now.  It is something which this committee has to take up with the Minister after this meeting, in order that an action arises from it and the delegation is not just coming in here, pleading its case and walking off, with nothing else being done.  Perhaps the officials who are involved with that high level group should be brought before the committee in order that we can see what progress is being made on those issues, if that is possible.</p>, <p eid="para_81">I wanted to get a sense of where the high level group is currently at, from the delegation's perspective.  I would like an honest appraisal on where it sees that going and whether it is yielding results.</p>]
[<p eid="para_85">The SFA stated in its submission that it is examining the employment laws to which Ms McNally referred, corporate governance and health and safety.  The Health and Safety Authority came before the committee.  There are issues, in terms of the cost of running it and the expenses it has incurred which are, to my mind, questionable.  I wish to refer to the issue of waste and waste management, and regulation from that point of view.  Has the higher level group discussed the issues which we are discussing today?  Is it still stuck on other pillars?</p>]
[<p eid="para_87">Fair enough.  I wish to return to the issue of waste management.  If there is a standard model and one is operating in Cork, Waterford, Limerick or wherever, one applies for one licence which is then eligible across the 26 counties.  It seems to speak to common sense.  However, I have a sense that the local authorities are gradually, of their own accord, moving out of waste management and are transferring it to private operators.  It may be a philosophical issue.  What needs to be done now for a business which is in the waste management sector?  What is the ideal thing which needs to happen?  Do we get rid of the statutory instruments?  Do we amend the legislation?  We could introduce a new statutory instrument which gives the Minister the power to override the local authority and state, by ministerial decree, that there is one licence for the whole country, which may be the ideal scenario.</p>]
[<p eid="para_92">We are getting down to brass tacks.  This is the nub of the issue.  I am on my first mandate.  It predates my membership of this House.  If I understand Mr. Cummins's point correctly, it is that when regulations, legislation and statutory instruments are being drafted, there is no consultation with affected stakeholders.  We are not talking about reinventing the wheel but about matters referred to in other reports.  The net effect is that we need to allow for a legislative process that——</p>]
[<p eid="para_94">The Chairman may disagree with me that there is a disparity in that case.  When the State itself decides not to comply with legislation from the Union, as it often does, it often blames Brussels, yet we are very compliant when applying legislation to businesses.</p>]
[<p eid="para_104">Does Dr. O'Boyle have faith in the high-level group?</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I do not have any further questions.</p>]
