SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	There are no proposals to introduce a Government guaranteed export credit insurance scheme for Irish exporters to these countries.  The Government's position on this issue has been informed by the findings of the 2009 report commissioned by my Department from KPMG consultants.  That report established that the introduction of such a scheme would be expensive, with significant ongoing costs arising for the State.  Annual costs in respect of quite a low level of intervention in the export credit market would be about â‚¬1.7 million, and this cost would rise significantly if higher risk profile exports were covered.  In addition, it was found that such a scheme would be of very limited impact and that a negligible number of jobs could be connected with such an initiative.Under EU state aid rules, any such state scheme is not normally permissible for short-term credit insurance.  Most Irish exports fall into this category.  A temporary derogation was established in 2009 due to the financial crisis at that time.  That is now under review and is very unlikely to be maintained.  Even under this current exemption, the specific provisions of any scheme must be approved by the European Commission.  Approval would include a condition that the level of insurance premia to be paid by companies should be higher than rates provided in the open market.  This is a considerable deterrent to business, and some of the schemes introduced by other member states had poor uptake for this reason.In the intervening two years, there has been an improvement in the market for short-term export credit insurance.  Insurers have recovered their capacity for risk and the market has recovered significantly, with both new entrants to the market and new products being offered.  This has greatly improved the availability of export credit insurance on the commercial market.The publication of the detailed KPMG report is not possible.  The forensic analysis on the operation of the market for this type of insurance was only possible through the provision of sensitive, confidential data and detailed company specific information to KPMG.  This information was provided to KPMG on the condition of strict confidentiality.  Given the commercial sensitivity of this material and the limited number of companies in the market, both KPMG and the Department signed legally binding agreements with the insurers that the information provided would not be released.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
While the background research and analytical elements of the KPMG report cannot therefore be released, the key overall findings were publicised at the time and supported the view that a State supported scheme of short-term export credit insurance should not be introduced.  This remains the position but will be kept under ongoing review, including in light of advice and evidence from the appropriate agencies and business representative groups.  As the Government has a responsibility to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, a commitment of large-scale funding to an initiative with marginal benefits for Irish industry and high level risks to the State would be unwise.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  The strict confidentiality clause, which was one of the conditions that applied when people gave information during the compilation of that report, should be respected.  We can provide the Deputy with the information that is available from Enterprise Ireland about export figures and the opportunities that are arising in the BRIC countries.  The Deputy also asked about investment in jobs and the opportunities that will arise after February.  A great deal of work is ongoing at Government level to compile the new action plan for jobs.  More lateral themes are being explored as we do that.  I hope the Deputy will take in good faith my assurance that we are trying to explore and mine as many opportunities as we can.  I say that in response to the point she made about job creation.  If I understood the point the Deputy was making correctly, she said we should avail of the intellectual capacity of people who will find themselves in a new situation after February of this year.  The State needs to provide opportunities to such people, or engage with them at least.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I take the Deputy's point.  The private investment decisions of an individual are matters for the individual in question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I take the point that was made about finding a vehicle for a lump-sum investment.  I respectfully suggest the Deputy should engage with the Minister for Finance with a view to exploring possibilities in that area.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	My Department, through the work of the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Boards offers a range of supports to assist and enable Irish entrepreneurs and enterprises to engage in the optimal exploitation of innovation, research and development and to apply for patents.  The Patents Office provides information supports to applicants through the Office's website www.patentsoffice.ie   regarding patenting procedures in Ireland and abroad. The Patents Office also provides an Intellectual Property (IP) clinic service providing members of the public, inventors, entrepreneurs and business people an opportunity to discuss on a one to one basis with Patents Office staff their ideas and matters concerning IP.Since April 2010, the Patents Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Enterprise Europe Network and County Enterprise Boards have partnered to present a series of one day free seminars at a range of regional locations under the working title of "Building a Business on your Ideas".  Support nationally and locally for micro enterprises, small businesses and new start ups is provided through the wide range of assistance offered by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland.   Both the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland tailored programmes and supports in the form of grants, business advice, training and mentoring elements of which are directed at ensuring that innovative technologies and intellectual property are secured and protected.EI has strengthened the resources dedicated to the promotion and use of intellectual property and have recently appointed (January 2012)  an Intellectual Property Manager,  whose role is to act as the central point in EI for enquiries and advice on IP matters as a strategic tool in business development.  In addition, EI's Technology Transfer Strengthening Programme drives the national effort in transferring IP from the research base in the HEIs and Research Institutes in Ireland into industry, while the Technology Partnering Programme aims at partnering Irish client companies with multi-national corporations with a view to facilitating access to and promotion of significant technologies via licensing of IP and technology spin-outs.  EI also provides funding support for innovative High Potential Start-Ups under which assistance is provided towards the patent costs of the company to protect its in-house intellectual property.  Under the EI R&D Fund patent costs are an eligible expenditure item which can be included in the support offered.While it is first and foremost a matter for owners of IP to decide on the best way to protect IP rights, those owners can be confident that the Government is committed to ensuring Irish IP legislation reflects best practice in IP protection systems in Europe and elsewhere.  Indeed, the Government has been making a sustained effort over recent years to ensure that patent, trademark, industrial design and copyright laws, among other IP areas, are kept as up to date as possible. This work arises primarily in the context of EU and other international obligations.In the area of patents, my Department continues to make it easier for enterprises to patent their innovations. The Patents Amendment Bill 2011, currently in the Seanad, will enable Ireland to implement the London Agreement with the effect of lowering the current high level of translation costs for patent applicants. At EU level, Ireland is actively participating in the enhanced cooperation process for a unitary patent that will further reduce costs for Irish innovators wishing to obtain patent protection across Europe.
