[<p eid="para_91">I thank the assistant commissioner and his colleagues for attending today. How many gardaí work in the Garda national protective services bureau?</p>]
[<p eid="para_93">How many gardaí work in the online child exploitation unit?</p>]
[<p eid="para_95">That is three people in total.</p>]
[<p eid="para_97">What is the total number, including civilians?</p>]
[<p eid="para_99">That brings it up to 78. How many people work in the Garda national cybercrime bureau?</p>]
[<p eid="para_101">I ask Mr. Daly to repeat those numbers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">I am trying to get a sense of the overall numbers. For the pilot programme in New Ross and Ballincollig, are they extrapolated from the numbers Mr. Gubbins has outlined?</p>]
[<p eid="para_105">How many are in Ballincollig and New Ross?</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">That is three.</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">I want to speak to the issue of resourcing. The numbers are quite finite. Given the scale of the challenge it could be argued that the numbers are quite small. What is the business case being made for additional resources? Is such a business case being made?</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">I appreciate that point. I am trying to ascertain what the numeric strength is and I recognise that other resources are deployed as needed. Will Mr. O'Driscoll give me a perspective on how the relationship with Internet service providers, ISP, of Ireland works with regard to a notice and take-down procedure? The Hotline, as I understand it, will serve an ISP with a notice of removal or take-down. Mr. O'Driscoll referred to a blocking mechanism. Maybe this is a false analogy, but it is a bit like when I block somebody who is abusive to me on social media, such as Twitter of Facebook, it does not necessarily stop the activity. How is the activity investigated? It is one thing to block it, but how is it stopped and investigated? How do gardaí investigate, since their jurisdiction is the Republic of Ireland and the crime may be transnational? What is the nature of the investigation and how are crimes investigated subsequently? Is it merely a blocking mechanism or is it subsequently reported to other jurisdictions? For those instances that happen in Ireland, specifically, how many investigations are under way at present and how many cases are before the courts for this type of activity?</p>]
[<p eid="para_114">How many sites are hosted in Ireland?</p>]
[<p eid="para_116">Can Mr. Daly say if it is in fives or tens?</p>]
[<p eid="para_118">How many cases come before the courts?</p>]
[<p eid="para_120">The witnesses made a statement on the Communications (Retention of Data) Act. There is a specific section in their statement, "However, if internet providers fail to provide the Garda Síochána with data pursuant to the Communication (Retention of Data) Act 2011, our ability to identify people involved in the sexual exploitation of children or the distribution of child pornography on the internet will be restricted". Is there a lacuna in the law relating to this? Have there been incidences where ISPs have refused to yield information? I am trying to get a closer interpretation of that statement.</p>]
[<p eid="para_123">We would all acknowledge that the work of the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland and Hotline is laudable and proactive. There are mobile telephony and Internet service providers. The witnesses made a very pertinent point about how technology has moved on. A phone is no longer merely a phone but it is also a computer. Does the Communications (Retention of Data) Act as it relates to this subject matter pertain to mobile telephony too with regard to the retention of data?</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">My point, to be helpful, is that it would be very good to have a perspective in order for this committee to make determinations and recommendations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_239">I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting today. This is an insightful discussion and it builds a deeper understanding for members of the committee. I wish to get a sense of the nature of the collaboration. There is the ISPAI, the Garda, CyberSafeIreland, the Office for Internet Safety and so forth. There are myriad organisations. What level of collaboration takes place? There are a finite number of actors in the field but what level of real collaboration is there at present? Perhaps the representatives of CyberSafeIreland will respond to that first. Do the witnesses have a genuine critique of the system as it exists?</p>]
[<p eid="para_242">I am glad the witness mentioned Webwise because I intended to ask about the office's relationship with same. The witness speaks a great deal about education and continuing professional development, CPD, in schools for teachers. There is a conflict in my mind around this. I am a parent. Is there an onus on the parent to have the primary responsibility in respect of educating his or her child about Internet safety? To say that I have mental blockages about using the technology and so forth is not really sufficient in this day and age. A parent teaches his or her child the safe cross code, road safety and all sorts of other safety mechanisms. I have a perception, and the witnesses can correct me if I am wrong, that sometimes parents will say that it is the role of the school through the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, Webwise and so forth to educate their children on Internet safety. Webwise does not necessarily reach every school and not every teacher has taken up the CPD. Representatives of Webwise have appeared before the committee. If the CPD is not inculcated within the teaching and academic institutions as a core subject, it is likely that there will be a great deal of slippage in this regard. What is the witnesses' perspective on that? I believe every teacher should be equipped compulsorily, but how do we marry the role of the teacher with the role of the parent? I am sorry if I am a little long-winded but the witnesses understand what I am saying.</p>]
[<p eid="para_244">There is a role for schools. The school is probably the primary institution with which parents will interact in respect of their children up to the age of 18 years. We are talking about distilling this down and creating a platform nationally whereby parents voluntarily interact with schools and the programmes are delivered through that. Parents go to parent-teacher meetings. There is no reason that on one night per year there could not be outreach programme, for example, for every school in the country. It would only require two or three hours. Parents would interact with each other thereafter and natural collaborations would begin to build up through parents interacting with each other. If it were to be distilled down to community level, it would not take a massive amount of resources or money to do that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_250">I hope Ms Cooney will forgive me for cutting across her but time is limited. The one thing I have noted is that teachers need access to materials. Ms Cooney is, in effect, saying that it is not only about access to materials but about the confidence to be able to-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_252">-----have the pedagogical skills and understand the content in order to deliver it. That is certainly an issue which this committee could take forward. I am very conscious that the Chairman has to progress the agenda. I want to speak very specifically about the research component of this issue. These are straightforward questions. Are funding lines available through the Irish Research Council for the area the witnesses have spoken about?</p>]
[<p eid="para_254">There is no bespoke funding line. Are there any funding lines from industry? For instance, is there any funding from the bodies represented by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, which is a global body, or from any of the top global Internet-based companies, nine out of the top 10 of which have facilities in Ireland? Has Dr. Brennan, or anyone from the academic side, approached these companies and told them that they need to start cutting checks? Forgive me if I mix up qualitative and quantitative research. It is okay to do a kind of surface mapping of Whatsapp, but to drill down one needs proper quantitative analysis of what exactly is happening in this field. Good research leads to good policy. Has the Government made any funding available in this space through the Department of Justice and Equality? It seems to me that for small amounts of money - a grant of €10,000 here, a €50,000 grant there - a very solid research platform could be created within the academic field, where there is collaboration between UCC, DIT and so on.</p>]
[<p eid="para_256">If that is mapped, could the witnesses drop the committee a line on where the research landscape is at the moment?</p>]
[<p eid="para_258">Will Ms Cooney provide the committee with a copy of that research?</p>]
[<p eid="para_260">If I understand correctly, of the €3.9 million which is available for funding under the EU Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, programme-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_262">What is the Office of Internet Safety's budget line at the moment? How much is in the kitty?</p>]
[<p eid="para_264">It is just for staffing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_266">The bodies are the National Parents Council, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Professional Development Services for Teachers-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_268">This is the point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_270">I will make one final point and then I am finished. We have a disparate system but everyone is working with the same aim in mind. There might be a role for this committee in trying to map the system. If we can simply map what is happening throughout the Irish landscape, we can begin to work on solutions and outcomes.</p>]
