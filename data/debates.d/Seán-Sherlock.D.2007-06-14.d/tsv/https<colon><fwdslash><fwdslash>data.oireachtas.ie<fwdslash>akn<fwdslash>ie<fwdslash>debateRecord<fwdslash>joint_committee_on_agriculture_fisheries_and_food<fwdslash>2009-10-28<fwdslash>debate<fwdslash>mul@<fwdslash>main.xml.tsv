SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I welcome Mr. Gunning and Mr. Egan to the meeting.  My first question relates to the target of planting 15,000 hectares, which, if Government policy was being implemented, should be achieved every year.  Why has that target not been reached?  What is Coillte's response to the failure to do so if that is the supposedly sustainable target for the country per annum?  COFORD's research indicates that if 15,000 hectares were planted per year, 490 jobs would be created to manage, harvest and process the timber.  If the target is not reached, what influence has Coillte in the failure to do so?I refer to by-products.  Had we still been in a boom, Coillte's profits for 2008 would be significantly better and they would not have reduced by 77%.  Has the organisation hedged too much of its resources in the construction industry and not enough in the bio-fuels sector, given the renewable targets that must be met by 2020?  According to its annual report, Coillte is a long way from meeting these targets such as 12% renewable heat by 2020 and 5% by 2010.  I accept those are national targets and Coillte does not have responsibility for the country in this regard.  However, in the context of its product mix, the organisation has massive potential to exploit alternative energy sources.  It has not operated at its potential for the past number of years to reach the targets or to maximise profit.Mr. Gunning mentioned the projections for the annual report due in April 2010.  Will the organisation operate at a loss for 2009 or will it still make a profit?  Will the downturn in the construction industry be reflected in the returns for this year in the annual report?The most important issue is the rate of afforestation.  The output for 2009 will represent 1% of GDP, according to COFORD.  The forestry sector is underperforming and perhaps there was too much hedging in the expansion of the construction industry.  While Mr. Gunning referred to the two ancillary companies and Coillte had to enter that market, nobody could predict the rate of the crash and, therefore, the impact on the organisation's projects.  Should it have a wider product mix and refer more to the renewables sector?  This sector will be the jewel in the organisation's crown in the future and perhaps more should have been done in this regard over the past two years.  While I am a layman and not a businessman, there are legitimate questions about this in the semi-State sector.I am an absolute believer in Coillte's recreation policy because I have first-hand experience of the product it delivers, particularly in north Cork and the Ballyhoura Mountains.  It is a fantastic product and I wish Coillte well with that.  Coillte has underperformed in the renewable sector.  Will the delegates comment on that?Perhaps the delegation can explain something to me with regard to sequestering carbon and the pre-1990 targets.  What is the potential for Coillte for offsetting carbon?  Currently, must we rely on pre-1990 forestry growth rates in order to be included for offsetting?  If we continue growing more trees, can we offset our CO2 emissions and can that offset be used in the accounting in terms of reaching our goals, for example the post-Copenhagen goals?  If that is the case, will Coillte have a greater role to play?The afforestation goal is approximately 300,000 hectares per annum over the next two decades and Forestry 2030 has a target of approximately 1 million hectares by 2030.  Is that an achievable or realistic target?  Given the product mix and corporate strategy being adopted by Coillte and given it has a virtual monopoly in the area, will we reach that target by then?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	If afforestation is being used for carbon sequestration purposes, will cutting not have an affect in the sense that it increases CO2 emissions?
