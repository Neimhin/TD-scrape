SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2022-11-23T18:30:00+00:00	There will be ample opportunity for Deputies to come back in. Proposers of amendments may speak three times. There is plenty of time to make points. Please allow the Minister to continue without interruption.
SeanSherlock	Acting Chairman (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2022-11-23T18:50:00+00:00	On the grouping of amendments, it is my understanding that as we are discussing amendment No. 7, Deputy Boyd Barrett has the right to come back in for a third time. Other speakers have had their opportunity and the offer is to Deputy Boyd Barrett alone. That is the guidance I have received.
