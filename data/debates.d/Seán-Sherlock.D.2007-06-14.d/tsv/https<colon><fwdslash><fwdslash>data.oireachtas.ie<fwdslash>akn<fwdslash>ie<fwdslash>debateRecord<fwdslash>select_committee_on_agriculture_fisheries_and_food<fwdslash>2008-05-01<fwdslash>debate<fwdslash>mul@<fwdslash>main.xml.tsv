[<p eid="para_41">I too welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and departmental officials to today's meeting.  I share some of the concerns of Deputy Creed.  I am a novice in this process.  It would have been very beneficial for someone like me to have had a pre-briefing on the mechanism, without necessarily having had sight of the figures.  That would have provided some assistance in understanding the process.  That is not a criticism but an observation.</p>, <p eid="para_42">I have a number of issues of concern from a global perspective regarding the state of play <i>vis-à-vis</i> global agriculture.  There is an increase in food prices.  There are issues regarding food safety and there are serious issues on where Irish agribusiness will be in 20 years.  I am not satisfied, notwithstanding the increases in output, that there is enough of a political imperative with regard to food labelling.  Nothing in the Minister’s statement gives me solace in that regard, given that those involved in Irish agriculture are operating at the highest standards.  There has still been no substantive political movement towards ensuring the labelling regime.  Ultimately that has a bearing on agricultural output and should have been provided for in today’s statement.</p>, <p eid="para_43">I know I am jumping from a very general point to a very specific one.  Regarding installation aid to bring more younger farmers into the loop, the fact that land needs to be owned or leased for a maximum of ten years is very restrictive and should be considered in one of the specific programmes mentioned by the Minister.  As we go through the programme, these issues will become more apparent and I hope we will have an opportunity to address specific issues in that regard.  There is major potential for Irish agriculture.  More than 230,000 people are employed, whether through agrifood or directly in production.  It represents approximately 11% of total employment in the State.  It is a vital component of the economy.  While I am glad that output is increasing, I would like to see more forward planning or long-term strategic thinking.  I would like the Minister to address some of those issues.</p>]
[<p eid="para_106">What is the state of play on expenditure on TB and brucellosis eradication?  Are the results as desired by the Minister?  Will she comment on the effects of expenditure to promote animal welfare in general?</p>]
[<p eid="para_160">If we are talking about the ultimate output for agriculture, it could be argued that that will be affected by country of original labelling.</p>]
[<p eid="para_162">It may be joined-up Government but I understand the initial proposal was made in January.</p>]
[<p eid="para_164">It is a major political imperative and someone needs to grasp the nettle, so to speak.</p>]
[<p eid="para_166">It makes total sense.</p>]
[<p eid="para_237">On subhead H, I refer to horticulture, organic capital expenditure and organic current expenditure.  There have been dramatic increases under these headings and I assume the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for food and horticulture, Deputy Trevor Sargent, has been influential in this regard.  The Minister should explain exactly what these increases relate to, particularly in respect of organic capital expenditure and horticulture.  While everyone welcomes increases in this regard, I seek a breakdown in terms of the expenditure for the aforementioned three items.</p>]
[<p eid="para_249">Members appreciate the target and I do not believe anyone would oppose the setting of a target in the first instance.  However, I refer to the current climate in which the price of staples for ordinary working people, such as potatoes and bread, is increasing year on year as food inflation increases.  As for the Department's thinking, will a point be reached at which the focus of spending would be towards ensuring the staples are maintained at affordable levels?  I appreciate the Minister is seeking to strike a balance——</p>]
[<p eid="para_251">I appreciate there is an organic market and a local food economy that must be supported.  However, a balance also must be struck to ensure the great majority of the population can have staples at an affordable price.</p>]
[<p eid="para_254">I appreciate that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_304">The Exchequer's contribution to forestry in 2008 is €113 million, if I am reading the capital output figures correctly.  A sum of €98 million of that will cover the afforestation grants.  There is a provision of €10 million for structural initiatives and €5.6 million for bio-fuels, including willow and miscanthus, and the bio-fuel national top-up grant, as well as biomass.  Is there scope for increasing the provisions for biomass and bio-fuels to encourage greater growth in that sector?  Given the Kyoto targets and the scope for forestry to reduce carbon emissions, should we be doing more in terms of marketing initiatives to get more people into the forestry sector?  I am not convinced that enough is being done in that regard.  Forestry is potentially a major growth industry.</p>]
[<p eid="para_375">I thank the Minister but I raised a point on——</p>]
[<p eid="para_377">I do not want to go through it now.  I can talk to one of the officials at some stage.  I would welcome the opportunity to have the Minister visit the committee to discuss the state of the aquaculture sector.</p>]
