[<p eid="para_437">Achieving savings in the Department's budget has required difficult decisions.  Despite pressures on spending, the Government has shielded to the greatest extent possible front line services in schools.  The Government has and will continue to prioritise targeted supports for schools, with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage through the DEIS programme and action plan.  More than €158 million is currently being provided by way of additional resources and supports for primary and post-primary schools, including DEIS.  This is only part of an overall amount of some €700 million, which continues to be provided to tackle educational disadvantage across the full education spectrum, from pre-school to further and higher education.  This includes schemes such as the school completion programme and disadvantaged youth, which now come under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the school meals programme, which comes under the Department of Social Protection.</p>, <p eid="para_438">It is important to note that a key aspect of the EU-IMF programme of support and Ireland's overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll.  This is a particular challenge for the education sector, considering that a third of all public sector employees work there.  Furthermore, unlike in other countries, our school-going population is rising rapidly and places must be provided for the extra 70,000 pupils arriving in our schools in the next six years.  Providing for increased enrolments is a key priority but making some adjustment to teacher numbers is unavoidable, given budgetary constraints.</p>, <p eid="para_439">The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.  We are conscious of the concerns of some schools which will be adversely affected by the withdrawal of posts under previous disadvantaged schemes, and with these concerns in mind we have made clear since the budget announcement that this matter would be managed as sensitively as possible.  To this end the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has met school principals, teachers, parents and community representatives in recent weeks to hear their concerns and clarify the position of announced changes in the 2012 budget to posts allocated to schools under previous schemes to tackle educational disadvantage.</p>, <p eid="para_440">The Minister has held many meetings with members of my parliamentary party and all Government colleagues, who have performed an invaluable service in assisting him in developing an understanding of the impact of the proposed measures in these schools.  It is in this context that the Department of Education and Skills has been directed to report to the Minister within the next four weeks on the position of DEIS band one and band two schools which currently have posts under schemes predating DEIS.  That will done in the context of staff allocations due to issue to all schools in the coming weeks.  We look forward to receiving that report and continuing the process of engagement with schools on the impact of the measures announced in the 2012 budget.</p>]

[<p eid="para_721">I move: "That Report Stage be taken now."</p>]
[<p eid="para_725">I thank Deputy O'Dea for his remarks and accept in good faith the manner in which he proposed his amendment.  It is our intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2011 by way of an order as soon after the enactment of the Patents Amendment Act 2011 as possible.  I am very conscious of the points the Deputy has made in that sense.</p>, <p eid="para_726">I welcome the opportunity to bring this Bill through Report Stage in this House.  The purpose of the Bill is to make the necessary changes to the Patents Act 1992 to provide for the ratification by Ireland of the London Agreement, which aims to reduce the cost to applicants of the European patent process by reducing the requirements to file translations of the granted patents under the European Patent Convention.  It is a technical Bill that deletes references in the existing Act to the requirement for translations to validate a European patent in Ireland.  The short Bill makes changes to the Patents Act 1992 that relate exclusively to the European Patent Convention.</p>, <p eid="para_727">In this instance it is necessary for the corresponding patent rules to be amended to bring them in line with the London Agreement.  The proposed amendments to the patent rules 1992 are being drafted.  It is my intention to commence the Act and the new patents amendment rules 2012 by way of an order as near to the enactment of the Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 as possible.  I thank the Deputies opposite and in particular Deputy O'Dea for their assistance in allowing us to introduce this legislation which strengthens the intellectual property infrastructure of Ireland, making Ireland a more competitive place to locate and manage intellectual property rights.</p>]
