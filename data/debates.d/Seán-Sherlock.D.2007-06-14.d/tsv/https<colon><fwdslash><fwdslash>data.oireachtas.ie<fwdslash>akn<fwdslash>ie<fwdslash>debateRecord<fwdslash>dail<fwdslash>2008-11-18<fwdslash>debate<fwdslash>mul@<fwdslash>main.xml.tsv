SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In light of the Law Reform Commission's report on vulnerable adults and the law, which has been published for some time, when will the mental capacity Bill be published?  Will that Bill make provision to make a person a ward of court?My second question relates to the animal welfare Bill.  Before I ask about the date for publication, I ask the Tánaiste what constitutes a consultation in anticipation of her answer.
