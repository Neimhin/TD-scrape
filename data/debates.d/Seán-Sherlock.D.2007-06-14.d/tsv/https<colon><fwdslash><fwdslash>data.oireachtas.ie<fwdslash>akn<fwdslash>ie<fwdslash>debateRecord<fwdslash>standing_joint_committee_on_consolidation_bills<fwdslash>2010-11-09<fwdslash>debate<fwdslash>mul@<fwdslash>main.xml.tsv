[<p eid="para_9">I second that nomination.</p>]
[<p eid="para_14">Amendments Nos. 1, 6 and 8.</p>]
[<p eid="para_20">To satisfy my curiosity, why was amendment No. 1 ruled out of order when it is more of a semantic amendment than a substantive one?</p>]
[<p eid="para_45">I move amendment No. 2:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2010.49.dail.3.amd_2"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_46">In page 18, subsection (1), to delete line 28 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_47">" "repealed enactment" means the Value Added Tax Act 1972 repealed by <i>section 122;”</i>
</p>, <p eid="para_48">This is a drafting amendment.  As it stands the definition of "repealed enactment" refers to section 121, which defines it for the purposes of Part 14, however, the expression "repealed enactment" is used outside Part 14 for example, in section 15(5) <i>(a).  </i>It seems to us more appropriate to delete section 121 and simply define “repealed enactment” in Part 1.</p>]
[<p eid="para_51">I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p>]
[<p eid="para_73">I move amendment No. 4:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2010.49.dail.3.amd_4"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_74">In page 59, subsection (1), lines 9 to 23, to delete paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_75">"(<i>a</i>) zero per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to goods in the circumstances specified in <i>paragraphs 1(1) </i>to <i>(3)</i>, <i>3(1) </i>and <i>(3) </i>and <i>7(1) </i>to <i>(4) </i>and <i>(6) </i>of <i>Schedule 2 </i>or of goods or services of a kind specified in the other paragraphs of that Schedule;</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_76">(<i>b</i>) 4.8 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to the supply of livestock and live greyhounds and to the hire of horses;</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_77">(<i>c</i>) 13.5 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable in relation to goods or services of a kind specified in <i>Schedule 3</i>;</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_78">(<i>d</i>) 21 per cent of the amount on which tax is chargeable other than in relation to goods or services on which tax is chargeable at any of the rates specified in <i>paragraphs (a)</i>, <i>(b) </i>and <i>(c)</i>.”.</p>, <p eid="para_79">This is a drafting amendment.  We are setting out a more logical listing in numerical order.  A logical listing of the rates should be in order of amount from 0% to 21%.  This is basically the reasoning.</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">The longer I spend in this institution the more I am beginning to realise that parallel logical positions are often taken.  I accept what the Minister is saying and I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.</p>]
[<p eid="para_86">Is there scope for me to come at this again at the next Stage?  I accept at one level that the Chairman maintains there are substantive amendments and he has ruled some of them out of order.  Is it possible for the Opposition to reserve the right to take a view on this in the intervening period and then come back on Report Stage?</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">I move amendment No. 7:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2010.49.dail.3.amd_7"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_91">In page 99, lines 12 to 16, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_92">"(2) An invoice shall be stored within the State unless—</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_93">(<i>a</i>) it is stored by electronic means in a manner which conforms with requirements laid down by the Revenue Commissioners in that respect,</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_94">or</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_95">(<i>b</i>) the storing of the invoice is otherwise in accordance with the agreement of the Commissioners and is subject to any conditions set by them.”.</p>, <p eid="para_96">This is a drafting amendment.  At the moment the subsection could be deemed to be contradictory because it states "any invoice...shall be stored within the State" but the phrase "may be stored outside the State" is used afterwards.  We propose a re-draft which makes the exceptions to storing within the State clearer and which makes more sense grammatically as well.  It is more of a semantic amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">I appreciate that.  The logic of the amendment is based on the recent Data Retention Act which, although it was designed for specific counter-terrorism purposes and to assist Garda investigations, the issue here is still the retention of data and if it should be stored for a specified time.</p>]

</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_103">In page 164, line 29, to delete "Tax" and substitute "Value-added tax chargeable by virtue of this Act".</p>, <p eid="para_104">This is also a drafting amendment.  It is not strictly necessary having regard to the definition of tax but section 106 as it stands does not read well in our view.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I accept that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_111">We have withdrawn our opposition to this section of the Bill.</p>]
[<p eid="para_125">Our logic is the same.  The words "in so far as it is unrepealed" are redundant when the whole Act is being repealed.</p>]
