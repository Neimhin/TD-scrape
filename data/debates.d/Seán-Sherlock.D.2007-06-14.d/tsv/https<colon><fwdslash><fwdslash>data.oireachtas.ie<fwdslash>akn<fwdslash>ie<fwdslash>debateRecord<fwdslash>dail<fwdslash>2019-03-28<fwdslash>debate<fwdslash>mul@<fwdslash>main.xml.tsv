SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T11:30:00+00:00	I wish Mr. Donal Hickey a pleasant retirement and acknowledge he is a gentleman, even though he may be a Ciarraíoch. We will all miss him around the Houses. I wish him well in his retirement.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T11:30:00+00:00	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and appreciate his latitude.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T11:30:00+00:00	There has always been hearty banter between Donal and me, my being a Corkman and his being a Ciarraíoch. It has always been in good jest. What is the status of safeguarding in Scouting Ireland based on the Minister's current understanding?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T11:30:00+00:00	What exactly is the Minister expecting from Scouting Ireland this week? What report is it? Is it Mr. Elliott's review? I wanted to seek clarification on that very point.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T11:30:00+00:00	My questions do not deal with governance but with safeguarding. The Minister came into the House recently and made a very strong statement on overnight trips for scouts. Some of the issues are now being worked through, and we hope we have reached a more positive space with regard to Tusla's interaction with Scouting Ireland.All Members wish for some comfort to be given to the thousands of families with children and members of which are volunteers that Scouting Ireland is a safe place to be. All Members believe it to be a safe place, but there are some inherent risks. However, definitive answers from the Minister regarding the Tusla review of supervision of children are required. She has given no indication so far today in that regard. She discussed governance and the review by Ms Jillian van Turnhout. However, I wish to know where we are in regard to the safeguarding piece. Mr. Ian Elliot has been investigating historical cases. Is he to report directly to the Department? Where are we in terms of the quality of the engagement or actions arising from the engagement between Tusla and Scouting Ireland?
