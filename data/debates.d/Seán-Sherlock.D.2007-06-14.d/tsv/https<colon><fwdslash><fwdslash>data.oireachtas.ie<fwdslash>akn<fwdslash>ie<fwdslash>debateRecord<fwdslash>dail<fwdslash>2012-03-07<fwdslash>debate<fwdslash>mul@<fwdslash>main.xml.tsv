SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Is the Deputy willing to yield to allow me to make a debating point?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputy sincerely.  While I respect what he is saying, it should be acknowledged that, while in power, his party caused this country to be reduced almost to penury and signed up to a memorandum of understanding.  In discussing the situation in Greece, the European Union and the treaty we must not revise our history.  The Deputy should acknowledge the factors that lead to the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Our economic sovereignty has been lost as a result of the actions of his party.
