[<p eid="para_828">I express our sadness at the passing of Dr. Martin O'Donnell of Charleville, father of Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, our colleague in the House. Dr. O'Donnell was one of the founders of the Charleville and District Mentally Handicapped Children's Association, which was the forerunner of St. Joseph's Foundation as we know it today. I was particularly heartened to hear the Minister of State tonight mentioning Cooleens House and St. Joseph's Foundation. I take some solace from her speech that she is very much aware of St. Joseph's Foundation and its work, thanks in no small part to the late Dr. Martin O'Donnell and his team. A lovely article in the <i>Limerick Leader </i>today contained a quote from a local who said that the late Dr. O'Donnell brought children out of the attic in 1968. We are still here tonight discussing these issues, which may be an indictment on all of us.</p>, <p eid="para_829">There has never been a greater consciousness around these issues and around ensuring we can advocate for people and continue in the spirit of a man who was truly respected, who had great passion and compassion for the people he served as a GP. The article speaks of the 50th anniversary celebration of St. Joseph's Foundation where it is said that he remembers Dr. O'Donnell saying the highlight of his career working with those with special needs was when it was recognised they could get their first holy communion. We have come a long way since then but we have a long way to go.</p>, <p eid="para_830"> I recognise the Minister of State's integrity. I note that Deputy Michael Moynihan, who will chair the disability committee, is also present. We can do good work and we are already seeing an evidence base for an increase in resources. That is plain for everybody to see. This is a non-partisan issue. If we can continue in the vein of people such as Dr. O'Donnell, we will do some good work. I am particularly heartened that the Minister of State mentioned Cooleens House. That is evidence she is across that specific issue in north Cork and is cognisant of the impact of the loss of respite care and the effect it is having on, for instance, the 33 people who use it in the context of Cooleens House. I pay tribute to Dr. O'Donnell and his family, to Mrs. O'Donnell and their five children and offer condolences to our colleague, Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, on his loss.</p>]
