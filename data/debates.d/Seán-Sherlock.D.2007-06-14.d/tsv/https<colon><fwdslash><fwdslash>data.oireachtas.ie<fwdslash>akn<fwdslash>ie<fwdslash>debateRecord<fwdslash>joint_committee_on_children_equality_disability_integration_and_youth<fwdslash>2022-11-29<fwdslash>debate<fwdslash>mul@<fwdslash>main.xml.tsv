[<p eid="para_66">I have found this interaction with our witnesses very informative. I had not been conscious of the parent in all of this. I have looked matters through the prism of people who come to our constituency offices, and very often it is about a social protection query or a medical card query, but once one starts to open the box one sees that there are other issues, but one never really fully engages with the trauma or other difficulties that a parent would have in these circumstances. This meeting has been very useful for me in being more conscious about that from now on.</p>, <p eid="para_67"> I will not single anybody out in particular, and not to exclude anybody else, but the Clarecare model seems to be most sympathetic and empathetic model. Is this the model that can be replicated and transposed throughout the State? I am not an expert, but if that was the model that could be used it seems to me to really to get down into the weeds of an issue. It really forms the basis of very strong relationships and understanding of people's issues. It probably pulls a lot of information out of people that heretofore they may not have felt the capacity to give. If that was to be the model, I believe it would be a very good model. I would love to have the witnesses' perspectives on that. This is not to denigrate or to undermine anybody else's potential model. I would just like to get our guests' perspectives on whether that could be the model. I believe it is a great model. That is my first question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_71">It does. We must understand and appreciate the service has only been operational for a matter of weeks really. It is an iterative process. I absolutely acknowledge that.</p>, <p eid="para_72"> My second and final point is in relation to the courts. We have been talking about reform of the courts for donkey's years and for decades. I believe that we think too rigidly in this country about how the Courts Service operates: one must present in an adversarial fashion in a building that is very clearly identified. In my constituency of Cork East in Youghal I have seen two instances where domestic violence issues and family related issues have been consolidated into Cork city. For a lot of people that might not seem so far away but for a lot of families it is a gargantuan task to have to think about how they will engage with those services. Similarly, in my home town of Mallow the District Court will close for six months for refurbishment, which is necessary, but some of the services I have just mentioned will now be consolidated in Cork city for the duration. I do not think there is an appreciation by the Courts Service of the effect this will have on families. I do not see why one cannot build or refurbish buildings within towns throughout the country that could hold these hearings. The settings are vitally important and the representatives here have made very strong reference to that. I believe needs to be a modal shift in how we think about courts, the architecture around courts, and the nature of the buildings themselves. I welcome the representatives' interventions and their observations in that regard. I am hopeful that the current Minister, who has set out her stall with regard to domestic violence in particular, would be mindful of the need for family courts to be designed in such a way as to ensure they are conducive for families who engage with them. I thank our witnesses for their submissions here today.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">Particularly on the Courts Service.</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">To be fair, while one cannot say there has been a sea change, there has certainly been a shift in terms of the appointment of judges whose legal experience is grounded in family law and that is making a difference.</p>]
