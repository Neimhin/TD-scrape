[<p eid="para_21">I second the proposal to suspend Standing Orders.</p>]
[<p eid="para_74">I too welcome the contributors.  It would appear there is no major urgency about this proposal under the French Presidency.  However, it may be dealt with by the subsequent Presidency.  If the ban on AMT poultry has been in place since 1997, why is the Commission now seeking to amend regulations that would allow for a greater percentage of poultry imports from third countries, particularly given the inherent risks of such imports?  I do not understand why this proposal is being put before member states.  Perhaps I misunderstand the proposal, but my reading of it suggests that it is paving the way for an increase in imports of poultry from third countries.  There has been, heretofore, a ban on particular types of poultry products, particularly with regard to AMT.</p>, <p eid="para_75">I have questions which do not relate to this specific proposal but to the wider issue of country of origin labelling.  Could Department officials outline to this committee the current EU view on that issue, particularly within the context of this regulation?  Is the European Commission considering the whole culture of regulation with regard to country of origin labelling?  I do not know whether it is possible for the witnesses to talk about the political nuances of this issue; it may not be.  However, certain countries clearly are opposed to any change in the regime, and that may be why the Irish Government is finding it difficult to fight this issue politically at European level.  To make a political point, what has occurred in Cappoquin is largely owing to the fact that the current EU regime does not properly police country of origin labelling.</p>, <p eid="para_76">I welcome the presentation to the committee.  If we read between the lines, however, it becomes clear there is no political urgency to the proposal and, in any event, there seems to be a blocking minority, or possibly a majority.  Perhaps instead we should discuss the issue of country-of-origin labelling and examine what is happening in the areas of food safety, consumer protection and, I am not ashamed to add, the protection of Irish markets.</p>]
[<p eid="para_90">On a point of order, is it possible for those figures to be made available to committee members?</p>]
[<p eid="para_98">The witnesses came in to talk about one issue but they will be sidetracked which is inevitable given the nature of the subject matter.  I was interested to hear there was consultation between the Department and the Commission on the food labelling regime, that the proposals put forward by Ireland were turned down by the Commission in May or June, that a new set of proposals were put forward and the Department is now expecting a response to them.</p>, <p eid="para_99">I asked about the political situation <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> support throughout all member states for a complete overhaul of the regime.  A witness stated that certain boundaries had been reached in the discussion and I did not quite follow the thinking on that.  We are talking about the importation of foodstuffs, particularly poultry from 25 countries, and we are not exactly sure from where it is all coming.  The question is whether there is political will or a will within the Commission to change the regime to ensure every consumer knows exactly what he or she is purchasing and from where the product originated.</p>, <p eid="para_100">When do the witnesses expect the timeframe for that consultation process with the Commission to end?  Will there be further consultation or will it give rise to a new Commission proposal?</p>]
[<p eid="para_115">I thank Mr. Cronin for his frank reply.  Is it fair to ask why there was resistance at Commission level to Ireland introducing domestic legislation relating to country of origin labelling?</p>]
[<p eid="para_127">Would it be appropriate to write to the Minister to ask him to come to the committee to discuss this matter?</p>]
[<p eid="para_145">I will not labour the point.  Deputy McGrath has proposed a six month extension of the deadline applying to the scheme.  This was echoed by Deputy Creed and I support that for the pragmatic reasons outlined.  The Labour Party would support the proposals also.</p>]
