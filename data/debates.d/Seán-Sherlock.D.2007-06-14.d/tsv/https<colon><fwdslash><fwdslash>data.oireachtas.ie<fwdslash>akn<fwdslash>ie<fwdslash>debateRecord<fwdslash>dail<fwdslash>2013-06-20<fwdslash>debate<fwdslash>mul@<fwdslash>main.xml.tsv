[<p eid="para_85">The Deputy needs to listen to the reply.</p>]
[<p eid="para_883">Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett might like to save them for Committee Stage when the Minister will be present.</p>]
[<p eid="para_887">The Bill has been brought forward to provide a statutory basis for the multi-annual medium-term expenditure framework. I am pleased Deputies have engaged on the Bill and would like to respond briefly to some of the points raised on Second Stage and which we can debate further on Committee Stage next week.</p>, <p eid="para_888"> Deputy Fleming raised the fact that non-voted expenditure is outside the scope of the expenditure ceilings being legislated for in the Bill. The position is that non-voted expenditure represents expenditure which the Oireachtas has declared by law is to be paid from the Central Fund without annual reference to the Dáil. These are items which are a permanent charge on the State revenues and represent those services which are payable out of the Central Fund by the continuing authority of statutes and are not, therefore, subject to the same type of annual process as voted expenditure. The largest item is the service of the national debt. Other items include Ireland's contribution to the EU budget; the salaries, pensions and allowances of the President, Judiciary and Comptroller and Auditor General; and the expenses of returning officers. It is not true the Dáil is not made aware of Central Fund activity. It is regularly reported in Exchequer statements and the Department of Finance each year publishes detailed accounts of the Central Fund for the previous year, known as the finance accounts. The accounts are prepared under section 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 and contain detailed analysis and classification of receipts and issues of the Central Fund as well as details of the national debt. They must be laid before Dáil Éireann not later than 30 September. The Bill does not deal with debt service or other Central Fund charges and consequently does not propose any change to this long-standing practice, which is in accordance with the Constitution.</p>, <p eid="para_889"> The Government is in favour of, and is taking further actions to bring about, improvements in fiscal reporting and fiscal transparency generally.</p>, <p eid="para_890">This will enable Ireland to realise a number of benefits from enhanced fiscal disclosure, primarily in respect of the understanding of and access to fiscal information, which should help to promote and encourage market investment in Government debt.</p>, <p eid="para_891"> With this in mind, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with the Department of Finance and other agencies, will take appropriate steps to provide more comprehensive, timely and reliable data for fiscal decision making, demonstrate the Government's awareness and management of fiscal risks, promote a more informed public debate on fiscal policy challenges and choices, reassure markets of the overall sustainability of the public finances and facilitate compliance with current and future EU fiscal reporting requirements.</p>, <p eid="para_892"> Deputy McDonald raised the issue of equality budgeting, which we can discuss further on Committee Stage. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform considers the effect of measures across all elements of society when assessing proposals for changes in spending.</p>, <p eid="para_893"> Among other matters, Deputy Donnelly raised the issue of the timetable for the annual budgetary process. I am happy that the Government has reformed the process substantially and that, in line with our EU commitments, we will have this year's budget in October and the Revised Estimates will be published before the year end. As Deputies will acknowledge, this is an improvement on the present system, whereby the budget is in December and the Revised Estimates volume, REV, is discussed in the middle of the year.</p>]
[<p eid="para_895">In addition, an initiative has been introduced to allow committees to conduct an <i>ex ante</i> examination of the Votes for which they are responsible with the relevant Ministers. There is also a drive to produce published performance measurement information in the REV. The Department is engaging proactively with the Oireachtas committee secretariat to improve the timeliness and quality of the material being supplied to committees in consideration of the annual Estimates with a view to enhancing the understanding of these issues.</p>, <p eid="para_896"> On behalf of the Minister, I thank everyone who has contributed on the debate. These topics will be debated further with Deputies on Committee Stage.</p>]
[<p eid="para_897">I move:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_898">That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>a</i>) and (6)(<i>a</i>) and 126(1) of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.</p>]
[<p eid="para_909">I thank Deputy Buttimer for raising this Topical Issue. The HPSC collects data on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses. Data for 2012 showed that the total number of HIV infections reported in all years up to 2012 had risen to 6,629. While the annual numbers of newly diagnosed HIV infections had been decreasing since 2008, there was a slight increase in the overall numbers of new HIV diagnoses in 2012, amounting to 7%, as the Deputy stated.</p>, <p eid="para_910"> Of the new diagnoses, there were 166 among gay men, the highest number ever recorded in that risk group. This is the predominant mode of transmission of HIV in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_911">While some aspects of the prevention agenda have proven successful in the past and have reached large proportions of the population, the statistics continue to show that increasingly people are either not hearing or are choosing to disregard the messages, and are engaging in risky behaviours. We need to deliver targeted prevention programmes in order to address this situation through partnership between non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and the statutory services.</p>, <p eid="para_912"> The ongoing high incidence among the MSM group, specifically among the younger MSMs, is a particular cause for concern especially since the MSM group had responded well to awareness and prevention campaigns in the past. Clearly, not only must the messages reach the target audience, but they must make an impact when they do. We must do this in a cost-effective manner that delivers the biggest impact for investment.</p>, <p eid="para_913"> The Gay Health Network, GHN, and the HSE ran an awareness campaign specifically focused for men who have sex with men, or MSM. This campaign, Man2Man.ie, was promoted over a 12-month period, from December 2011 to December 2012, and comprised four phases, with key messages developed by a peer youth group facilitated by BeLonG To Youth Services. It is therefore very timely and relevant that tomorrow the HSE and the Gay Health Network will launch the results of the joint national HIV prevention and sexual health awareness programme for men who have sex with men. Subject to resources, it is hoped to extend this awareness campaign. The 11th annual Gay Health Forum programme targets younger MSMs and aims to raise awareness, build self-esteem and equip men to be able to make safer sex choices.</p>, <p eid="para_914"> In the area of responsible sexual behaviour, the ongoing stigma attached to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, STIs, is undoubtedly one of the underlying reasons for the ongoing high incidence level of new cases of HIV and other STIs. On the wider issue of sexual health, the Department of Health has established a high level steering group to oversee the drafting of a national sexual health strategy. It will focus on improving sexual health and well-being and will address the surveillance, testing, treatment and prevention of HIV and STIs, crisis pregnancy, and sexual health education and promotion. Moreover, the strategy will be in line with the framework for health and well-being, which provides a policy framework that addresses the wider determinants of health and health inequalities.</p>]
[<p eid="para_918">To reiterate, I agree wholeheartedly with the points made by Deputy Buttimer, specifically his point that 52% of those concerned are from the heterosexual community. We must bear that in mind in determining strategies.</p>, <p eid="para_919"> I am not aware of the membership of the high level group affected but I hope it is reflective of all communities. To reinforce the point made by Deputy Buttimer, there is a very strong role for NGOs to play in the health promotion agenda and in making progress on this issue. I acknowledge the points made.</p>, <p eid="para_920"> There is a role for this House, too, to be proactive in this area through the health committee and by whatever means possible. This is something that affects all of us.</p>]
[<p eid="para_928">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is attending an engagement in Brussels in his capacity as Minister for Defence. I thank Deputy Broughan for raising a matter of significant public importance.</p>, <p eid="para_929"> Extended periods of good weather are no excuse for the type of anti-social behaviour referred to by Deputy. The Minister has been informed by the Garda Commissioner that sufficient Garda resources were available and deployed to deal with all the incidents arising. The House will be aware that the Commissioner is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel and transport, throughout the organisation and the Minister has no direct function in this. Allocation of resources is constantly monitored by the Commissioner and his senior management in the context of demographics, crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies on a district, divisional and regional level to ensure optimal use of Garda resources.</p>, <p eid="para_930"> A regional operation plan called Operation Irene has commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region incorporating a range of policing actions to be implemented at identified hot spots, such as public parks, laneways and other open spaces, which may experience an upsurge in anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol consumption with the advent of milder weather, longer evenings and school holidays. The operation commenced on 1 June 2013 and will continue until 31 August 2013. Specifically in regard to the incidents at Howth and Portmarnock, gardaí established checkpoints to identify persons bringing alcohol into the areas in question. A number of arrests were made and significant quantities of alcohol were seized. There was close co-operation with local businesses and in one instance a store owner agreed to remove alcohol from sale, which is be commended.</p>, <p eid="para_931"> A range of strong legislative provisions is available to the Garda to combat anti-social behaviour. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides gardaí with powers to deal with anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking, including exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders for licensed premises and catering outlets following anti-social behaviour related offences. The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 provides for the seizure of alcohol in the possession of a person under the age of 18 which a garda suspects is for consumption in a public place. Gardaí may also seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property. Fixed charge notices may be issued for the offences of intoxication in a public place or disorderly conduct in a public place. This option has the benefit of a more efficient use of Garda and court resources, while also allowing an offender who complies with the notice to avoid a possible criminal record. While the is satisfied that sufficient legislative powers are in place to deal with these issues, he will keep the matter under close review in consultation with the Commissioner.</p>, <p eid="para_932"> Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the area concerned and that current structures in place meet the requirements of the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service. The Minister is determined that Garda resources will be used in the best, most effective and efficient manner. He remains confident that the primary Garda objective of combating crime will continue to be achieved and that notwithstanding the pressure on the public finances it will be possible for the force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities in a manner that will facilitate the prevention and detection of offences.</p>]
[<p eid="para_937">To be frank and honest with the Deputy, as I am not the line Minister I am not in a position to answer his specific questions about legislation on minimum pricing and transport. I will, however, refer his questions to the relevant Ministers.</p>, <p eid="para_938"> The Portmarnock and Howth areas are patrolled from Malahide and Howth Garda station. Malahide Garda station is in the Coolock Garda district, while Howth Garda station is in the Raheny district. These districts in turn form part of the Dublin metropolitan region north Garda division, the personnel strength of which was 733 on 30 April 2013. The personnel strength of Raheny and Coolock districts on 30 April were 176 and 221, respectively. The personnel strength of Malahide and Howth Garda stations were 36 and 40, respectively, on 30 April. While Malahide Garda station is not open on a 24-hour basis, this does not in any way diminish the policing service to the area in question because it frees up gardaí for operational policing.</p>]
[<p eid="para_950">I thank the Deputies for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. While I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Joan Collins regarding the presence of the senior Minister, it should be noted that I am a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills.</p>, <p eid="para_951"> The Government has maintained the €1.3 billion of annual funding for additional teaching resources and special needs assistants, SNAs, to support children with special educational needs at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. As the Tánaiste outlined to the House this morning, two out of every five adults working in our schools are solely dedicated to catering for the needs of children with special educational needs. We have no doubt about the value of the service that these staff provide and the value children and their parents derive from it. However, we are not in a position to dramatically increase the number of special needs assistants or any other service for reasons of which everyone is aware.</p>, <p eid="para_952"> No one can doubt the Government's commitment to special education. We have maintained the number of resource teachers and special needs assistants in the system since coming into office, despite enormous budgetary pressures in education and every other front-line service. That said, as a public representative, I am acutely aware of the concerns that have been expressed by parents and teachers in the media in the last 48 hours. We need to be clear in all debates, both in this House and elsewhere, about what these changes mean to ensure we avoid creating any unnecessary distress or alarm.</p>, <p eid="para_953"> The provision for SNA support for the next school year will remain at exactly the same level as the provision for the current school year. In its announcement the National Council for Special Education pointed to an increase in demand for resource teaching posts of the order of slightly more than 10%. Deputies will be aware that children with learning support and special educational needs are supported through learning support provision and NCSE-allocated resource teachers. In primary schools, learning support is provided through the general allocation model and similar direct provision is made in post-primary schools. These supports have been maintained for this year.</p>, <p eid="para_954"> The year-on-year growth in the overall student population is approximately 1.3%. This year, the demand for additional resource teachers from the NCSE has grown by more than 10%. While the NCSE is not yet in a position to provide a clear analysis of the underlying reasons for the very large increase in demand this year, it is clear that some of this increased demand arises from the migration of students from learning support provision to NCSE-allocated resource teacher support. This has created a significant additional pressure on the resources available to the NCSE. However, it should also have reduced, by equal measure, the pressure on the learning support resources already allocated to schools.</p>, <p eid="para_955"> Schools are encouraged to make maximum use of their resource and learning support teaching allocations through appropriate grouping and pairing of children, as appropriate, to ensure children do not lose out on teaching time. This is a vital point for parents to hear because an increase in the use of more collaborative, team-based approaches to teaching can help ensure that no child will face a significant reduction in the amount of time spent with his or her resource teacher.</p>]
[<p eid="para_961">I wish to reiterate two points. The year-on-year growth in the overall student population is 1.3% and the demand for additional teaching resources from the NCSE has grown by 10%. If we are to be serious about this issue, we must interpret that dynamic, which has not yet been done. The NCSE is not yet in a position to provide a clear analysis of the underlying reasons for the large increase in demand this year.</p>]
[<p eid="para_963">There is no overall reduction in resource teacher numbers for the coming school year. The number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education for allocation is 5,265, which is the same as last year. We must ensure we provide the service. That 5,265 is in addition to the 4,450 learning support teachers provided to all schools to support children with less complex learning needs, giving a total of 9,950 teachers for children with special educational needs. We need to hear from the NCSE as to why there is an increase in the overall population of 1.3% and the correlation between that and the massive increase in demand. That needs to be interpreted in some way.</p>, <p eid="para_964"> We must also ensure we get the best possible use of the €1.3 billion spent annually to support children with special educational needs. That is why we asked the NCSE last year to provide the policy advice on how students with special educational needs should be supported in future. One of the recommendations made by the NCSE in its policy advice is that a new model should be developed for the allocation of additional teaching resources to mainstream schools based on the profiled need of each school. On foot of this advice, the Minister asked the NCSE to proceed immediately to establish a working group to develop a proposal for consideration of a revised allocation mechanism as set out in the principal recommendation of the report. The aim of this new mechanism will be to ensure all learning support and resource teacher posts are allocated to schools in line with the schools' educational profile and need for such support rather than using other mechanisms such as the number of students in a school or the number of class teachers in a school.</p>, <p eid="para_965"> We are conscious there are challenges, and in making any changes to our supports for children with special educational needs, we also need to protect the gains we have made. Based on the allocation of resources from 1993 to now, there has been a massive increase in the level of support by the State for this area. I wish to give assurance that consultation will be a key aspect in the implementation of any of the recommendations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_975">I am rather disappointed because I thought there might be some imaginative ideas from the Deputy opposite in respect of discussing the actions the Government is taking to address the decline of town centres throughout the country. The Deputy referred to towns within his constituency which are probably similar in character to those in my constituency. I have analysed the situation in the towns I familiar with. During the boom years section 23 investments prevailed and in some instances one could argue these were put together by the party opposite. Now, there is a lack of occupancy in many of the buildings and there are empty storefronts throughout the country as a result of those taxation policies and the ill-informed Government policies of the past. They have led us to the point where many of our towns throughout the country have been hollowed out. If we are to have a reasonable and rational debate on this issue we should not start from the premise that economic history or the decline started only two years ago. We need to go back to 2007 and 2008 onwards in order to figure out where towns are now.</p>, <p eid="para_976"> I will give the response that I have been given on the rates issue. The action programme proposes rates harmonisation to cater for differences between annual rates on valuation of towns and counties. The approach of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to rates harmonisation seeks to ensure that, on the one hand, harmonisation does not lead to significant net loss of revenue in individual counties with consequential implications for services, and, on the other, increases in rates do not impact negatively on business and employment. In this regard local authorities have already been asked by the Department by way of circular to exercise restraint, and, where possible, reduce commercial rates in 2013. In fairness to many local authorities, this is what they have done or they have maintained rates at pre-existing levels.</p>, <p eid="para_977"> There are several issues. Why have town centres declined? There significant property rights in this country such that it is very difficult for a town council or a local authority to intervene where a building is not occupied or where it is falling into decline. The property rights of the owner seem to take precedence over the wider social responsibility in respect of the upkeep of the premises. That is one challenge for local authorities in terms of attracting new activity to the main street. There is also the fact that in any town throughout Ireland at the moment there is an increasing number of courier vans delivering goods that have been purchased online. This is having a serious impact in terms of high street retail sales as well. One need only discuss the matter with one's peers, friends and family to get a sense of how much activity is being driven online nowadays.</p>, <p eid="para_978"> The Deputy made a point about IDA visits. I have no specific knowledge in respect of IDA visits in the areas he referred to but I know from my experience in my region that there have been significant IDA visits. However, often the decision is made by the relevant person, business or company that they wish to locate to larger conurbations because of the particular type of business that is coming into Ireland at the moment, especially in the information and communications technology sector. In this sector, younger companies and younger people are looking to move to clusters around larger conurbations because it is deemed to be more attractive than locating to more regional towns such as my town of Mallow. That is a major challenge as well.</p>, <p eid="para_979"> Domestic demand has flat-lined. Therefore, to say that the Government is at fault for the flat-lining of domestic demand makes no sense. The Government, in fairness, is trying to create the jobs and replenish the jobs that were lost. A total of 250,000 jobs were lost between 2008 and 2011. Nobody can convince me that if one puts all one's eggs in the construction basket and if that fails, then it would not have a detrimental effect on retail or the shape of towns and retail businesses within towns. We must create the jobs to create domestic demand and we are making a good fist of it although it is taking time.</p>, <p eid="para_980">We must be more imaginative in terms of how the planning guidelines, which were issued recently, will impact. We must ensure, as per the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector in order that there is an advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres and contributing to a high standard of urban design.</p>]
[<p eid="para_982">The objective of the guidelines in the manual is to provide a clear framework for the continued development of the retail sector in a way that provides certainty for retailers and communities by strengthening national planning policy requirements for all planning authorities. The remainder of the response will be available to the Deputy. I will respond to Deputy Troy’s supplementary questions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_984">What ideas does Deputy Troy have?</p>]
[<p eid="para_986">I will stay here for a while.</p>]
[<p eid="para_990">When was that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_992">How long was Fianna Fáil in government?</p>]
[<p eid="para_994">Can Deputy Troy not understand the cynicism on this side of the House when we hear proposals of that nature?</p>]
[<p eid="para_998">The memorandum of understanding, MOU, signed by the troika introduced the property tax. Fianna Fáil negotiated the agreement with the troika, which is a sovereign agreement. I do not know the Deputy’s position on the property tax but it should be a significant revenue stream for local authorities and should redress the balance in terms of the burden over many decades that has been placed on businesses in regard to the annual rate of valuation. It will be an opportunity, for instance, for councillors of the Deputy’s party to have a clear policy document and prerogative on how it would be implemented at municipal or local authority level. I look forward to seeing some of those ideas within my own local authority, Cork County Council.</p>, <p eid="para_999"> The cost of parking is competitive in most towns around the country because there is good interaction between business and local authorities and many businesses are represented on local authorities. The issue is how one regenerates towns. I accept Deputy Troy’s point about energy costs, rates and ability to pay but the singular issue relates to demand. It will take some time to reverse the economic morass in which we find ourselves, such that we can create the jobs to ensure a sufficient level of retail demand. The approach is demand led. I acknowledge the points made about coming forward with ideas for empty shops but because of property rights the local authority cannot force specific types of retail activity into specific areas. It is a difficult thing to do.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1001">I beg your indulgence, Acting Chairman. We saw the demise of development contributions which were a major source of income for local authorities during the boom years. Cork County Council spent wisely on building up social infrastructure but the funding has practically disappeared. I agree that one can no longer rely on rate payers – businesspeople – to fund local government. That is why I look forward to Fianna Fáil members of local authorities supporting and striking the new rate on the property tax when the time comes in terms of the deviation that is allowable in the legislation to support the type of activity to which Deputy Troy refers.</p>]
