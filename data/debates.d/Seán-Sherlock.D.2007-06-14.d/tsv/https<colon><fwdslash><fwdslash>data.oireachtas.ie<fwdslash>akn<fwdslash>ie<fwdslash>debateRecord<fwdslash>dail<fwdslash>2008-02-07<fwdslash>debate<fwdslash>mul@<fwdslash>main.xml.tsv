[<p eid="para_165">I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time.</p>, <p eid="para_166">How can I speak for Paul Quinn in a way that does not patronise his family or politicise his memory?  How can I, who did not know him personally, possibly speak in a manner that will pay adequate tribute to his independence and single-mindedness that ultimately cost him his life?</p>, <p eid="para_167">I can only speak to the fact that neither he or his family nor the community of Cullyhanna has received justice.  If we are to subscribe to the ideals of the republic and all the beliefs going with it, we must speak up for Paul Quinn.  We must condemn, without equivocation, his murder, and that condemnation must come from all facets of the political spectrum.</p>, <p eid="para_168">If there are those who seek to equivocate, they must reverse their position.  If this island, which has left so many families bereft of justice, is to move on we must hold Paul Quinn up as an example that justice can prevail.  In order for this to happen, those in the shadows must be rooted out and take responsibility for their actions.</p>]
