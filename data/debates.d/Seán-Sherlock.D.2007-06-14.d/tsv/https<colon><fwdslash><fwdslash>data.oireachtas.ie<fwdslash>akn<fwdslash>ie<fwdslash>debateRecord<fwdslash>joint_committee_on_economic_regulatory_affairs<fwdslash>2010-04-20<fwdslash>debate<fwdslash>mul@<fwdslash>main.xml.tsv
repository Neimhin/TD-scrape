[<p eid="para_42">I join in welcoming Mr. Delaney to the committee.  I return to the regulatory burden and the €300 million to €400 million estimated cost of regulation to small businesses.  He stated that the process ongoing is positive.  It sounds as if he hopes there will be a positive outcome.  In practical terms I wonder whether, for instance, the taxation burden to small businesses is seen as one of those inputs into reducing the cost burden, and whether, for instance, matters such as health and safety rules and regulations are part of that cost burden, and also the sub-contracting element.</p>, <p eid="para_43">I suppose I am tacking slightly differently on the sub-contracting issue.  One of the issues arising is the inability of sub-contractors to collect on invoices.  It appears that there does not seem to be a set of rules on obligations in that sense and many small businesses have been left high and dry by bigger contractors.  Would a regulatory framework cover that relationship also?  When the small guys, particularly those in the construction industry who sub-contracted for the bigger construction firms were left swinging in the wind when they came to collect their money, they were told in no uncertain terms where to go and where they were in the pecking order.  Is that covered in the regulatory burden as well in terms of rules and regulations that could be put in place?</p>, <p eid="para_44">I mention health and safety as a regulatory burden because the regulatory burden on small businesses, especially in the food industry is particularly onerous.  Under HACCP legislation the HSE is bearing down on them like a ton of bricks in pursuit of small menial type jobs and it places a cost burden on those businesses that one does not see in other countries.  Has that been explored?</p>, <p eid="para_45">I mention the tax burden because two small businesses with which I have dealt, which have met their VAT obligations, for instance, for the 12 month period, because the preliminary payment was underpaid found that they had to pay the interest on that thereafter.  That too is something that needs to be overhauled.  All of these are cost inputs for the business into the future, regardless of what type of business one runs.  We cannot look at the regulatory framework without looking at those cost burdens that businesses must bear.</p>, <p eid="para_46">Perhaps I am tacking slightly away from the substantive issue before us but the small business sector has become a soft target for revenue collection in the absence of being able to collect it from the traditional sources.  I would welcome IBEC's view on it.  The burden has been shifted considerably towards this system.  When I look at small businesses, particularly family-run businesses which are operating today, which have operated intergenerationally, and which have also cut their cloth to measure, I see that the burden being placed on them through increased regulation is stifling them.  Perhaps Mr. Delaney would give a view on that.</p>, <p eid="para_47">On the country that we should emulate, is there a suggestion that the UK is the benchmark by which we should operate?  Is there something from a legislative point of view this committee should take on board which would affect regulation and which would reduce that burden if necessary?</p>]
[<p eid="para_53">I presume the Construction Industry Federation comes under the IBEC umbrella.</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">I presume there are large contractors, construction interests or suppliers to the trade who come under that umbrella.</p>]
[<p eid="para_57">I raise this matter as I am of the view that the late payments legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written.  If one is a small contractor in north Cork, doing work for a major construction company and tries to use that legislation in order to pursue it for payment, it is the case that one will never work in that part of the country again.  In the context of relationships among businesses which are represented by groups such as IBEC and the CIF, surely a voluntary mechanism could be put in place in order to ensure smaller interests would be paid.  That is not happening and such interests are being squeezed out.  When we refer to the lifeblood of the economy, we must remember that small contractors have kept things going on a local level and provided much employment.  I sense that the legislation is not really effective and that the groups which represent the people concerned such as IBEC must come forward with proposals to progress the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_59">I appreciate that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_63">I take Mr. Delaney's point.  People operate their businesses and enter into contracts primarily on the basis of good faith.  That is particularly the case for small contractors entering into arrangements with reputable firms.  For example, if one is going into business with a so-called blue chip construction firm, one can take it on good faith that, based on the law of averages, one should receive payment for one's endeavours.  No one is suggesting representatives of such small businesses should act as if they were above the law.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests that they would better represent the various interests by seeking to put pressure on people they worked for or subcontracted to and there is a sense the small guy is not getting the representation he should.  Mr. Delaney might not accept that but sometimes the small guy cannot put his head above the parapet because if he does, he is gone.</p>]
[<p eid="para_67">Mr. Delaney mentioned 133,000 job losses in the construction industry and 145,000 in the retail sector.  There is a great deal of debate currently about the smart economy and the concept of upskilling but vague language is being used.  How can we get these people back to work, particularly those who worked in the construction industry and who have a skill set because nothing will be built in the near future?  One school of thought is that a massive stock of older houses need upgrading and that process could be incentivised through retrofits and so on.  Is it realistic in IBEC's view that many of these guys can be pooled and put back to work in that sector?  These are dramatic figures.  Not all of the former retail workers will return to the retail sector because that is demand-led and so on.</p>, <p eid="para_68">Reference is repeatedly made to high-end services, upskilling, fourth level education, start-up companies and so on but that will only take up some of the slack.  From a businessman's perspective, where does Mr. Delaney see potential for this country in the future?</p>]
