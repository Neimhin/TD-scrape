SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I sincerely thank the leaders of all the political parties, of all persuasions, for those kind and wonderful words.  I thank too the staff of the House whose expressions of sympathy in the past few weeks have made us proud of the fact that when our father was a Member, he acquitted himself well, was well liked and did his best for the people he represented.Our grief for our father is personal but to be able to share it so publicly in many respects and that so many have expressed sympathy with us leaves us proud.  Our hearts are warmed by the fact that the man endeared himself to so many.I cannot say too much today but with the indulgence of the House will read some lines from a letter I received from a former colleague and dear friend of my father's who campaigned with him over many years:Joe epitomised for me all that is good, fine and noble in politics.  I was so moved to hear you speak so proudly on Thursday [the day of the funeral] about his genuine commitment to the Republicanism of Wolfe Tone and of the French Revolution, of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, because that was what I saw Joe Sherlock live when I had the privilege of working with him.  He was an instinctive socialist, and found ease with the noble of spirit and of heart.  He thought and fought from the heart.  He could readily distinguish between nationalism and republicanism, and always knew a sham when it presented.  His was an abiding humanity, a part of himself that he could not detach or shake off.  His volcanic ability for anger never failed.  He never had to feign it — his honesty valve was set so high!For the very many of us who had the privilege of walking in Joe's considerable shadow, I must say that it was a rare privilege.  It was enriching and exciting.  He gave hope and leadership, and enabled persons to dream, and to believe that there was and is a better way of doing things.  One of the other great ironies is that while Joe was never in government, he achieved more for the people of North Cork as a campaigning politician than a Mercedes full of government ministers ever have — he made a real impact on people's lives.We should not forget Joe, and though his main monument is built in our hearts, we must not leave his inspiration slip.
