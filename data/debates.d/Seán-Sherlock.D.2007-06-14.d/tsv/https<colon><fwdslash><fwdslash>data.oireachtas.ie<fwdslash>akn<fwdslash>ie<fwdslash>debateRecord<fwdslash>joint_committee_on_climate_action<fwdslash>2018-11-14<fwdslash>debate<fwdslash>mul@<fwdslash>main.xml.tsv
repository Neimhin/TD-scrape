[<p eid="para_256">On Wednesdays we flit in and out of committee meetings so I apologise if I repeat anything that was said or asked previously.</p>, <p eid="para_257"> This is all about behavioural change and one of the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations sought the establishment of an independent oversight body. Mr. Watt has used language here today of considering what structures might be necessary. Is there an articulation of that vision across Government about what type of structure could be created or would it continue to be housed in a particular Department looking across other departmental silos? Do we need an overarching structure that would benchmark the actions of individual Departments because I take some solace from the two interventions that we have had here today and the fact that there is a clear outlining of a vision in respect of what needs to be done and the urgency of the problem?</p>, <p eid="para_258"> Frankly, it is the first articulation that I have heard from Departments on the urgency of this. I am trying to deconstruct some of the language that was used. I do not mean this in a pejorative sense but some of the language can be coded such as: "more stringent central mandates" and "least cost abatement options". This language needs to be simplified if we are to produce a report that is fit for purpose and reflects the Citizens' Assembly's report.</p>, <p eid="para_259"> The Citizens' Assembly made a recommendation on the establishment of a central, independent body. Are we moving towards a similar structure across Government that would kick the tyres on what individual Departments are doing?</p>]
[<p eid="para_261">Forgive me.</p>]
[<p eid="para_263">Forgive me if I am not being clear. I am trying to tease out what Mr. Watt is saying about the structures that are necessary. Are they interdepartmental or is there to be an outside independent body?</p>]
[<p eid="para_265">I appreciate that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_267">I am loving this frankness from the Secretary General. Would that all Secretaries General were so frank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_269">How many minutes do I have left?</p>]
[<p eid="para_271">What are Mr. Watt's thoughts on the mechanisms for introducing carbon budgets?</p>]
[<p eid="para_273">We have spoken about reaching targets and we are already surpassing the 5% reduction in emissions there need to be each year between now and 2050. We are just looking for help in producing the best report we can produce in order that the Government might map onto it.</p>]
