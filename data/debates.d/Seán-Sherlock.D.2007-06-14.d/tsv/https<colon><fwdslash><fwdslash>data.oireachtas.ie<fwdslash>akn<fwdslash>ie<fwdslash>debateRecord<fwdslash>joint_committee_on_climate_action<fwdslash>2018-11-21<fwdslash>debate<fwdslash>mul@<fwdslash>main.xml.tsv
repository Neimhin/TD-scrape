[<p eid="para_196">I apologise for missing the first part of the witnesses' engagement with the committee. We have other committees to attend also, but I apologise. I thank the representatives for being here today because it is so important that we have the weight of academic opinion in respect of what needs to be done. It will greatly assist us in trying to form a report that responds to this crisis. I am grateful for the witnesses' attendance today.</p>, <p eid="para_197"> What are the representatives' views on carbon budgets whereby governments or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport are allocated a carbon budget and there is also a universal view on what each Department is emitting through its agencies or activities?</p>]
[<p eid="para_199">So there is a precedent whereby-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_201">That is very useful. If there is some paper that would help this committee, it would be very useful for us to see if there is a translational effect into an Irish context.</p>]
[<p eid="para_203">Does Dr. Aubert believe that it is a good model that should be used? I ask the other witnesses to respond also.</p>]
[<p eid="para_207">This is very interesting because again there is a clear example of a city, perhaps we could call it a city state, with autonomy in respect of its own governance. It is clearly working on this topic. Professor Masson-Delmotte states that there would have to be a clear disaggregation between CO2 and other emissions. For people who may be watching these proceedings, what is the reason for that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_209">I see.</p>]
[<p eid="para_215">Does that mean that policy interventions can be designed once a weighting has been given? Would it be possible to say that this is what we need to do in transport, this is what we need to do in agriculture or buildings and whatever it may be?</p>]
[<p eid="para_217">Yes, that is fine.</p>]
[<p eid="para_219">Is that not the point? We have line Departments reporting to this committee. I do not get a sense of that type of urgency, given the timescales involved, in Ireland moving towards carbon budgeting. Perhaps that is something this committee could include in its recommendations. I am also interested to hear the views of Professor Seneviratne on carbon budgeting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_221">On that, if we establish the principle in the first instance, then we can roll it out. It is important that there are examples in Zurich and France that we can look towards.</p>, <p eid="para_222"> My next question is on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. That is the big beast. In respect of the witnesses' interactions with other governments, academics and entities such as the European Commission, is there a sense that the next CAP will deal with agricultural production in a way that will allow farmers to reshape food chains, to use witnesses' term? Will it also be dealt with in a way that will allow us, in any Irish context, lessen our dependency on intensive farming and move towards policies such as afforestation or horticulture? Do the witnesses have a sense from the early workings on CAP that the European Commission is moving in a particular direction with climate change and agriculture?</p>]
[<p eid="para_224">I thank Dr. Aubert.</p>]
[<p eid="para_228">Is Dr. Aubert hopeful about the schemes being devised by the European Commission? I understand what he is saying about the member statesâ€™ application or implementation of those schemes. I would have thought, however, perhaps naively, that the European Commission is realistic now about the challenges member states are facing in respect of climate change. The European Commission, as an entity in and of itself, notwithstanding any critiques I might have of it on other issues, has no other choice now but to make sure there is a proofing mechanism to ensure there is not, as Dr. Aubert put it, a race to the bottom.</p>]
[<p eid="para_230">I thank Dr. Aubert.</p>]
[<p eid="para_247">I have grappled with carbon capture. Is it ethically sound to use it as a policy intervention?</p>]
[<p eid="para_249">I accept that. I would like the professor's opinion.</p>]
[<p eid="para_254">I do not understand the third point.</p>]
