[<p eid="para_97">I thank the Chairman. I am in Leinster House. I join others in welcoming the Minister to the committee. I will read briefly from the Minister's opening statement:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_98">Careful attention is being paid in drafting to the specific relationship between the coroner and the agency to make sure that investigative obligations which currently lie with the coronial service are not undermined. The position is that nothing in the legislation should preclude further investigation if that is warranted.</p>, <p eid="para_99">The Minister will hear very clearly from members the doubts and worries that are being expressed with regard to the disapplying of the powers of the coroner. We all know that a person of no less standing than Professor Phil Scraton submitted to the committee, which I am sure the Minister heard. When talking about the legislation, Professor Scraton said:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_100">... its enactment would disapply existing powers of the coroner in whatever locations and in respect of all deaths over which a new agency is given jurisdiction. The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinterment ... [or] the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when ... [they] died, where ... [they] died and, most important, how ... [they] died.</p>, <p eid="para_101">I put it to the Minister that he has not adequately addressed thus far the proposal to disapply the power of the coroner. I remain very doubtful about this piece of legislation at present on the basis that witness after expert witness, from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to Professor Scraton, have all expressed their deep concern about the disapplication of that power. I do not care if this is a misuse of that word. I do not believe the Minister has adequately addressed the elephant in the room today. I would love to hear his view on that first point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_104">I do understand this. I apologise for cutting across the Minister but my time is limited. I have noted this and I have internalised what the Minister has said in respect of this point. If he is saying that we cannot have a cross-jurisdictional regime and there has to be consistency in respect of the coronial process, or a system of investigation, I put it to the Minister that the legislation before us still does not robustly instill within it a coronial process akin to the laws of the land and the standards that apply in respect of deaths and the investigative process arising from them. I put it to the Minister that he still has not adequately addressed this issue in the proposal before us today. This is the elephant in the room. I cannot move on with the legislation until we have dealt with this issue sufficiently. The Minister is saying he will consider this element of the legislation to ensure no element could be construed as providing a barrier to any investigation. I am not seeing the evidence of this coming forward in the wording. Forgive me if I have missed this in dispatches.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I ask the Chair to forgive me if I am over time. I do not know how much latitude I have.</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">What makes me uncomfortable is the issue of what the Minister described as "manifestly inappropriate" and the criteria that are to be set down in the first instance by the agency to determine what is or is not manifestly inappropriate. Even if we take exhumation and investigation, is there a fear that the power of the coroner and the coronial process will be undermined? To refer to what Professor Scraton told the committee, 9,000, or 15%, of infants born in the institutions examined died there, in addition to the deaths of 200 mothers. We know the rates of mortality are extremely high and I would have thought this alone would be sufficient to ensure there is no ambiguity on the issue of the discretion of the Government of the day to put in place, or set up, an agency as it sees fit. If the number of deaths is so high, and if we know from the commission's reports that the mortality rate in institutions was extremely high, this in and of itself surely is worthy of investigation, such that a Minister cannot limit the power to investigate it if the Government of the day decided for economic reasons not to go there and not to open that casket because it could be at it for years and investigations could cost the State millions of euro.</p>, <p eid="para_110"> If we go down the road in the Bill of being influenced by economic factors and not factors of transitional justice, such as the convention on enforced disappearances, the obligations of investigation and the rights to remedy, then we will come back to this down the line. I am on the side of the Minister but I want to be reassured by what he is telling us about the legislation being robust enough to ensure justice will not be denied in future to people or relatives and to those poor souls who have the right to justice. Forgive me as I do not mean to be rhetorical about this but I want to be sure we get it absolutely right.</p>]
[<p eid="para_137">Forgive me if I repeat some points that have already been made. If we accept the fact that the powers of the coroner are being disapplied on two out of three sets of criteria, which is what the Minister is saying, but that the power of investigation is not diminished in any way because that is the law of the land, the legitimate question arises about the number of agencies involved. Referring to Tuam specifically - and thank goodness for the work of Catherine Corless and others - we reasonably know where we stand and what is ahead of us in the road ahead as this application applies. If I refresh my memory, we had a presentation from the historical burials legislation unit - the Minister's own colleagues - where they said that the legislation was being applied because existing jurisdiction to authorise exhumations does not readily apply to the particularly unusual circumstances arising at Tuam, and similarly the legislation governing the identification of remains by means of DNA comparison is not suitable for those circumstances. We know why we are legislating.</p>, <p eid="para_138"> I have a final request for the Minister. If we accept that the power of the coroner is not diminished in any way will the Minister give this committee some comfort that resources will be made available for the recruitment of an additional number of coroners, or give us an assurance that the coronial process as it applies to the creation of an agency in respect of a specific site or other follow-on sites will not be hampered by the lack of adequate coronial services, such as for the efforts in seeking justice and the efforts in seeking to identify remains, and that these services are not undermined by a lack of resources? That is my question, fundamentally.</p>, <p eid="para_139"> I have a second point for the Minister. There is one limited power that individual Members of the Oireachtas have, which is the power to submit the parliamentary question. I hope that something would be built into this legislation on the accountability feature that allows for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas, to make representations on behalf of a person or families who may wish to seek information. I hope that the making of those representations or the advocating for families, which is what we all do as Members, would not be diminished in any way and that some structure could be put in place so Members could assist such persons, and that GDPR and other barriers would not be put up in front of us.</p>]
[<p eid="para_141">Again, I just want to be very clear. I ask the Minister to forgive me, and I know he is not deliberately misinterpreting what I am saying. I am talking about the resourcing of the coronial service, and that is a matter for the Government. I recognise that silos exist in Departments, but the Minister is the line manager, as it were, for the setting up of this agency. Therefore, if there is to be an extensive coronial investigative process in this regard, I ask that it will not be hampered. That is presumably a whole-of-Government matter and not just for the Minister for Justice. Therefore, I take the point the Minister is making about the review, but I ask him to use his good offices to ensure that when an agency is created that it will not be hampered by the lack of investigative powers due to the unavailability of a coroner or coroners or other such appropriate staff as might be deemed necessary to carry out investigations.</p>]
[<p eid="para_144">Again, I am not asking for the disapplication of the-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_146">I am sorry, I apologise.</p>]
[<p eid="para_149">That is fine, but I want to be clear that I am not asking for the disapplication of GDPR.</p>]
[<p eid="para_151">GDPR is sometimes put up as a block to Teachta√≠ in respect of certain agencies which are subsets of Departments. It is sometimes misapplied, and I do not want that to happen in this case. The Minister is again telling us that the coronial process is being disapplied in two out of three criteria, if I understood him correctly. I may be mishearing the Minister, but he appears now to be saying that the coronial process is being completely disapplied. My hearing could be at fault or I might be misinterpreting the Minister. If I am, I will stand corrected. However, there needs to be clarity in this regard, because I am a little more confused after the Minister's last intervention than I was before. I ask the Minister to forgive me if I am wrong.</p>]
