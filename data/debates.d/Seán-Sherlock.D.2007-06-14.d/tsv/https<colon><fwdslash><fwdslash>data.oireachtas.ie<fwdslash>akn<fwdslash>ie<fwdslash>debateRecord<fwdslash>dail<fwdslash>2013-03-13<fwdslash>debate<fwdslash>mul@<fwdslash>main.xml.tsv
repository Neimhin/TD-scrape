[<p eid="para_816">I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. I thank Deputy Charles Flanagan for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the issues raised.</p>, <p eid="para_817"> The Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013-14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected, with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.</p>, <p eid="para_818"> How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities presents a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities, including minorities, in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.</p>, <p eid="para_819">The value for money review of small primary school provision is at an advanced stage of preparation. The Department expects to publish the review, at which stage its findings can be debated.</p>, <p eid="para_820"> At post-primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are 55 schools, out of 723 post-primary schools, charging fees, ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils. The State pays the salary of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools, compared with the salary of one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher applies in DEIS schools. The pupil-teacher ratio will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools, carried out by the Department of Education and Skills and published on Tuesday, 5 March, shows that fee-charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.</p>, <p eid="para_821"> There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community about the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. The Government recognises the importance of ensuring students from a Protestant or Reformed Church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos, while, at the same time, ensuring funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Minister has welcomed the recent announcement by Kilkenny College that it is entering the free secondary school scheme and will cease to charge fees from September next. It is a welcome development that the school considers that its future can best be secured through the free scheme and that it can continue to deliver a Church of Ireland school ethos for families in the south-east in this way.</p>, <p eid="para_822"> In regard to capitation, the Department provides capitation funding for all recognised primary schools and second level schools within the free education scheme. There has been some reduction in the level of capitation funding in recent years owing to the need to operate within our tight budgetary requirements. </p>, <p eid="para_823"> With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, there is an arrangement whereby funding is provided by my Department for the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty in meeting the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a Reformed Church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually and this fund ensures necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p>, <p eid="para_824"> Regarding school transport provision, a number of changes have been implemented in the primary and post-primary school transport scheme. These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis.</p>, <p eid="para_825"> I confirm that the Minister and his relevant departmental officials will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland and boards of education, on education provision for all areas.</p>]
[<p eid="para_828">On the first question, I can facilitate the Deputy in ensuring he receives guidance on the guidelines on and processes involved in amalgamations. On the second question, the Constitution does not allow for either positive or negative discrimination in schools based on their religious ethos.</p>]
[<p eid="para_830">I take the Deputy's point on the position in certain areas of the country where there is a one-teacher school and, owing to geographical or other considerations, pupils may not be able to avail of the nearest school with their ethos. This is an issue with which we have to grapple. I know from my experience in my constituency where the Department has had consultations with the local bishop that there are ongoing discussions on how we can sort out these issues. In that sense, there is an open door. On the point on one-teacher schools, I would be of the mindset that we need to take these examples and grapple with them example by example. I would certainly have an open mind in facilitating that process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1254">There is nothing worse than being patronised.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1256">This is particularly so since I have served in this House since 2007, longer than the Deputy yonder. I know I have earned my place here. Over the past two nights, there is no doubt that we have had an interesting and passionate debate and valid points have been made by both sides. Sometimes it turns a little bit raucous and many interventions have been quite rhetorical. In response to some points made by parties across the benches, if we are talking about the restoration of this economy and society, one must take cognisance of the fact that for the past decade or so, investment was primarily in construction, which fuelled the economy across many sectors. When that sector collapsed spectacularly along with the creation of the credit crisis, this Government when it came into power had to set out a new foundation and start investing in new areas so that one can upskill and retrain the very workers who have lost their jobs and now have to emigrate and about whom Sinn Féin is talking. One must put in place a set of new ideas that will begin new investments in a myriad of new sectors across the economy.</p>, <p eid="para_1257"> If we are to have a motion in this House about labour market activation, I would rather the parties opposite interrogated Springboard, Momentum, the ICT skills conversion courses, the redundant apprentice placement scheme and schemes of that nature. If there is a critique of those schemes, I would like to hear it. One either agrees that the schemes are necessary or one does not. If we do not have schemes of that nature, we will not provide opportunities for those people, mainly young men who relied on the construction sector, to get back into work.</p>, <p eid="para_1258"> In the two years that this Government has been in existence, we have put a myriad of schemes in place of which there has been a large take up. They have been quite successful, particularly JobBridge where a number of people have secured full-time jobs. I agree with some of the points made by Members opposite in respect of certain areas of Ireland where we have not had the foreign direct investment that is so necessary to sustain those areas. It is a pity I have only one minute left because I am only getting started.</p>, <p eid="para_1259"> I have offered Sinn Féin a chance to sit down with me and interrogate each of our policies, many of which I cannot articulate because of the limited time I have on this motion, and I think it will take me up on this offer. I have offered it a chance to go through and critique each one of those schemes as long as it is an objective critique and not rhetorical and empty so that we can work with parties opposite regardless of their hue to get us out of this crisis. Sinn Féin may score points but that is its prerogative as an Opposition party. This is the boxing ring and that is the job of Opposition but if it is going to interrogate the Government, it should not use empty rhetoric and at least come to us with something specific that critiques the policies we are putting forward. It must acknowledge that there has been real growth in the economy, that there has been an net increase in jobs, that we are continuing to win the type of investments that are necessary across a myriad of sectors and that we are investing in these sectors.</p>, <p eid="para_1260"> I attended an InterTradeIreland event last week. It is a North-South body created as a result of North-South relations. I met with a representative from Sinn Féin at that conference. There is an acknowledgement that if this island is to flourish, it must be on the basis of building cross-Border and bilateral links with our neighbours. The more we can embed that within the system and the more opportunities we can create through agencies like InterTradeIreland, the more we will raise the economic ship of this island. I apologise for the fact that I do not have enough time to respond to all the points raised.</p>]
