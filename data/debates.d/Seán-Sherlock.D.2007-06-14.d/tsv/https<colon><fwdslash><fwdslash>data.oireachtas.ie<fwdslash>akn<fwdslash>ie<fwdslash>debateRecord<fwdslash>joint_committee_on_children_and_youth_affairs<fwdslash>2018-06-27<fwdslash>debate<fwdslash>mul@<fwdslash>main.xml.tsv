SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:20:00+01:00	I would like to join in welcoming all the witnesses here before the committee today. Their submissions are very interesting, and there are some very pragmatic and practical recommendations therein. They are based on common sense but very often common sense is not applied when one is trying to conduct a public policy and a set of outcomes that have a beneficial effect for the general population. We all have an instinctive view on what needs to happen, but then how is that translated into practical policies and actions? That is what we are trying to get to the nub of here in this committee. We are trying to come up with a report that has very practical suggestions. The witnesses' recommendations are very beneficial to that process. Before I question anybody, I want to congratulate Mr. John Treacy on his appointment as chairman of the board of Concern. It is a very welcome appointment, which I think we would all wholeheartedly welcome. On the Children's Sport Participation and Physical Activity Study of 2010, the witness has openly acknowledged in his submission that it now needs to be updated and made fit for purpose for 2018, 2019 and onwards. Could I ask if the effects of the use of technology are mapped onto that study in any way? Has the use and preponderance of technology in homes and society been examined? The reason I ask is we are hearing that technology has a massively negative impact on very basic activity levels in children, and other people who have submitted to this process here have said that. Is that part of the study?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:20:00+01:00	Who owns that study? Is Sport Ireland just a participant?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:20:00+01:00	Where is the academic research being carried out?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:20:00+01:00	That is fine. I think it would be useful for us-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:20:00+01:00	I appreciate that. Two hours of screen time seems almost nostalgic by today's standards, which is ironic. If they are to report in November, which is only a few months away, and if that is not included in the study, it would be very useful for us to know, perhaps through Sport Ireland or one of the other stakeholders, whether the use of technology is being mapped onto those types of longitudinal studies. It would be useful to us and our work here. When we speak about obesity in Ireland, we speak about targeting lower socio-economic groups. I often wonder how that happens in real terms. Can Mr. Treacy give a practical example of a local sports partnership, of the 29 on the €6 million budget line, where there is a clear targeting of a lower socio-economic group?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	I appreciate that. If some clear examples of those projects could be outlined to the committee, it would help us in drafting our report. Perhaps Dr. May could outline in that submission how this could be replicated across a number of different areas. We need practical examples like that to help us in our work. I am grateful for that. safefood is a North-South body. What is the budget of the Start programme?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	It is less than €1 million.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	I do not quite understand the expression Dr. Foley-Nolan used at the outset to the effect that we almost see the situation as "inevitable and insoluble". I cannot think like that, and we cannot think like that as a committee. I have to be optimistic about what we can achieve and keep driving on and pursuing this issue. I do not see it as being necessarily inevitable and insoluble. Can Dr. McGloin give us a high-level view of how the START programme works? It may not be possible today. There is a €900,000 budget line. It is across the island of Ireland. Is safefood trying to reach into schools or into houses? I note the recommendations of improvements in co-ordination between community and hospital-based health professionals, the 70:30 ratio for healthy eating and physical activity and more community cooking programmes such as Cook It. How is safefood translated across those initiatives? That is what I am trying to understand.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	A parent is a parent. I am working on the assumption that most parents have common sense. I am not talking about educational attainment, what socio-economic group they are in or anything like that. Is Dr. McGloin saying to me that Irish parents are expressing concerns about what constitutes proper screen time? Are we at that level of-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	Change is needed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-27T10:30:00+01:00	Could Dr. McGloin send us a note on that? That is practical and would be helpful.
