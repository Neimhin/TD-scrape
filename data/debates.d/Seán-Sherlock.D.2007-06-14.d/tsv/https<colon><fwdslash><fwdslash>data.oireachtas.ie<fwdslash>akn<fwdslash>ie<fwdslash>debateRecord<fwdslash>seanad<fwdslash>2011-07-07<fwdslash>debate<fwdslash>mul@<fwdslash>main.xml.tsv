[<p eid="para_854">I thank the Senator for his gracious and kind comments which are greatly appreciated.  He might drop me a note on the issues he has raised because we should engage on what is a genuine undertaking on his part.</p>, <p eid="para_855">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p>, <p eid="para_856">I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the provision of new post-primary schools to cater for demographic increases.  The Department's most recent statistics indicate that the number of pupils at second level is projected to increase by 24,900 from the current level of circa 317,400 pupils to 342,300 by 2017.  The projections indicate that pupil numbers will continue to rise until 2024, when it is expected there will be in the region of 383,000 pupils in the second-level system.  That represents an increase of 65,700 pupils over the current levels.</p>, <p eid="para_857">The Department is utilising a geographical information system, GIS, to identify the areas in which there will be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This detailed analysis is now being finalised and action plans are being drawn up for each priority location in order to determine how to meet the additional school accommodation requirements for each area for the next four to five years.</p>, <p eid="para_858">It is within this context that the Minister recently announced that up to 40 new schools are to be established within the next six years, comprising 20 new primary and 20 new post-primary schools.  Of the 40 new schools, 17 will be in the Dublin area, with a further 12 in the commuter belt of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Louth.  Six new schools will be established in Cork, three in Galway and one each in Wexford and Cavan.  Included in this announcement are new post-primary schools for Navan, Drogheda and Ashbourne, which will greatly enhance second-level provision in the wider area referred to by the Deputy.  In addition, the Department recognised a new post-primary school for east Meath, located in Laytown, in 2008-09.  The school is currently located in temporary accommodation beside the site on which the permanent new school is under construction.  The new permanent school building, which will provide accommodation for 1,000 pupils, is expected to be ready in July 2012.  This school caters for children from the east Meath areas of Laytown, Bettystown, Stamullen and Julianstown.  I thank the Senator again for raising this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_864">I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  As the Senator has raised the issue of the job losses at GlaxoSmithKline, it is important for us to join with him in acknowledging the addition to the numbers unemployed in Dungarvan.  I acknowledge what the Senator is saying in that regard and I join with him, although I do not want to give just platitudes, in extending our sympathy to those families.  I have listened to his comments about the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I must note for the record that the Senator's Oireachtas colleague Deputy Ciara Conway also contacted me today about the GlaxoSmithKline announcement.  I was told that while the headcount reduction is regrettable — there is no question about that — the company's aim is to remain focused on the long-term future of the site, ensuring that it remains competitive.  Although the site remains strategic within the company's network, the company must continue to control its cost base and be more flexible because of global trends.  That is the line coming from the company on this.</p>, <p eid="para_865">It is easy for us as Ministers to stand here and say this is down to a global phenomenon, but a foreign direct investment company is particularly subject to retrenchment in terms of its cost base, especially if it is competing against other aspects of its own structure, and it is appropriate for it to reduce its costs.  The unfortunate thing about that is the resulting job losses.  If it does have a programme of retrenchment, the important thing is that the company makes itself sustainable so it can preserve the remaining jobs.  We must try our best to work with the State agencies in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_866">I have noted the report referred to by the Senator, which was produced in 2008, a time when the country as a whole was facing immense challenges.  We all know that job creation is central to our economic recovery and it will be clear from the programme for Government that job creation is at the core of the Government's policies.  The role of my Department is to ensure we have the right policies in place to support and enlarge our enterprise base in order to facilitate job creation and job retention.</p>, <p eid="para_867">The jobs initiative announced on 10 May focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation.  The initiative represents a positive intervention to support those entrepreneurs and business people who will create jobs and rebuild our economy.  The key elements were the retention of the 12.5% corporation tax and the introduction of a new, temporary, second reduced rate of VAT to apply primarily to restaurants and catering services, hotel and holiday accommodation and various entertainment services.  I hope these reductions were adhered to in Waterford especially in recent weeks with the visit of the tall ships and I hope that the hospitality sector there has done well out of it.  Our hope is that this will continue.  Other elements include the halving of the lower rate of employers PRSI on earnings of up to €356 per week; the focus of the State's capital expenditure towards more employment-intensive projects in the areas of education, local and regional roads and sustainable transport projects; and the provision of an extra 20,900 activation places for the unemployed.  The jobs initiative is an important first step in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_868">One announcement for the south-east region this year will create 50 new jobs in Waterford.  Also, jobs announced for the region in recent years continue to come on-stream.  As well as marketing the region for new green-field investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients to broaden their mandate in Ireland and also with existing clients to re-invest in sites in the region.  While we are operating in difficult economic times, there are still investment opportunities in global markets.  There are 31 IDA Ireland-supported companies in Waterford city and county employing approximately 5,300 people.  Clear evidence of a transition towards more knowledge-based and higher value activity is apparent in the resilience of companies such as Bausch &amp; Lomb, Honeywell, Citi Hedge Funds, Genzyme and Sun Life Financial.</p>, <p eid="para_869">I will be visiting Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, because I have heard about the great work under way there in the life sciences, information and communications technology, international services and high technology engineering areas.  WIT is one place earmarked for a visit by me as the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  It is important to spin out as many companies as we can, locally if possible, from such institutes as WIT.</p>]
