SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-09-26T16:10:00+01:00	I stand before the House as somebody who was formerly a representative on Mallow Town Council and I was proud to be a member. I cut my back teeth on that very council.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-09-26T16:10:00+01:00	When I was a Minister of State and somebody asked me before an Irish Presidency Competitiveness Council meeting whether I was nervous going into such a big room with all those European Union Ministers from the 27 members states, I had to say that if a person had ever chaired a meeting of Mallow Town Council then he or she could chair a meeting of any forum anywhere in the world. I am proud of the fact that I started there, as did my late father in 1967. In government, we become part of a collective agreement and I was part of the decision that collectively agreed to abolish town councils. I am glad that we as a party have taken a decision to seek to rescind that decision. It was a grievous error and I acknowledge fully that I was part of that decision. I support the legislation that we have put forward so that we can create again the front-line for representative democracy, that is, through our municipal or district councils. People will argue that local authorities such as Cork County Council have the municipal districts. In my experience, since their creation, people have been a little removed from the decision-making mechanisms. The resources of the local authorities have become more stretched in the allocation of engineers, housing staff and outdoor staff and they are covering a larger geographic area. If we decide to implement this legislation as a Legislature and reinstate town councils, what we will put back into them is the core competency of staff who always looked after these towns. Since the abolition of town councils, I have noticed a diminution of services in towns. I am sure many Members find themselves doing council-related work more often. We are all happy to do that because all politics is local and we will help everybody at every turn of the road, no matter how high up the food chain we go politically. I believe though that having a coterie of town councillors again representing districts and towns would be another service. It would mean a return to basics and to core principles in representative democracy and the people would welcome that. No matter what town a person comes from, when he or she walks down the main street as a public representative - whether as a councillor, a Deputy or a Minister - there will always be somebody on a Friday or Saturday afternoon that will ask why we abolished the town councils. I am hard-pressed to give an answer. This legislation seeks to address that. People liked the idea that they had a local person they could go to who would represent their interests and advocate for the bread and butter issues that affect them. I refer to getting the bread and butter issues or the simple things right because sometimes it is the simple things that exercise people. The town council gave everybody access on those bread and butter issues. There is now a sense of remoteness. Citizens in towns do not feel that connectedness through the relationships in the municipal districts. That is something that this legislation would address.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-09-26T21:30:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 16:In page 17, line 5, to delete "or" where it secondly occurs.I am one of a number of Deputies who have put this forward. I make no bones about saying I am from the constituency of Cork East and Irish Distillers has a big operation there through the Midleton Distillery and big Irish brands are present, including Jameson. I have a little concern and I hope the Minister can allay those issues with signage. The whiskey tourism offering is quite strong currently. There are up to 130,000 visitors coming to Midleton annually and they include tourists and other responsible persons who purchase products. There is a massive multiplier effect for the local economy as they spend time in the Cork and south-west region. Forgive me if I am misinterpreting the legislation but I worry that if we are to put in place measures that would prevent signage to distilleries such as that in Midleton, it would serve as an impediment to those visitors. Irish Distillers is a big employer, employing 600 people across four sites. As I said, whiskey tourism is a growing offering as part of the greater tourism spend. I add my voice to the concerns about signage, particularly with respect to visitor centres, which is a key element of the argument. While I have the floor, I should indicate that I put down an amendment that was withdrawn on Committee Stage relating to cancer labelling. The amendment came about not because I am against labelling per se but rather because I had reservations about cancer labelling on its own.I wanted to look at the labelling issue in the round because if one thinks of diabetes, cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease, depression, seizures and gout, it is obvious that abuse of alcohol has an impact in the context of a range of illnesses. It was for this reason that I tabled the amendment. I hope, however, if we are to take an approach to labelling, that we would look at all of the illnesses and all of the diseases in the round and that we would not be so prescriptive in the context of cancer. That is merely my worry. I am not against labelling per se. If the Minister could provide an answer in that regard at some stage I would be grateful. I do not wish to delay the passage of this legislation any further.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-09-26T22:00:00+01:00	I am very happy with the Minister's explanation and justification. There are a number of names on the amendment before the House. I am happy to withdraw my name from it, or at least not to press the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-09-26T22:00:00+01:00	I wish to clarify that I am withdrawing my own name from it. I am satisfied with the explanation the Minister has given me.
