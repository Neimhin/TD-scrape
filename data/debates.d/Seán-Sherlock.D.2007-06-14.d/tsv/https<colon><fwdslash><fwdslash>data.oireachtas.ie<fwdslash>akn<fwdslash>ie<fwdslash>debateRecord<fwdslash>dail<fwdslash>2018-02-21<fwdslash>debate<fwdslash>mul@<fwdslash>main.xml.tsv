SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:00:00+00:00	Indeed.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:00:00+00:00	When will we move to the next item of business?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:00:00+00:00	I thank the Acting Chairman. I do not plan to take that much time. I welcome the funding of approximately â‚¬900 million for the M20 Cork to Limerick route. All affected, including the chambers of commerce in Cork and Limerick, which did much work on this issue in terms of making submissions, various community groups, businesses and individuals who travel the route every day for work and other purposes are very welcoming of there finally being a financial commitment to the project. I travelled from my home town of Mallow to Galway yesterday and then on to Dublin. It is quite difficult to travel between Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville and there are serious traffic constraints. Once one reaches Limerick, however, it is a joy to travel on to Galway, while, similarly, if one is travelling east towards Dublin, it is a seamless journey for anyone partaking of it. When selecting the route for the M20 between Cork and Limerick, I ask that the Government take account of the serious blockages at Mallow, Buttevant and Charleville. Those towns deserve to be freed of such congestion and running the route somewhere adjacent to them would be the most advisable and sensible option. The town of Cobh, known locally as the great island of Cobh, which has only one access route, is not mentioned in the plan. There was some discussion late last year in this Chamber about the need to ensure that Cobh is serviced by proper infrastructure. It is disappointing that there is no mention of the town in the significant list of inter-urban routes, which includes towns and cities such as Gorey, Cork and Limerick. The people of Cobh deserve an adequate access point to their town. Storm Ophelia demonstrated the need for such a route. I hope that, in the context of the iterative process under way in regard to the national development plan, the Minister of State, Deputy English, who is present, could mention that need because it is inadvisable for Cobh to be left out of the plan, given that it has an approximate population of 13,000 and that in the event of a natural phenomenon such as Storm Ophelia, there is no guarantee of proper access for emergency vehicles to the town, which does not have secondary or tertiary medical facilities and is all but closed off from time to time. I ask that consideration be given to this issue. There must be absolute transparency in terms of the process currently under way in respect of the Cork events centre. This has been the subject of much debate in the context of requests for further funding in circumstances where taxpayers' money is involved and it appears that the representatives for the county and city of Cork have been left out of the loop regarding information flows on what is happening on the project. A request for additional funding was made but the people of Cork demand to know its purpose. People were foursquare behind the project when it was announced by the previous Government but somewhere along the way the goalposts were shifted, a request for additional funding came in and nobody is any the wiser as to how that money will be spent locally. I am disappointed that the plan does not seem to address the additionality of capital services or spending for mental health services. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, a member of the Independent Alliance, has waxed lyrical about the increases in current expenditure but Members on the front line who represent people who need access to services and a continuum of care from childhood to adulthood and into their senior years do not see evidence in the plan of moneys becoming available for capital expenditure on necessary mental health services, such as housing and other ancillary services. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to be cognisant of that and to raise it as an issue. There is wording in the plan in that regard-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:00:00+00:00	I acknowledge that but I ask that there be a greater interrogation of what it means for those who need access to mental health services. I am very conscious that there three Members are due to contribute in this slot and that we only have a finite amount of time. In that context, those are the three main issues I wish to address. My final point relates to my home town, Mallow. I am glad that the Mallow relief road which I, when I was a Minister of State, ensured was included in the 2015 plan is also included in this plan. However, no funding amount has been allocated in respect of the project.We need to see the colour of the Government's money on the northern relief road for Mallow.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:30:00+00:00	I have ten minutes but a wise person once said to me there is no need to take the full ten minutes if it only takes one minute to say what needs to be said. We are supporting the Bill. We wish to make the point that applying a maximum age of 60 seems anachronistic. There are people who are contributing to society far beyond those years, into their 70s and 80s. The Minister might give us some justification for the age of 60. We are supporting the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:40:00+00:00	Sorry, I want an apology. I did not show the Deputy a lack of respect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:40:00+00:00	I did not show the Deputy any lack of respect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-21T16:40:00+00:00	Deputy Fitzpatrick just accused us of disrespect.
