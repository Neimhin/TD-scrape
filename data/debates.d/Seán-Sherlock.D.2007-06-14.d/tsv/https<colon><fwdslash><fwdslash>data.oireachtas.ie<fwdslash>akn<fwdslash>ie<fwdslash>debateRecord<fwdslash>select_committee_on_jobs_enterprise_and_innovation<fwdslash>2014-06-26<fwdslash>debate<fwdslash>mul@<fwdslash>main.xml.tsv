SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-06-26T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, lines 20 and 21, to delete "Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation" and substitute "Minister".This a technical amendment, as the full title of the Minister is to be included in the definitions in section 2 and addressed in amendment No. 3.  Amendment No. 2 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 3 which inserts a definition for the word "Minister".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 2:In page 5, line 27, to delete "2006." and substitute "2006;".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, after line 27, to insert the following:" "Minister" means the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:
“Amendment of section 2 of Act of 2003
3. Section 2 of the Act of 2003 is amended—(a) in subsection (1A), by inserting the following paragraph after paragraph (a):“(aa) the foreign national being employed outside the State by a foreign employer and being required by the foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, a person in the State who is connected to the foreign employer,”,(b) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (2B):“(2C) A person shall not permit a foreign national who is employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, that person where that person is connected to the foreign employer, except in accordance with an employment permit granted by the Minister under section 8 of the Employment Permits Act 2006 that is in force.”,(c) in subsection (3)—(i) by substituting “, (2) or (2C)” for “or (2)”, and(ii) in paragraph (b), by substituting “(2) or (2C)” for “(2)”,(d) by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3):“(3A) It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under subsection (3) consisting of a contravention of subsection (1) to show that he or she took all such steps as were reasonably open to him or her to ensure compliance with subsection (1).”,(e) in subsection (4), by substituting “subsection (2) or (2C)” for “subsection (2)”, (f) by inserting the following subsections after subsection (10A):“(10B) Without prejudice to any other provision of this Act, this section does not apply to—(a) a foreign national who is in the State pursuant to the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967, and(b) the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has certified in writing that the foreign national referred to in paragraph (a) falls within a reciprocal arrangement that permits a foreign national who is a member of the family of an assigned person, forming part of his or her household, to be in employment in the State.(10C) A foreign national referred to in subsection (10B) shall be entitled to be in employment in the State without an employment permit for the duration of the assignment to official duties in the State of the assigned person concerned.(10D) In subsections (10B) and (10C)— ‘assigned person’ means a person who is assigned, by a government of another state, to carry out official duty in the State on behalf of the government of that other state; ‘reciprocal arrangement’ means an arrangement (whether in the form of a memorandum of understanding or otherwise) that is entered into by the Government with another state.”,and(g) by substituting the following subsection for subsection (15):“(15) In this section—‘connected’ has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2006;‘foreign employer’ has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2006;‘place’ includes any dwelling or any building or part of a building.”.”.The amendment amends section 2(1A) of the 2003 Act by inserting a new paragraph (aa) and ensures the transfer of a foreign national in an intra-company transfer is clearly included in the general requirement to have an employment permit.  The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfers.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder’s employer is outside the State, that is, a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is, the Irish entity.  It is the Minister's intention that the provisions of the Bill relating to intra-company transfer employment permits respect the employer-employee contractual relationship between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference to the connected person that could suggest it was the employer has been removed and sections have been redrafted accordingly.  Many of the Committee Stage amendments are drafted to achieve this aim.The new subsection (b) provides that a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person shall not be permitted to do so except in accordance with an intra-company transfer employment permit and that to do otherwise is an offence. The new subsection (c) applies the offence provisions where a foreign national employed outside the State by a foreign employer to carry out duties for, or participate in, a training programme provided by the connected person does not have the required intra-company transfer employment permit. The new subsection (d) will provide a defence to a foreign national working without an employment permit who can prove he or she took all reasonable steps to ensure compliance with section 2. This defence is already provided in the 2003 Act to an employer who employs someone without an employment permit. This provision addresses an issue raised by Mr. Justice Hogan in his 2012 ruling in the Younis case, which he referred to the Oireachtas and the Minister. Acceptance of amendment No. 4 will involve the deletion of section 3 of the published Bill. The new subparagraph (e) in section 3 of the Bill applies the defence provisions of section 2(4) of the 2003 Act to the new subsection 2C. Subsection 2C makes it an explicit requirement that a foreign national employed by a foreign employer who undertakes duties for, or training with, a connected person in the State has a valid employment permit. The effect of this is to provide a defence for those charged with an offence consisting of a contravention of the new subsection 2C. The new subparagraph (f) in subsection 3 of the Bill is required to address the variance which exists between existing employment permits legislation and the State's obligations under international agreements concerning the employment of dependants of State employees assigned on official duty overseas, often referred to as working spouse or working dependant agreements, particularly the treaty agreement in place between Ireland and the US. The amendment provides an exemption from the terms of the proposed Act for foreign nationals in the State under the terms of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 who are assigned to a mission in a country with which the Government has entered into a working dependant agreement. Under the terms of the working dependant agreement with the US and Canada, both of which predate the employment permits legislation, relevant dependants of officials assigned abroad are entitled to an authorisation to work in the other country. This system has been applied in full to Irish dependants overseas, but following the introduction of the Employment Permits Acts, applications by relevant embassies based here must be accompanied by a formal job offer, in contradiction of the terms of these international agreements. While our partners in the US and Canada implement the terms of working dependant agreements in full, our legislation as it stands means Ireland cannot fulfil its obligations to our partners. The US has noted on several occasions that Ireland's insistence on receipt of a formal job offer before issuing the employment permit is in breach of the agreement being implemented in full by the US. It is not expected that the amendment will lead to a substantial increase in non-Irish nationals seeking work under the terms of working dependant agreements. In addition, the exemption ends upon completion of the posting of the assigned person, usually a four-year duration. The new subsection (g) in section 3 of the Bill assigns the definitions of new terms used in the legislation, which fall out of the treatment of the intra-company transfer situation in the Bill. I am considering further minor amendments to section 3 of the Bill and will revert on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:10:00+01:00	In essence, in language which is legislative with regard to speaking on the record, the nub of the issue is that multinational companies have welcomed the clarity we will provide on issuing permits.  Notwithstanding the language used, it provides greater clarity for workers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:10:00+01:00	We have engaged with stakeholders on it and through this engagement it is necessary to use legislative language, but I assure the Deputy it does provide clarity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 5:In page 6, line 11, to delete "following section" and substitute "following sections".Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment and consequential to the insertion of two sections in the 2003 Act, section 2B in the published Bill and section 2C under amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 6 is a drafting amendment to the new section 2B inserted into the 2003 Act by section 4 of the Bill and ensures consistency with use of the term "service" in these provisions.  With regard to amendment No. 7, I have followed the Younis case closely and we all agree it was shocking.  We were shocked at the exploitation and injustice it highlighted.  The objective of the new section 2B is to further deter employers from employing foreign nationals without an employment permit by permitting the foreign national and the Minister to take civil action for compensation against the employer, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract.  This is in addition to potential criminal prosecution of the employer.  Deputy Tóibín's amendment deals specifically with this.  Without necessarily speaking too much on the amendment until the Deputy proposes it, it would raise the bar in terms of what a foreign national or the Minister, in deciding whether to take a case on behalf of a foreign national under the new provision, has to prove before a court to get paid compensation.  I will leave it at that until Deputy Tóibín speaks on his amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 6:In page 6, line 26, after "employment" where it firstly occurs to insert "or service".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:20:00+01:00	I propose to deal with the amendments numerically.  Deputy Tóibín’s amendment would place the onus on the foreign national of proving that exploitative work practices took place.  Currently, the foreign national does not have to prove that this occurred in order to avail of the provision.  Unscrupulous employers who employ illegal non-EEA nationals continue to face the possibility of prosecution under the employment permits legislation.  If found guilty of an offence, such employers face a fine of up to €250,000, imprisonment for a term of up to ten years or both.  An Garda Síochána and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, actively pursue breaches under the legislation and welcome information concerning possible breaches.  On this basis, we will not accept amendment No. 7.  Regarding amendment No. 8, the new civil proceedings provide for compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract of employment – this point is important - and the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rate for the job.  These are rates provided for in law and there is no ambiguity or complex standards of proof for a court in determining how much the compensation should be.  It is also how the Labour Court determined Mr. Younis's compensation.  The Deputy’s amendment would add complexity and ambiguity to a court's determination of what the rate for a "regularised employee engaging in the same employment" would be and could actually result in the applicant's claim failing if such a rate could not be established to the court's satisfaction.  On the other hand, the national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  It would be different if the contract of employment were legal, but in such a scenario it is not.  We will not accept the amendment.  Amendment No. 9 provides for retrospective effect of the provision so that a person taking proceedings pursuant to the new section 2B of the 2003 Act can claim an amount of money for work done or services rendered during a period prior to, as well as after, the commencement of the section.  The new section is providing a remedy to a defined class of persons who have not been properly recompensed for work done or services rendered by reason of the illegality of their contracts of employment.  It covers those who never had permits and those whose permits lapsed through no fault of their own.  The employer has benefitted from the work done or services rendered.  If the employee had held an employment permit, the employer would have had to pay him or her at least the national minimum wage.  As a matter of social justice, the Minister wishes to provide a remedy to the class of persons referred to in section 2B.  New subsections (6) to (9), inclusive, inserted into section 2B, impose limitations on the right of action conferred by section 2B and are proposed, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, for the purpose of making the section more likely to withstand challenge whether on constitutional or European Convention on Human Rights grounds.  The new subsection (10) inserted into section 2B provides that, where the Minister institutes proceedings under section 2B, the court may award costs in favour of the Minister.  We are considering some further amendments to these provisions and I will revert on this matter on Report Stage.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, are drafting amendments falling out of amendment No. 9, which inserts new subsections (6) to (10), inclusive, into the new section 2B of the 2003 Act and relates to the bringing of an action against an employer.  Amendment No. 13 is a drafting amendment and falls out of the insertion of a new subsection (14) into new section 2B, which is addressed in amendment No. 14.  Amendment No. 14 defines terms used in section 2B.  It also provides that proceedings taken against an employer under section 2B may be brought in the District Court for claims of up to €15,000 and in the Circuit Court for claims of up to €75,000.  We consulted the Courts Service regarding amendment No. 15.  It has indicated that, in the cases provided for by this section, the only relevant interim relief would involve applying for an order preventing the employer dissipating or reducing his or her assets that might be required to meet the claim if the plaintiff were successful.  Such relief would already be available by way of injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  If by this amendment the Deputy is proposing that the plaintiff could apply for an advance of money that he or she might get in a settlement or court determination, the Courts Service has indicated that it is unaware of such relief being available where there is a dispute and pointed to the danger that allowing relief as proposed would pre-empt the outcome of the proceedings where the case remained to be determined.  Therefore, on grounds that it is unnecessary or possibly ill advised, I am not accepting the proposed amendment.  The shoulder note for section 4 of the Bill as published must be amended to read: "Insertion into Act of 2003 of new sections 2B and 2C".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	I am sure the Deputy will accept that as the Younis case is sub judice I am limited in terms of what I can say in that regard.  In regard to the Deputy's point generally in terms of the robustness of the provisions when a complaint is made, it is the responsibility of NERA to investigate complaints and to ensure that the system stands up to scrutiny.  In regard to the compensatory element of the Deputy's question, the particular case mentioned - I am couching my language-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	The Minister can also take a case if there has been a breach of the law.  This is where NERA comes into the equation.  When a complaint is made, there is a robust investigation of potential exploitation with clear outcomes.  On the compensation issue, the compensation provided for is the national minimum wage or other mandatory statutory rates of pay for the job.  We determined this when dealing with Deputy Tóibín's amendments.  This is provided for in law so that there is no ambiguity.  The complex standards of proof arise where a court is determining how much compensation should be paid.  It is necessary to remove that ambiguity.  In terms of the specific case mentioned, the question that arises is whether there is a legal contract of employment.  What we are doing is moving to a situation whereby a person who makes a complaint and has acted reasonably in terms of his or her employment conditions and had a reasonable expectation of having a contract will also be covered by this legislation.  We are putting a belt and braces approach around the existing legislation such that there is a comfort for anybody who finds themselves in an exploitative situation that they can come forward and make a complaint and that there is a corpus of law that does not put a prohibitive cost on them in so doing because there is a statutory body, namely, NERA, that exists to err on their side where exploitation occurs.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	It is an illegal scenario.  The distinction that must be made is that this applies where no legal contract exists.  I will try to clarify the matter.  It is not the intention of the civil proceedings to provide compensation based on the market or statutory rate for the job but rather to provide compensation in a situation where there is no legal contract.  The national minimum wage is clear and unambiguous.  If there are other statutory provisions that apply to certain rates for certain types of jobs, then there is no ambiguity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	If there is a contract of employment-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	That is on the basis that there is a legal contract in place.  If an employer provides an employee with a contract of employment, there is a rate for the job inherent in that contract.  We are providing for a situation in which no legal contract is provided and to allow in respect of an employee who has no legal contract and is exploited for him or her to be compensated on the basis of the national minimum wage or as provided by statute.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	While I accept the spirit of the amendment, I respectfully suggest that it is incongruous.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	The purpose of this legislation is to provide for cases where there is no legal contract.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	Is the Deputy by virtue of his amendment placing the burden of proof on the person who is being exploited to prove that another employee has a different contract?  What submissions will in this regard be made to the court?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:30:00+01:00	How would that be done before a court of law?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I genuinely take the amendment in the spirit in which it is proposed, but one must consider the legislation in its entirety.  For the first time we are providing clarity for the courts where exploitation takes place and a judgment is made in a case in which there is no contract.  We are bolting to it, for want of a better term, a de minimis compensatory regime which will at least allow a person where there is a finding in his or her favour to receive compensation based on statutory provisions.  In previous court cases there was a lack of clarity.  I respectfully contend the amendment as proposed by Deputy Peadar Tóibín could provide for a case in which proceedings could be delayed or the burden of proof on the person being exploited or who could be potentially exploited could become completely unwieldy, as clarity could not be provided for.  The sections before us provide clarity and there is absolutely no ambiguity about the rate of compensation being provided for where there is no legal contract.  It is on that basis that we are not accepting amendment No. 8.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 9:In page 7, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“(6) Proceedings under this section shall not be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the day on which the foreign national ceased his or her employment or service with the employer, a person referred to in section 2(1A)(a) or contractor referred to in section 2(1A)(b).(7) Proceedings under this section shall not be brought in respect of any work, or services, done or rendered more than 6 years prior to the day on which the proceedings are instituted.(8) Subsection (7) shall apply to proceedings under this section whether the work was done or the services were rendered before or on or after the coming into operation of section 4 of the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014.(9) Without prejudice to subsection (6), proceedings under this section shall not be brought where—(a) the foreign national, in respect of any right of action he or she may have and whether such right of action arises pursuant to any enactment or otherwise, has—(i) instituted proceedings in relation to the same, or substantially the same, work done or services rendered as referred to in this section, or(ii) otherwise commenced an action or other claim in relation to the same, or substantially the same, work done or services rendered as referred to in this section,and(b) those proceedings have, or that action or claim has, not been finally determined.(10) In proceedings instituted by the Minister under this section the court shall not award costs in favour of the foreign national but may award costs in favour of the Minister.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 10:In page 7, line 28, to delete “(6) The amount” and substitute “(11) The amount”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 11:In page 7, line 32, to delete “(7) In proceedings” and substitute “(12) In proceedings”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 12:In page 7, line 37, to delete “(8) Subsection (5)” and substitute “(13) Subsection (5)”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 13:In page 7, to delete line 39 and substitute “behalf.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:40:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 14:In page 7, after line 39, to insert the following:“(14) In this section—‘Act of 2006’ means the Employment Permits Act 2006;‘national minimum hourly rate of pay’ has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2006.
Section 2B: supplemental provisions
	2C. (1) The District Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under section 2B where the amount claimed in the proceedings does not exceed €15,000.	(2) The jurisdiction of the District Court under this section shall be exercised by the judge of the District Court for the time being assigned to 	the district court district in which the person against whom the proceedings are brought resides or carries on business.	(3) The Circuit Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine proceedings under section 2B where the amount claimed in the proceedings 	does not exceed €75,000.	(4) The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court shall be exercised by the judge of the Circuit Court for the time being assigned to the circuit in which 	the person against whom the proceedings are brought resides or carries on business.”.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:50:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 16:In page 8, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:" 'civil partnership registration' has the meaning assigned to it by the Act of 2010;‘connected’, in relation to the connection between a connected person and a foreign employer, means—(a) the connected person is a subsidiary of the foreign employer,(b) the foreign employer is a subsidiary of the connected person,(c) the connected person and the foreign employer are both subsidiaries of a holding company that carries on business in the State or outside the State, or(d) the connected person and the foreign employer have entered into an agreement with another person whereby each of them agree to carry on business or provide services with each other in more than one state and to carry on business or provide services in the manner provided for in the agreement;”.The Bill explicitly provides for a permit type in intra-company transfer situations.  While the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's employer is outside the State, that is a foreign employer, the employment permit holder is carrying out duties for, or participating in a training programme with, the connected person, that is the Irish entity.     The provisions of the Bill regarding to intra-company transfer employment permits must respect the employer-employee contractual relationship that exists between the foreign employer and intra-company transfer employment permit holder.  For this reason, any reference in the Bill to the connected person, that could suggest that it was the employer, have been removed and a number of sections redrafted accordingly.  Amendment No. 16 defines the term "connected", which refers to the affiliation between a foreign and an Irish company for the purposes of granting an intra-company transfer employment permit.  The intention of the amendment is to tighten up and more clearly define the nature of the connections between the foreign employer and connected person, and consequently the definition of the terms "holding company" at amendment No. 21 and "subsidiary" at amendment No. 23 are required.  Amendment No. 16 also defines "civil partnership registration" in terms of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The term is used throughout the Bill in the context of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit.  Amendment No. 21 also defines the terms "health insurance", "health insurer" and "medical treatment" as these terms need to be defined in the context of the revised definition of remuneration at amendment No. 24, which I will address later. Amendments Nos. 17 and 20 further amend the definitions of connected person and foreign employer and are consequential to amendment No. 16.  Amendment No. 22 is consequential to amendment No. 23.  Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, inclusive, are drafting amendments and are consequential.  Amendment No. 48 is a consequential technical amendment.  Amendment No. 49 provides for sector-specific employment permits.  Amendment No. 50 provides for the duration of an employment permit in respect of an intra-company transfer to be set out on that permit.  Amendment No. 52 specifies the persons to whom copies of an employment permit should issue.  With regard to amendments Nos. 72 and 104, it is critical that the Minister is satisfied that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of board and-or accommodation for the duration of the permit holder's stay in the State.    Amendments Nos. 99 to 101, inclusive, are consequential technical amendments.  Amendment No. 103 brings the connected person and relevant person, that is, the person in the State with whom a contractor has entered into a contract of service, into the scope of the revocation provisions of section 16 of the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 107 is a technical amendment and is consequential to amendment No. 106.  Amendment No. 108 is consequential to the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.  It provides that the Minister may revoke----- 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:50:00+01:00	Shall I just go through the amendments and then come back?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T11:50:00+01:00	Yes.  Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8).  Please forgive me but I have omitted a few amendments.  Amendment No. 113 allows the connected person to apply for a review.  Amendment No. 114 is a consequential amendment following on from the treatment of the intra-company transfer in the Bill.  Amendment No. 118 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 119.  Amendment No. 156 is a technical amendment consequential to amendment No. 157 which inserts a new subsection (3A).  Amendment No. 158 provides that the connected person who contravenes subsection (3A) is guilty of an offence.  Amendment No. 159 requires the connected person to surrender the copy of the employment permit where the employment it concerns has been, for any reason, terminated by the foreign employer or the foreign national ceases to carry out duties for, or participate in a training programme provided by, the connected person.  Also, failure by the connected person or the permit holder to do so is an offence under section 24(2), as amended by section 24(c) of the Bill.  The amendment guards against abuse of the permits system by ensuring that all parties are aware of the employment status of foreign nationals who are permit-required.  Amendment No 161 requires the connected person to retain records pertaining to the intra-company transfer employment permit holder's duties or training programme and the employment concerned.  Amendment No. 162 provides that failure by the connected person to comply with new record keeping requirements is an offence under section 27(8), as amended by section 27 of the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	I work for many employers in Cork East and I hope they will keep employing me.  In regard to amendment No. 49, providing for sector-specific employment permits would only be possible were the Department to waive all checks on the employer, which the Minister cannot accept.  Currently, all employers of permit holders are on the Department's database which is regularly checked by the National Employment Rights Authority as part of their compliance with the permits legislation.  Part of the evaluation of the employment permit application is to check the bona fides of the employer as well as establishing that there are actual labour shortages for the job to be filled.  Refusals arise where the employer is not deemed to be operating legitimately and where no such labour shortage is demonstrated.  The Minister considers that the Deputy's amendment would make a targeted approach to meeting labour market skills shortages through the permit system impossible.  It would also significantly weaken the ability of the State to control and monitor employers of permit holders.  It is on that basis that we cannot accept the proposed amendments.  However, it must be said that we exercise discretion in humanitarian circumstances and where it is less than 12 months-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	If we go back to the bondage element, as the Deputy so described it, section 12(1)(e) of the 2006 Act provides that, in respect of the foreign national’s first employment permit, he or she remains with the employer for a minimum period of 12 months and the Minister can refuse an application for a second employment permit made during that period and the foreign national already has an employment permit in force.  It should be noted that this is a “may” provision  -  this allows the Department to consider such an application within the 12 month period where the Department has exception policies that have general effect - for example, humanitarian grounds where the employer has moved to a different location in the country.   Such exceptions to section 12(1)(e), when finalised, will be made publicly available.  However, in such an instance, the foreign national will have to apply for a new permit and will have to adhere to the conditions applying to that permit where applicable - in other words, where there is a labour market needs test.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	Again, we should go back to the body of the legislation.  What is the purpose of permits legislation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	Will the Deputy relay what he understands to be the meaning of this legislation in regard to permits so that I can understand his point?  A permit is to fill a position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	That is a given.  Regardless of the political party from which we come or our political hue or political persuasion, as citizens, we all subscribe to the notion that the human rights and the employment conditions under which any worker works comply with the law and that he or she enjoys full entitlements inherent in any contract he or she has.  However, that still does not answer the Deputy's question.  The binding arrangement - to use those words - is for the first 12 months only.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	They are.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 24:In page 10, to delete lines 7 to 15 and substitute the following:"(e) by substituting the following definition for the definition of "remuneration":" 'remuneration' shall be construed in accordance with section 1A;",(f) by deleting the definition of "employment regulation order", and(g) by deleting the definition of "registered employment agreement".".The Minister's preference is for all employment holders to be employed, salaried and paid under an Irish employment contract.  However, in the case of the intra-company transfer employment permit and contract for services employment permit, he acknowledges that the employment in the State is temporary and so facilitates the permit holder remaining on the foreign payroll.  However, this concession has, in practice, introduced a level of complexity to the evaluation of documentation submitted to support such applications.  This has resulted in considerable engagement with applications leading to delay and in some cases refusal.    Amendment No. 24 provides for the insertion of a new section 1A into the Act of 2006.  Amendment No. 25 provides the new definition of remuneration for the purposes of the employment permits Acts and fulfils two important functions.On the one hand, it offers a clear definition of what is meant by remuneration and how it is to be provided for all categories of employment permit. This provides clarity and certainty to employers. On the other hand, it introduces clear rules for those applying for intra-company transfer and contract for services employment permits, covering remuneration, duration of time with foreign employer, requirements to top up to Irish statutory minimum wages as well as €40,000 minimum remuneration threshold, before a permit will be issued. Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 set out the principles applying to the remuneration paid to the holders of intra-company transfer employment permits and contract for services employment permits. Amendment No. 73 makes it imperative that the intra-company transfer employment permit holder is adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of the permit holder’s stay in the State. Amendments Nos. 74 and 76 enable the Minister to refuse to grant an intra-company transfer employment permit or contract for services employment permit where he or she is satisfied that the health insurance provided is not similar to that provided by a registered health insurer in the State. Amendment No. 75 is consequential to amendment No. 74, while amendment No. 81 is consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 82 allows the Minister to refuse to grant an employment permit for an intra-company transfer or a contract for services where the conditions relating to remuneration and the provision of information on remuneration set out in the amendments to section 6 of the 2006 Act are not met. Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 are also both consequential to amendment No. 82. Amendment No. 102 removes a reference to "other benefits" that can be taken into account so as to make it clear that only accommodation, board and health insurance are reckonable components for computing the remuneration to be paid to a foreign national. Amendments Nos. 105 and 106 provide the Minister with revocation grounds if the holder of the intra-company transfer or contract for services permit is not adequately provided for in terms of health insurance for the duration of his or her stay in the State. Amendment No. 109 clarifies that the remuneration in question is the salary as set out in the definition of remuneration at new section 1A to be inserted into the Act of 2006 and that the salary must not be less than national minimum wage. Amendment No. 110 inserts a cross-reference to section 12(6)(b) which pertains to the hourly rate specified under an enactment, such as any successor to the employment regulation orders or registered employment agreements. Amendment No. 111 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 112. The latter amendment provides for the revocation of an employment permit where the required statement of earnings does not comply with the requirements of new section 3D(1)(c) or section 3E(1)(b) to be inserted into the Act of 2006 in respect of intra-company transfer or contract for services employment permits. Finally, amendment No. 116 provides for information, documents and evidence to be prescribed under section 29 at renewal stage and the provision of such information within a prescribed period. It also requires the provision, at renewal stage, of information on the remuneration paid to the foreign national during the period for which a intra-company transfer or a contract services employment permit was granted.  I am considering some further minor amendments to section 5 of the Bill and will revert at Report Stage on these.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 25:In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:
“Insertion into Act of 2006 of new section 1A
6. The Act of 2006 is amended by inserting the following section after section 1:
“Definition of ‘remuneration’
1A. (1) In this Act ‘remuneration’ means—(a) subject to paragraph (b), the total amount of—(i) the salary that is paid to the foreign national, the hourly rate of which shall not be less than the national minimum hourly rate of pay or, where appropriate to the employment in respect of which the application is made, the hourly rate referred to in section 12(6)(b), and(ii) a payment for health insurance in respect of a foreign national should he or she require medical treatment for illness or injury during the period for which the  employment permit is in force and which is made to a health insurer by the person who made the offer of employment,or(b) in respect of an employment permit granted for the purposes referred to in section 3A(2)(d) and 3A(2)(e), the total amount of—(i) the salary that is paid to the foreign national, the hourly rate of which shall be not less than the national minimum hourly rate of pay or, where appropriate to the employment in respect of which the application is made, the hourly rate referred to in section 12(6)(b),(ii) a payment for board and accommodation, or either of them, or the monetary value of board and accommodation directly provided by the connected person, foreign employer or contractor, and(iii) a payment for health insurance in respect of a foreign national should he or she require medical treatment for illness or injury during the period for which the employment permit is in force and which is made by the foreign employer or the connected person or both of them or by the contractor to—(I) a health insurer, or(II) a person outside the State who provides insurance for medical treatment in respect of the foreign national that has the same, or similar, effect as the health insurance provided by a health insurer.(2) In this Act—(a) references to remuneration in relation to an application for the grant of an employment permit and the consideration of such application by the Minister shall be construed as the remuneration, specified in that application, that is proposed to be paid by—(i) the person who has made the offer of employment in respect of which the application is made,(ii) in the case of an employment permit for the purpose referred to in section 3A(2)(d), the foreign employer, in accordance with section 3D and the payments in respect of the remuneration to be paid, in accordance with section 3D, by the connected person, or(iii) in the case of an employment permit for the purpose referred to in section 3A(2)(e), the contractor in accordance with section 3E,and(b) references to remuneration after a permit has been granted shall be construed as the remuneration paid to the holder of the permit by an employer, a foreign employer in accordance with section 3D, a connected person in accordance with section 3D, or a contractor in accordance with section 3E, during the period for which the employment permit has been granted in respect of the employment for which the employment permit was granted.”.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 26:In page 10, line 32, to delete “for which a high level of remuneration is paid” and substitute “that are in critical short supply in the State,”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:10:00+01:00	Regarding amendment No. 27, the purpose of providing access to the Irish labour market to the spouses, civil partners and dependants of critical skills employment permit holders and third country researchers under Council Directive 2005/71/EC is to differentiate Ireland by enhancing its attractiveness as a destination for this cohort of highly-skilled migrants when compared with our competitors.  As such, this is a deliberate policy decision.  During drafting of the Bill, the issue of separation and divorce was considered.  The legal advice the Department received was that the Bill cannot cross over into the legislative domain of the Minister for Justice and Equality determining or defining separation or divorce.  Second, the question for the Minister for the purposes of the dependant, partner or spouse employment permit is whether there is a subsisting relationship of spouse, partner or dependant, that is, it is for the applicant of such permit to satisfy the Minister that he or she is a spouse, partner or dependant at the time of application or renewal.  The status of relationships between the primary permit holder and his or her family members is a matter for the Irish Immigration and Naturalisation Service under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The situation pertaining to the presence in the State of former partners or spouses of primary permits holders is in the first instance a matter for that Minister.  Establishing the situation of a spouse or civil partner whose relationship with the primary permit holder has come to an end is beyond the remit of the employment permits system.  However, the reactivation employment permit scheme should facilitate such individuals whose circumstances have changed and who have obtained permission from the Department of Justice and Equality to remain in the State in their own right.  On this basis, the majority of cases of separated spouses will be capable of being catered for in the new permits system and as such, I am not accepting the Deputy’s amendment
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	The reactivation employment permit scheme would have to take account of the circumstances described by the Deputy where, through no fault of his or her own, a person's relationship has broken down.  We are trying to deal with their situation humanely.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	No.  There is no labour market needs test.  The statutory provisions still apply.  To be clear, a labour market needs test is not required for a reactivation employment permit.  For the record, the main criterion to be applied to reactivation is that the remuneration must be the national minimum wage or higher.  This applies to applications for employment permits in respect of all occupations except occupations in a domestic setting.  The prospective employee must possess the relevant qualifications, skills or experience required for the employment.  Applications will only be accepted in respect of employees who previously entered the legal market legally on foot of an employment permit, are holders of a temporary stamp 1 and have a reactivation employment permit letter from the Department of Justice and Equality.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	As long as they meet the conditions, yes, absolutely.  There is an understanding that people who come into the country put down roots and have families.  They are embedded in the community.  Should the relationship break down, there is a sense that it will be dealt with humanely, allowing for all factors to be taken into consideration.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 29:In page 11, lines 28 and 29, to delete “in employments that”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 30:In page 11, line 30, to delete “are” and substitute “in employments that are”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 31:In page 11, line 33, to delete “require” and substitute “in employments that require”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	The conditions pertaining to the issue of a permit under the new section 3A are all mandatory.  This is to deter abuses of the proposed reactivation employment permit.  An application cannot be considered if the foreign national does not meet all of the criteria.  Deputy Tóibín's amendment would result in an additional mandatory provision that very few foreign nationals would be able to meet - that is, only foreign nationals who have entered into civil proceedings, which would significantly narrow the field of potential applicants under this permit type.  The Minister's intention in creating this type of employment permit is to facilitate those foreign nationals who have fallen out of the employment permit system to re-enter employment in line with employment permits legislation.  It is not a back door for illegal economic migrants who have not been, or would not be under current legislation, granted employment permits.  An amendment to facilitate this would run counter to the Government's broad policy on employment permits.  It is on that basis that I cannot accept this amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	There is a provision in the legislation to allow for the Minister to take the case.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	The answer to the Deputy's query is.  A case can be made to the Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T12:20:00+01:00	To ensure there is no ambiguity, in saying that a case can be made to the Minister, I mean that a case can be made from a legislative perspective through the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA.  That is not cumbersome.  We are not talking about the Minister's private office.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 33:In page 12, to delete line 24.The internship employment permit is designed to facilitate the employment in the State of foreign nationals who are full-time students enrolled in a third level institution outside the State for the purpose of gaining work experience.  Amendments No. 33 and 35 are consequential to amendment No. 34.  Amendment No. 34 ensures this type of permit is expressly linked to skills shortages clearly identified by the expert group on future skills needs.  Amendment No. 36 restricts its duration to a period of 12 months.  Amendment No. 77 is consequential to amendment No. 78, which enables the Minister to refuse to grant an internship employment permit if he or she is not satisfied that the course or the employment in question relates to skills that are designated by regulations and clearly identified by the expert group on future skills needs to be in short supply.  Amendment No. 79 is consequential to amendment No. 78.  Amendment No. 80 provides for the 12-month duration of an internship employment permit.  I am considering further minor amendments to section 6 of the Bill.  I will revert to the Dáil on the matter on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:10:00+01:00	I ask the Deputy to bear with me for a moment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 34:In page 12, to delete lines 25 to 27 and substitute the following:"(ii) pursuing a course of study that is wholly or substantially concerned with the qualifications or skills referred to in section 15(1)(c) and the Minister is satisfied, having regard to section 15(1)(d), there is a shortage of those skills or qualifications, and(iii) required, for the completion of that course of study, to obtain experience in the practice of those skills or qualifications with which the course of study is concerned for a period of not more than 12 months in an employment that requires the practice of those skills or qualifications,".

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:10:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 45:In page 17, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:"(i) provide the Minister with information, documents and evidence, as to whether, in respect of section 4(5)—(i) a person was, in the period referred to in section 4(5), employed in the employment that is the subject of the application, and(ii) that person was not, within such period, dismissed by reason of redundancy from that employment.".".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:10:00+01:00	This amendment section 8 will insert a new subsection (i) into section 6 of the 2006 Act to require that information, documents and evidence pertaining to a position that was the subject of a redundancy be submitted upon application.To provide greater context, this goes back to previous amendments. Amendments Nos. 18 and 19, respectively, define the date of dismissal and dismissal by reason of redundancy, in terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967. This is required in the context of provisions in section 22 of the Bill dealing with holders of critical skills employment permits and general employment permits who have been made redundant, as well as provisions in section 7 of the Bill that prohibit an employment permit application being made where the employment concerned was the subject of redundancy in the preceding six months. To provide further clarification on amendment No. 40, it ensures that employment permits are not issued in respect of vacancies that have arisen through or were positions subject to redundancy in the preceding six months. It is designed to prevent the possibility of an employer making existing staff redundant in order to replace them with non-EEA nationals. It is important that the legislation has safeguards against distortions to the labour market. This is one such safeguard. Amendment No. 45 adds a requirement that information regarding any recent redundancies which may relate to a vacancy for which an application is being made be submitted as part of the employment permit.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:20:00+01:00	I would like to tease out the scenario the Deputy paints a little.  Does he have a specific case in mind?  This should be covered by other law, but if there is a lacuna, that is something that could be raised.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:20:00+01:00	That would be my instinct, because I do not know if it is appropriate to the purposes of this legislation.  It may not be applicable.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:20:00+01:00	We will consider some amendments to section 8 for Report Stage.

This supports Government policy to ensure Irish and EEA nationals currently in the labour market are the first cohort employers should look to.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 60, inclusive, are technical.  Amendment No. 62 is also technical.  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting amendment.  Amendments Nos. 64, 65, 69 and 70 are technical and consequential to amendment No. 62.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:40:00+01:00	The conditions whereby an employment permit may be granted or refused are set out in clear detail in the legislation.  Reviews of decisions on the granting of employment permits are provided for in section 13 of the Act of 2006.  That section sets out that a review of a decision to refuse an employment permit shall be carried out by an officer of a grade senior to the grade of the person who made the refusal decision.  The segregation of duties in the employment permits area is applied accordingly.  The clarity imposed by the new provisions, in conjunction with this clear review structure, ensures the application, the refusal and the review process are based on transparent and explicit rules with a basis in law.  In this context, it is the Minister’s view that setting up an independent process would create an unnecessary extra layer of administration with cost implications and no discernible benefits.  On this basis, I do not accept the Deputy’s amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:40:00+01:00	How in the Deputy’s mind would this occur?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:40:00+01:00	I am informed that the refusal rate is approximately 12%.  There is a 28 day time limit for appeals.  Is the Deputy referring to the length of time it takes thereafter?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:40:00+01:00	Forgive me if I am misunderstanding the amendment, but how does the Deputy envisage it working in practical terms?  Would there be a designated person within the Department, a higher officer?  Who would be the independent person?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:40:00+01:00	We will table some minor amendments to the section on Report Stage.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:50:00+01:00	Mo bhrón, mo bhrón.  The Department has considered the waiving of fees in exceptional circumstances.  However, the Bill is intended to place the issue of employment permits on a clear, statutory basis to a level of detail which precludes consideration on a case-by-case basis of the widely varied circumstances of individual applicants.  This is what would be required were the Deputy's amendment to be accepted.  Furthermore, the grounds on which such a waiver might be applied would necessarily be based on a third-party and possibly unsubstantiated report into the circumstances of the applicant, or an investigation into those circumstances, which would likely cause considerable delay in the issuing of the permit and consequently might jeopardise the employment in prospect.  The levels at which fees are set will be stipulated by regulations and the Minister is committed to carrying out a review of the fees for employment permits later in the year.  More than 40% of applicants currently pay no fees.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:50:00+01:00	It is €1,000 for a two-year period.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:50:00+01:00	The system is a fair one.  Where an employer is seeking to bring in somebody because he or she has a specific set of skills and no domestic candidate is suitable, then the employer will pay the fee if it wants the person badly enough.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:50:00+01:00	I am informed by my officials that there will be a handful of amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T13:50:00+01:00	I cannot give an exact number but we will try to minimise it.  They will be technical as opposed to substantive amendments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T14:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 130:In page 41, line 2, to delete “within the meaning of section 7(2) of the Act of 1967” and substitute “from the employment concerned”.These amendments are technical and semantic in nature.  I want to make sure there is nothing that needs to be explained.  We have discussed previously the redundancy provisions relating to a six month period and I do not propose to repeat those points.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T14:00:00+01:00	I move amendment No. 135:In page 41, to delete lines 23 to 38 and substitute the following:“(4) Where—(a) on the date an application referred to in subsection (3) is made, the type of employment referred to in subsection (3)(a)—(i) is no longer specified in regulations under section 14 as an employment, or no longer falls within a category of employment specified in those regulations, for which an employment permit may be granted in respect of the purpose referred to in subsection (1), or(ii) is specified in regulations under section 14 as an employment, or falls within a category of employment, in respect of which an employment permit shall not be granted,and(b) the Minister is satisfied that the dismissal by the employer of the foreign national from the employment in respect of which the employment permit referred to in subsection (1) was granted, was a dismissal by reason of redundancy, the application may be made for that employment by a foreign national to whom this section applies notwithstanding that the employment is no longer an employment, or falls within a category of employment, for which an employment permit may be granted or is an employment, or falls within a category of employment specified in regulations under section 14 for which an employment permit shall not be granted.”.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-06-26T14:00:00+01:00	The documentation required to be submitted within four weeks of the date of dismissal by reason of redundancy will be set out in regulations.  Such documentation is likely to include a letter from the previous employer stating the permit holder has been made redundant within the past six months and an explanation as to why, the previous employer's certified copy of the permit issued for that permit holder and a copy of the P45 which must be dated within the past six months.  The provision of this documentation establishes the bone fides of the circumstances applying.  Only rarely does the Department come across instances where such documentation has not been forthcoming from previous employers.  In practice, where this does arise, it will request that the documentation be forwarded directly and the matter is resolved in this manner.  The amendment is not necessary.
