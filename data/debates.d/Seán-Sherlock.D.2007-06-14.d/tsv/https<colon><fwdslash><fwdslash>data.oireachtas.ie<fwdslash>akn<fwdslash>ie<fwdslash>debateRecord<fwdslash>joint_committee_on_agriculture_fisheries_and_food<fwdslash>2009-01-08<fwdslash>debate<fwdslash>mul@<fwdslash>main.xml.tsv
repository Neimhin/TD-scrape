SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Does the Department acknowledge there was a systems failure and that the Department itself has some degree of culpability for what happened in December.  We are now in a situation where an allowance of up to €180 million has been made available from taxpayers' money to assist an industry that could have been on its knees because of that same systems failure.  I would like the Department to acknowledge this publicly today.I will get straight into the specifics and ask whether the substance that was used in the Millstream plant in Bunclody was illegal.  To refer specifically to——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Let us get to the specifics straight away.  If I may, I will go straight to what has been said.  The Secretary General states that laboratory tests have indicated that the source of the contamination was the use of contaminated or inappropriate oil to fire the burner used for generating the heat to dry the bread.  We are also told the Garda is now assisting the process.  I would like to know whether an illegal process was taking place or whether it was a process that is not governed by regulation.  If it was an illegal process, that is fair enough, and I am sure the full rigour of the law will apply, but if it was not governed by proper regulation in the first instance, that speaks to the fact there was a systems failure which put the whole industry practically on its knees for that period.To be frank, I welcome the political actions taken to deal with this matter in terms of the withdrawal, which was necessary.  However, serious questions arise about the failure of regulation.  Why was it, in the first 24 hours of the crisis, that ordinary people and those like myself did not know who was answerable in terms of the food regulatory regime?  We did not know whether it was the Food Safety Authority of Ireland or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and there was some degree of confusion.  If we are to learn anything from this debate, I suggest there must be one voice in this country speaking on the issue of food safety.  Somebody should be appointed, not necessarily a new regulatory regime, but one voice who will come out definitively to speak when such issues arise.  This is vital and will get rid of any confusion on such issues.While I will leave it at that for now, the Department's officials should acknowledge whether they consider that a systems failure took place in the first instance.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would there have been an obligation on the part of the Dutch at that stage to notify the EFSA as to the high levels of dioxins in the September testing?  It seems, from what Mr. Moran stated, that it was only when the Department gave notification through the website that the information seemed to come to light.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The delegation will forgive my ignorance, but I seek an understanding of the process between September and December.  The Secretary General stated that the information first came to his attention on 5 December and that testing took place in September which clearly indicated markers for polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs, in the Netherlands.  Even if there was no specific indication of the source of the PCBs, surely there was some notification to the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, indicating there were PCB markers discovered within the European Union.  Was the EFSA notified or not?  If it was not notified, perhaps there was no obligation to do so.  Perhaps the Secretary General could clarify this for the committee.  Such an explanation would tally events up to 5 December.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I do not understand what Mr. Moran is saying.  Forgive my ignorance, but I do not understand the point the Secretary General is making.  He stated that there was a background test carried out by the French which took place in September.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	He said it was a French test.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will continue as I am trying to understand events.  The Secretary General stated that the test results came back to the FSAI.  Where was the communication to the FSAI?  What was communicated to it and did it relate to an Irish carcase?  Did this occur in September?  This is what we are trying to find out.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the same point, the French and Belgians had a line of communication with the Dutch dating back to September.  I understand that while PCBs were found, it was not established that they emanated from Ireland until 4 December when the press release was issued.  Was there an onus on the Netherlands or any other member state for that matter to notify the European Food Safety Authority of the existence of PCBs?  Should all other countries not have been alerted to this fact?  That is the key point on which the joint committee requires clarification.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	For the purposes of the HACCP legislation, would the operator at the centre of this dioxin issue have been deemed a food business operator?  Going back to my initial contribution, if the source of the contamination was as a result of the use of contaminated or inappropriate oil to fire the burner used for generating the heat to dry the bread, which are Mr. Moran's own words, does the HACCP or any other legislation govern the use of a particular type of fuel for the purposes of producing feedstuffs for cattle or pigs within the Irish market?  Does such legislation apply to any foodstuffs for that matter?If that is the case, is it proposed that a regulation be brought in to ensure particular types of fuel are used or that there be a regulatory framework governing the types of fuel?  My interpretation — I should be corrected if I am wrong — is that no legislation governs the type of fuel used in the production of feedstuffs.  Forgive me if I am wrong but I seek clarification on the matter.With regard to traceability, I take Deputy Scanlon's point about the nature of the beast, so to speak, with regard to traceability right down to the end use.  I acknowledge that when the problem was identified, it was easy within a reasonable timeframe to identify the source of the contamination and its consequences.  Is every single foodstuff regulated?  Are all FBOs governed by the HACCP legislation?  Was there a failure of regulation in this regard?  For example, was a contaminant used which, to all intents and purposes, brought a €1 billion industry — to use the Department's own figures — to its knees as a result of such a failure?  This is something consumers need to know about as well.  If we do not learn from this or put in place mechanisms to ensure that all aspects of food production are covered by some degree of regulation, there is no reason this cannot happen again.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I raised the point about the fuels used to produce the feedstuffs and whether that is governed by a regulation.  If it is, was there an onus on the food business operator in this instance to notify as per the national control plan for Ireland in terms of the hygiene package?  I did not get an answer to that question.  I wish to ascertain whether the fuels used in feedstuffs are governed by a regulation.  There is a simple "Yes" or "No" answer to that question.  That will establish whether illegal activity was going on.If we are taking about a bailout using €180 million of taxpayers' money, then it is right that some of these questions are answered in terms of the regulatory framework.  The Department officials need to answer those questions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The oil question speaks to the traceability question because it is an input used in producing the foodstuff.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of information.  If the HACCP legislation does not cover the use of oil, can one then infer that there is no regulation governing the use of fuels for the production of feedstuffs?  If that is the case, as a result of what happened, will there be a move to set up a regulatory framework so that this State and every other state in the European Union can then ensure dioxins of this nature will never again get into the food chain in the way that happened recently?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is important that we get to the nub of this.  On the one hand, we are being told the food business operators have a duty of care, if one likes, to ensure against any potential hazards, which is the whole purpose of the legislation.  However, if I understand correctly what Mr. Moran is saying, there is no overarching governing regulation at EU level in regard to the use of oils for the production of feedstuffs.  Is there, therefore, an onus on the person who is producing the feedstuffs or is this just a failure of regulation and, therefore, anybody can use any kind of oil as fuel for the production of feedstuffs?It seems the HACCP legislation does not actually govern the production of feedstuffs.  Perhaps now, as a result of this crisis, there is a necessity for some sort of regulation relating to the use of particular types of fuels.  This is a view on which this committee needs to get some sort of a steer, whether it is a political or an apolitical issue.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Since the Taoiseach referred to the term "contingent liability" at some point after 6 December, I have been at pains to find a definition of the phrase as it pertains to this case.  I expect the €180 million package arises from the fact that a recall was issued at the Government's behest.  As a result, those innocent producers, if I may use that phraseology, who, through no fault of their own, used a certain type of product lost production and suffered a loss in profit.  They are, therefore, entitled to some compensation.  What is the Department's view of the compensation scheme and the €180 million fund in terms of liability?  I would like to have a better understanding of this issue as it goes to the heart of the scheme.I also wish to ask about the statement made by the Secretary General that the scheme is confined to processors who have suffered losses as a result of the recall, and to product relating to animals slaughtered in Ireland between 1 September and 6 December 2008 which cannot be shown to be uncontaminated.  Is it the case that only those people who used the contaminated product will be liable for the compensation package?  I seek clarification on that point.  To date, a payment of €35.4 million has been made and there are 64 payments.  Is that 64 payments to 64 individuals or have some individuals received more than one payment?I am concerned also about the workers who sustained a loss of income as a result of the crisis.  When the processors closed down, many farm workers and others within the processing industry lost income.  The question can be asked whether they should be entitled to some form of compensation package for loss of earnings through no fault of their own.  Will Mr. Moran provide some clarification on that?Hundreds of pig farmers are sustaining a serious loss of income through no fault of their own, who were not directly affected by or who had never used the contaminated product.  The question can be asked also as to whether they should be eligible for some form of compensation.  I seek clarification on the nature of the scheme, how it is proposed to make the payments and whether there will be a full disclosure on how the payments are made and to whom.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked about compensation of workers and whether there is a proposal in the scheme for them.  I also asked about contingent liability.  Can I get a viewpoint on those matters?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I was wondering when the pig in the poke line would be used in the debate.  Deputy Creed got in there.  I asked about contingent liability but I am not satisfied with the answer I received on workers' compensation.  If I am interpreting what the witness said correctly, it was necessary to get the scheme up and running so that workers could get back into the plant but there are still workers who have suffered loss of earnings in the period.  Could I get a clarification, a clear succinct answer, on whether there will be funds available to workers suffering a loss in wages for that period?  Is that envisaged within the scheme?With regard to restoration of the markets, I have a view that there is a degree of political expediency going on from the Russian point of view.  Is it the case that the Russians think we still have a problem or is there a certain degree of political expediency going on from other competitors within the market who would probably have their purposes served by talking down the Irish product?  How far down the line is the Department in terms of restoring some degree of confidence in the product?  Is the issue confidence or market considerations and economics?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We will get to read about it in 30 years' time.
