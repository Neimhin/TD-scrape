SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In reference to the Minister's speech, particularly where he dealt with the principles of taxation, he said the imposition of taxes must be fair and equitable and that a higher rate must apply to those on higher incomes.  That sounds familiar in that it reads exactly like my old leaving certificate economics Folens textbook and whoever wrote that probably did the leaving certificate around the same time as myself.  However, I always understood from my leaving certificate economics that taxation should be progressive, not regressive.  In this instance, the 1% levy is regressive.  Those on the margins and people who predominantly probably voted for Fianna Fáil are being punished for their loyalty.  They are the people who did not benefit extensively during the boom years.  Instead, they went out every day to do as they always did and now they are being punished.  It is the wrong strategy and a regressive measure.  When one takes account of the increases in VAT and other increases in the cost of living, it will have a negative impact on their real income.  The real incomes of those in the low income bracket will be severely affected and for that reason we oppose this measure.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On the price of tobacco, the Labour Party will support the measure on the basis that it will act as a deterrent.  However, in an effort to curb tobacco consumption, we should encourage people to use substitute products and allow those products to be free of VAT.  Products such as Nicorette should be delisted — as currently they can only be sold in pharmacies — and allowed to be sold in supermarkets and to a wider range of people.  I called for such a measure in the previous budget.  I suspect one of the things at play here is that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is firmly in control of that issue.  I take the measure at face value if it is a question of equity but it should be considered in a wider context if it is considered as a health measure.If I were an average Fianna Fáil voter, a male, who liked to back a horse, maybe enjoyed a glass of wine——

SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——and I was a lower or middle income earner, I would be apoplectic when studying this budget.  Many people who fit that demographic voted for Fianna Fáil in the last election and now they will think seriously about how they will vote the next time.  I am also pleased that the Government did not put any VAT on children's clothes or footwear because, by God, if it did, we would definitely be going back to the 1980s.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I refer to the stamp duty on cheques and bills of exchange.  While many people engage in on-line banking and make electronic payments, we have not reached the stage where the bulk of people make such payments by those means.  The facilities do not exist in the community or the commercial sector.  For example, if one goes to a builders' providers it is not always possible to make electronic payments.  This is an unfair measure, especially for older people who still rely on the use of a cheque book.  This is a sneaky way to raise a few bob.Let us suppose a person has a mortgage and there is a life assurance policy tacked on to that mortgage.  Is that person susceptible to the proposed increase vis-à-vis life assurance and investment funds?  This would have the net effect of increasing the cost of mortgages for a certain sector.  It is proposed that this would yield €13 million per year.  I seek clarification on this matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, I asked a question.
