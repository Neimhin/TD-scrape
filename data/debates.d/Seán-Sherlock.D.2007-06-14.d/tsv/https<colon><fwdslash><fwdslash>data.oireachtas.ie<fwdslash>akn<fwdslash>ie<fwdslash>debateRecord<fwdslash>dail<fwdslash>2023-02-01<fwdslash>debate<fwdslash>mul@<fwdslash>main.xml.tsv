SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T17:00:00+00:00	There is no testimony more compelling than that of Deputy Boyd Barrett today because that is a first-hand account. If that does not impact on all of us, and particularly on the Government, then we are in cold times as regards the promulgation of this legislation. I put forward this amendment on Committee Stage because like others, we in the Opposition feel so constrained in seeking to amend legislation. The only tool we have in our toolkit so as to avoid a charge on the Exchequer is to put down these amendments and seek to have them repeated from Committee to Report Stage. This amendment is proportionate. The Minister will say it is not but I would argue with him that it is because this scheme is vast in its undertaking and given the number of people who would be potentially omitted from it, we believe that at the very minimum this amendment deserves to be passed. All it calls for is a report into "whether and to what extent persons engaged in the management, administration or operation of relevant institutions should be permitted or required to contribute to the cost of making payments under this Act". I do not see how that is disproportionate. It seems reasonable to me. Second, the report would examine "whether the 180 days residence requirement provided for in section 13(1) and (4) should be amended or repealed". There is nothing wrong with looking back at a section of legislation that has been passed to ask whether it is fit for purpose and whether it should be reviewed. Third, the report would look into "whether the Scheme should be extended so as to make provision for recognising persons who were boarded out as children as relevant persons".  When I put forward my amendment, which I am happy to share with colleagues, the Minister addressed the issue of the 180 days on Committee Stage. He said:Absences of up to 180 days will not disqualify somebody from making a claim. The reason for that is that we know there were people who, because of what happened in the institutions, the ill health they suffered, the poor conditions or the poor treatment, spent large amounts of time not in the home but in hospital, often returning to the home ...We just want those people to be included. We want any report into or review of the scheme to ensure those people are included so they are not excluded forever or so the next generation of politicians is not revisiting this in 20 or 30 years' time. If the lessons of the last week or two are anything to go by, we will be revisiting this, mark my words, as sure as night follows day. The people who were aged from zero to six months will wish for this to be revisited somewhere down the line. I have no doubt about that. The evidence of the correspondence we have received should be enough to jolt any government into action in respect of that cohort of people who need for this to be dealt with, now and in a contemporary way - not down the line but now. That is the hallmark of fairness, for it to be dealt with in the here and now. In the amendment, we are looking specifically for a report into whether the duration of the scheme should be extended. That is not unreasonable. We were very conscious when we were putting forward the wording of this amendment that we would seek to be reasonable in our approach. We did not want to be rhetorical but ask the Minister in the hope he would see that nothing we are requesting here is unreasonable or disproportionate. That is why we find ourselves here today on Report Stage, because we failed on Committee Stage to have those measures put into the legislation and we are now asking again. We are coming back to the table to ask that those people be looked after. Looking at the Minister's response in respect of section 42 of the Act, he again stated: The intention of section 42 is for two reviews to be conducted on the scheme. One is an interim review to be commenced two years after the establishment day while the other is to be commenced after the completion of the scheme. Section 42 sets out a list of matters that should be considered as part of these reviews and allows for the Minister to specify any additional matter. The Minister has the power to specify any additional matter. Furthermore, he stated, "Section 12 provides that the chief deciding officer shall prepare an annual report on the performance of his or her function and that each annual report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas."We are putting much store in what the chief deciding officer will determine. The Minister can "specify any additional matter." Those were the Minister's words when he spoke on Committee Stage. I am sure he will repeat those words at Report Stage. All we are asking is for the report on the operation of the scheme to include the subsections we have set out in amendment No. 2. That is not an unreasonable request. I say this in an absolutely non-partisan way and in the spirit and tone of being very conscious about the impact of this issue on society. There is a psychological scar on society because of this issue and the attempts by this generation of politicians who have this mandate now to try to improve the scheme in a way that ensures we will not be revisiting this at some future date.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T17:30:00+00:00	To be fair, one could have anticipated the Minister's response because it is consistent with the response on Committee Stage. I was hopeful there would be some movement by the Minister in respect of what we were seeking to do in amendment No. 2. I share the views of Deputy Cairns in respect of the culture that seemingly exists within the Department in respect of the freedom of information request that was put in by Elaine Loughlin and Conall Ó Fátharta, as reported in yesterday's Irish Examiner, which reported: "Premature release of policy deliberations into the public domain carries significant risk to policy decision-making processes, particularly in areas that are highly contentious." Do not infantilise people who have a voice themselves. Do not referred to them as a "vulnerable group". These are people who are well able to stand up for themselves. Do not condescend to them. Do not patronise them. Meet them as equals. We know that the scheme is flawed because we know there are so many who are excluded because of this legislation.We know that quite a number of people will not have access to healthcare. All we are seeking, in what we feel is a very reasonable way, is that the Minister shift a little bit towards the position the Opposition is promulgating. Within the very limited means we have, we want to at least keep on the agenda the very people we are seeking to represent, namely, those who were boarded out, people who were born in mother and baby homes, and the people who are in birth to six months age category. I have a daughter at home who is six months old. Any of us who have children see the importance of the first six months in any child's life and the importance of the interaction between the parent and child. For the life of me, I do not see how, logically, we can exclude people in that category. The logic of the position being taken by the Minister is down to finance and how much money will be spent on the scheme. So many people are being excluded, which is not fair. On that basis, we will press the amendment and seek to vote on it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T17:50:00+00:00	I proposed this amendment and there are five seconds left in the slot.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T17:50:00+00:00	The idea that people cannot institute civil proceedings if they receive a payment is something that will be revisited in law. This will come back to haunt us. There is no doubt about it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T18:40:00+00:00	I raised the issue of the role of chief deciding officer on Committee Stage. There is still no clarity as to the status of that role. Will it be a Civil Service role? Will it be subject to the Public Appointments Service process? What grade will the appointed person be? Is there an equivalent grade within the Civil Service in respect of that role? What role will public representatives have? I draw similarities between when I make representations to the HSE or the Department of Social Protection. There are any number of officers with whom I deal with depending on the issue and there is a hierarchy there. First, we need to be able to make representations, on behalf of our constituents, to the deciding officer or a designated person. Second, what is the infrastructure around that person? What we do not want is a situation in which we are seeking to advocate on behalf of people in a reasonable fashion but we are disbarred from doing so.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2023-02-01T18:40:00+00:00	I need to know, in simple terms, whether I can make representations on behalf of my constituents who present to me regarding their interactions with the office that is to be set up?
