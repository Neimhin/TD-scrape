SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2015-12-17T11:20:00+00:00	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee. I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on the current situation in Northern Ireland and the agreement reached following ten weeks of intensive talks. As members of the committee will know, these talks were brought to a successful conclusion on 17 November 2015 with negotiations resulting in “A Fresh Start – the Stormont House Agreement and Implementation Plan”. The agreement is split into six sections covering ending paramilitarism and tackling organised crime, welfare reform and financial matters including financial supports from the British and Irish Governments and implementation of other aspects of the Stormont House agreement. Regrettably, it was not possible within the timescale of these talks to address all aspects of the Stormont House agreement and this is something I will return to in more detail later.  The Fresh Start agreement is not a final destination but represents a significant step forward towards normalising politics and society. Considering where we began, in terms of the threat to the very existence of the devolved power sharing institutions, the agreement’s fundamental achievement is the stability it has brought to the institutions so that they are now in a position to deliver for the people of Northern Ireland. With the strong support of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and I, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland worked with the five main political parties in Northern Ireland to ensure the threat of collapse was overcome and the political impasse was resolved. All parties around the table worked tirelessly to ensure Northern Ireland did not fall off the precipice and that all the good work that has been achieved in the North in the past 17 years was not undone. While focusing to some extent on the removal of obstacles, the Fresh Start agreement has ultimately delivered an outcome that not only unblocks progress, but provides a credible roadmap for implementing many aspects of the Stormont House agreement and tackling the continuing impact of paramilitarism. The continuing impact and legacy of paramilitarism was a key issue going into these talks and one that was threatening to destabilise the devolved power sharing institutions. The Fresh Start agreement sets out a plan to end the scourge of paramilitarism and associated criminality. Critically, all parties have agreed to sign up to a set of principles which commit them to achieving a society free of paramilitarism and challenge paramilitary attempts to control communities. In practical terms what this means is the execution of a strategy and action plan to be put in place by the Northern Ireland Executive by June 2016, the aim of which will be to work to disband paramilitary groups and end their destabilising influence on communities. Together with the British Government, the Irish Government will establish a four-member international body that will monitor and report on the progress made towards ending paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland, taking account of the strategy to be agreed and implemented by the Executive. We will also work to enhance and improve cross-Border law enforcement and co-operation, particularly when it comes to tackling organised crime. This will be achieved through a joint agency task force that will be established to tackle these serious issues that are a threat to our communities. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will lead on this and will meet her Northern counterpart and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland next Monday to begin this process and to discuss measures to enhance further cross-Border co-operation. Important progress was also made in the areas of budgetary reforms and financial assistance. The Fresh Start agreement represents a genuinely exciting opportunity.It unblocks several important financial and institutional reforms which are so important for economic stability and will enable the Northern Ireland Executive to deliver more effectively for all the people of Northern Ireland. It will also help the Government and the Executive to co-operate further with the aim of unlocking the full potential of our island economy. The Government has made important financial commitments under the agreement. Contacts with the Northern Ireland Executive are under way with regard to the implementation of these, including the provision of £75 million towards the completion of the first part of the A5 motorway. This project will help unlock the full potential of the north west of the island. The Government has committed a further €2.5 million, which will be matched by the Northern Ireland Executive, for investment in a north-west regional development fund that includes County Donegal. We will continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueway leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal, and remain committed to the concept of the Narrow Water bridge which has the potential to provide jobs and a significant boost to tourism in the surrounding area. The Fresh Start agreement reaffirms the Government’s support for the EU PEACE and INTERREG programmes and its commitment to working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to fully realise the programmes' potential. Almost €500 million will be available from EU sources during the period 2016 to 2021. It also recalls the existing commitments set out in the Government’s capital plan regarding investment in key transport corridors, including the €18 million in funds committed to the ongoing upgrade of the Dublin-Belfast rail corridor and cross-Border co-operation in the areas of flood relief and the energy and communications sectors. The Government will continue to explore capital investment in health projects and services which benefit the Border region. These projects and initiatives have the potential to bring real day-to-day benefits to the people on both sides of the Border. We have committed a total of €110 million under this agreement, much of which will go towards realising the full economic potential of the north west. As the Minister of State with responsibility for North-South co-operation, I am especially pleased with the resumption of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council following re-engagement by DUP Ministers. The North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, plenary meeting, hosted by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Armagh, was held last Friday, 11 December. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, attended the plenary where discussions centred on the recent A Fresh Start agreement and the work to be undertaken by officials to review North-South infrastructure projects. The council also welcomed the commitment in A Fresh Start to tackle paramilitarism, criminality and organised crime and to bring to justice those involved in them. I am glad to report that five North-South Ministerial sectoral meetings have taken place since the re-engagement of the DUP Ministers. It is important that momentum on North-South co-operation is picked up again both within the NSMC and outside of the formal structures, with particular focus on the economy, employment and business development. It was not possible, unfortunately, to address all aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement in the Fresh Start agreement. It is regrettable that A Fresh Start did not address the implementation of the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement dealing with the legacy of the past. I share the disappointment felt by the victims of the Troubles, the survivors and their families. On several occasions I acted as co-chair to the round-table discussions on legacy issues. We were very close to agreement on a range of issues, including the establishment and operation of the historical investigations unit and the independent commission for information retrieval, the setting up of the implementation and reconciliation group on a statutory footing and the detail and operation of the oral history archive. A crucial issue upon which agreement could not be found was in striking the right balance between the disclosure needs of families and the national security requirements sought by the British Government. I stress again, and as the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has said previously, it was not the Irish Government which pressed for an agreement that left aside the legacy of the past. However, when it became clear that the choice was between having an agreement which uncoupled the past or having no agreement at all, the Government agreed most reluctantly to have a less than comprehensive deal which would at least ensure devolved institutions would be protected and placed on a stable and sustainable footing. It is important now to find a way forward that banks the good progress achieved during the talks and secures a solution to outstanding matters. To this end, contacts continue with the British Government, the five main political parties in Northern Ireland and, most important, with various victims’ groups. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met Northern Ireland’s Commissioner for Victims and Survivors on 26 November to discuss the concerns of victims and possible ways to take the issue forward in a way that satisfies these concerns. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, also met the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, David Ford, MLA, last Friday, 11 December 2015, and legacy was a key agenda item. Legacy will also be key in the upcoming meeting of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland before Christmas. The provisions of the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the legacy of the past offer the best possible way of bringing whatever healing is possible to those affected by the Troubles. To achieve this, it is vital these new institutions have the trust and confidence of survivors and their families. Their needs will remain central to the Government’s work in this area. I reiterate the Government’s commitment to working with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government to ensure A Fresh Start is implemented in full. While work will continue on the vital issue of dealing with the legacy of the past, this agreement is a further step forward in Northern Ireland’s journey towards long-term peace and stability. Through the implementation of the agreement, there is an opportunity to demonstrate that power-sharing devolution can provide good government and can offer hope for future generations. I thank committee members for their time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T11:30:00+00:00	I will come back to the Chairman on the petitions of concern, but as I have said, it was not the Irish Government which pressed for an agreement that completely left aside the legacy of the past. The Government was faced with a choice between having an agreement which uncoupled the past or having no agreement at all. With regard to dealing with the legacy, there is a very firm commitment by the Government to ensure we continue the engagement on legacy issues. It will be vital to continue the engagement with victims' groups and their families and high-level political engagement will continue between the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. That engagement will continue apace next week. One could say there is a period of reflection happening now.However, it is important that we acknowledge that a lot of energy was put into dealing with legacy issues during the ten week process. It would not serve the best interests of both communities, north, south, east and west, not to continue the work. It is vital that we continue it but we must find a mechanism and a means that will allow us to do so. The Executive agreed a protocol on the use of the petition of concern that seeks to limit its use. It is voluntary in nature so we will have to see how it will operate within the Assembly. There is perhaps a school of thought that the petition of concern power has been used at sensitive times. The protocol is now in place, however, and the Irish Government hopes the procedure will be used with a positive mindset, if that makes sense.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T11:50:00+00:00	I will endeavour to be as comprehensive as possible. If I miss out on something, I hope members will come back in. Deputy Kitt made a point on legacy. We took the view that we were close to agreement on the operation of the historical investigations unit, including on the provision of guaranteeing its independence and the point that it would be compliant with the Patten principles on policing and justice. Let us go back to what I said originally and factor in Deputy Crowe's point on where the agreement fell. We expressed our preference during the talks for a process that would cover the range of legacy issues on which agreement was possible. The view was that there should be an approach to inculcate a process or speak to the issue of legacy in such a way as not to exclude it from an agreement. The idea was to ensure that we would have a pathway for continuation. In the absence of agreement on the issue we are now in a situation where we stand ready to engage on legacy issues again. The two Governments are seeking a way forward. It is not possible to put an exact timeline on it. We are willing to engage. However, in the case of legacy issues people have to be willing to engage on the basis that there is the prospect of success. I take the point made about what one might term the anachronistic iterative processes that have gone on since 1998 and whether it is possible to provide a way for innovation to allow us to overcome these issues outside of a hothouse arrangement or an intensive process that goes on for ten weeks, but one in which there is no guarantee of success on certain aspects that need to be dealt with for the benefit of this island and our neighbours to the east. There is scope now for some new thinking at political level in terms of how we engage on an ongoing basis rather than within the confined process. We do not always get the outcomes we desire. Deputy O'Reilly made a particular point. Section A of the agreement contains a specific reference to the joint agency task force. The Deputy asked how that is comprised. It will be led by senior officers from Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and HM Revenue and Customs. There is a specific reference to the effect that the task force will report on its work in accordance with the statutory arrangements in place for the law enforcement agencies. In turn, the task force will have a strategic oversight group and an operations co-ordination unit. That much is well laid out. Deputy O'Reilly also asked about economic activity and supports within the Border region. He made reference to the PEACE and INTERREG programmes. I contend that the Government has done a great deal of work with our neighbours to ensure funding will be provided where there is framework for it. A great deal of work was done to get us to the point where we actually agreed on PEACE, for example. That will translate back into the Border region in respect of economic activity. I take the point made on the north-west gateway initiative. The A5 proposal is the key. Deputy Kitt asked about the €110 million allocation. That is the entirety of the package from an Irish Government perspective, so it is inclusive of the north-west gateway initiative. It also includes the other commitments on the A5. No one would disagree with the fact that the north west is a region requiring more in respect of political commitment.There are good initiatives at play there at present, particularly with the two councils on either side of the Border. It is for us at governmental level to try to support that in every way we can. Increasing economic activity is one of the key areas.  Deputy's Crowe spoke about legacy, national security and the approach taken. I think I have answered the question about the approach. If I was to speak personally, I would say that perhaps the approach needs to be looked at again. I do not mean to be ageist, but I am, perhaps, part of a particular generation of politicians. We can name any number of agreements and negotiations, such as the 1998 process or the Weston Park negotiations; it is an iterative process. This generation is as much obliged as the previous one to continue the work on legacy issues, however. We do not want to let another generation pass without ensuring that justice can be found for the victims and their families. That is a fundamental principle which underpins any Irish Government policy on the North, no matter who is in the driving seat. While we stand ready to re-engage on legacy issues, the timing of that engagement remains to be determined. We look forward to co-operating. In my opening remarks I said that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be meeting with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, next week. Part of that conversation will be about continuing to maintain momentum on the need to deal with the issues which Deputy Crowe has articulated in respect of national security and disclosure. I do not think today is the day to open up parts of the negotiations again. We felt that we had made some progress in creating the institutions that were necessary to deal with legacy, such as the implementation and reconciliation group, IRG and the historical investigations unit, HIU. However, during the process of negotiation there was agreement all around that we need to get to a point at which there is at least agreement on the need to restore confidence in the institutions. There was consensus that we would revisit the other aspects and continue to devote energy to them. People have expressed their good wishes and congratulations but I have to say that congratulations are due to Mr. Garvin and Ms McGrath beside me, and to a great team of officials from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Justice and Equality. Incidentally, that Department will take the lead in the interaction on the task force issues. It is a team approach and the work will continue between sets of negotiations. I reassure the committee that it is a constant process. There was a specific question about flood relief and energy. Those issues are dealt with in the sectoral elements and in the ongoing work at ministerial level. As I said at the outset, we have seen a new energy about ensuring that the agenda on ongoing North-South issues, such as flooding and flood relief, is dealt with through sectoral engagements.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T12:10:00+00:00	Has the Senator ever driven through the Dunkettle roundabout?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T12:20:00+00:00	It is in my parish.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T12:30:00+00:00	I would like, first, to thank Dr. Alasdair McDonnell for his good wishes in that sense. We should note the contribution he made as a negotiator on behalf of his party; he was at the table as well. A great deal of work was done by all parties in respect of the contributions to this agreement. I am just one person. Along with the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, I represented the Irish Government at the talks. However, talks are only as good as the people who contribute to them. Significant contributions were made by those on all sides. I take this opportunity, in a personal capacity, to thank Dr. Alasdair McDonnell for his role and also for the contribution he made, as the former leader of his party, when the talks were ongoing. The word "blanket" was used and Mr. Brady referred to the cover of the blanket during the past 40 years. With respect to the generational element, there is as much of a responsibility on politicians of my generation as there is on those who go before us to ensure that the legacy issues are not forgotten. We need to continue to press the British Government on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Pat Finucane case and the relatives groups. In the context of the issue of disclosure and national security, we need to ensure that some mechanism is found to deal with the outstanding historical issues. If society is to heal itself and if we are talking about the restoration of normative politics, in my humble opinion, there will not be a move on that restoration until such time as those issues are dealt with. That is a view that informs the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice and Equality in their everyday work. In the context of the team of people from the Department of Foreign Affairs who work with the victims and families and at political level in Northern Ireland - quietly and underneath the radar - in terms of trying to progress this agenda on a constant basis, it is fair to say that successive Irish Governments have sought to lean heavily on the British Government with regard to very specific cases and in respect of the principle that if society is to heal itself, it cannot do so unless the legacy issues are dealt with. I would contend that much progress was made last year on devising a process for dealing with the legacy issues and in regard to the potential for setting up institutional changes that would deal with that. We will continue to work on that matter. When the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, meets the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, next week, the legacy issues will continue to be discussed and they will continue to be live issues. I take the point that was made by Deputy Smith on the issue of the timelines and the electoral cycle. The work continues regardless of the electoral cycle. Whether it is possible to begin a process again early in the new year remains to be seen but, as I said at the outset, the Irish Government stands ready to engage. If there is a process that is to be started again in regard to dealing with these issues, we stand ready. There is no doubt but that we stand ready to deal with the legacy issues.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2015-12-17T12:30:00+00:00	We will continue the engagement with the Secretary of State. We have a soon to be appointed First Minister, if that person has not been ratified already and there is a Deputy First Minister. With respect to the negotiations, we felt strongly that we had made progress on the legacy issues. If the parties within the Executive feel that there is an urgency about dealing with these matters in the next number of weeks, the Irish Government stands ready to engage with the parties on it. With respect to Senator Jim D'Arcy's points on justice issues, a meeting between the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and Mr. David Forde took place on 11 December and another meeting will take place next week. If one notes the strategic oversight group, a distinction can be made between setting up an agency and setting up a task force. In the context of establishing a task force and doing so correctly, I would refer to a strategic oversight group which is inherent within the task force and an operations co-ordination group. I will quote directly from the document, which states, "representatives from the relevant law enforcement agencies at senior management level) that will identify strategic priorities for combating cross-jurisdictional organised crime". There is the day-to-day work that continues with respect to the cross-Border crime effort. This will allow for a flexible and reflexive response at the same time and it would be possible to do that in a co-ordinated way. There will be six-monthly ministerial meetings to ensure that this work is given the energy that it absolutely deserves. I note the points in the agreement about Narrow Water bridge, the points about the symbolism of the road going both ways, as was said, in regard to the potential for tourism. I note also the points that are made in it on the issue of funding for tourism in context of the PEACE or INTERREG programmes. I further note the point that is made about the wording in regard to strengthening it and putting a budget line behind it, and that is something we will take away from this. With regard to the point on the petition of concern and having an opposition, we have an appreciation of the various strands that exist under the Good Friday Agreement. There is an appreciation in this committee of the area of competences. In the context of Mr. McCallister's Bill, I would say that if one views it from one perspective, it is a very positive contribution to the restoration of normative politics in Northern Ireland. However, as a Member of the Dáil, and observing it from that vantage point, I would say, without seeking to kick to touch, that this would still be a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. We would not go into the proposals in the Bill from a Government point of view but it is a positive step forward in terms of the contribution it will make towards the restoration of normative politics. I am not saying that politics there is abnormal in any sense, I am just saying that we operate in a particular way within this House. As parliamentarians, the concept of opposition and government is completely inherent to how we do business. I would imagine that any moves towards that would be welcomed but there is still an Executive and we acknowledge that as well. I hope I have answered all of the questions that were put to me and if I have not, I would be happy to come back in again. I want to record my appreciation of the thanks people have offered us. I will convey that to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and our team in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I thank the Chairman and members for the time they have afforded us.
