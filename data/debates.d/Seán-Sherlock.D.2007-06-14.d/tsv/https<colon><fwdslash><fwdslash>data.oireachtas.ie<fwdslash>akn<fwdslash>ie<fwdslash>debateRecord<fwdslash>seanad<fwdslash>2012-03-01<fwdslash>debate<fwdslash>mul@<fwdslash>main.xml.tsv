[<p eid="para_222">I thank the Senators for tabling the amendment.  I appreciate their concerns about the intention to have the Bill apply retrospectively from 5 December 2011, the transposition date of the directive.  On Second Stage earlier this week the Minister indicated that he was in receipt of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the legislation should, on enactment, have retrospective effect from 5 December 2011, with the notable exception of the offence creating provisions in sections 13 and 15 in Part 4 of the Bill.  These provisions will come into effect on enactment of the legislation.  My advice is based on the fact that implementation of the directive provisions is necessitated to meet the obligations arising from membership of the European Union and that, therefore, they enjoy protection under the Constitution.</p>]
[<p eid="para_271">One must have regard to the points that were made by those such as Senators Quinn and Mary Ann O'Brien in terms of their experience as business people and given Senator Quinn's long-standing membership of this House as a legislator.  One has to have due regard and respect for that and for everything he says.</p>, <p eid="para_272">If we strip out all of the rhetoric, the verbose language and the accusations, which I appreciate given such language occurs in the normal course of political dialogue, the key point is that this is about the implementation of a directive.</p>]
[<p eid="para_275">I will not be dragged into a debate on the last Government's performance and its relationship with the European Union——</p>]
[<p eid="para_277">——or the nature of our own relationship with the European Union.  I happen to believe we are a member of the European Union — that is factual.  As such, we have signed up to a process of consultation through co-decision procedures and interaction with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  When the Commission makes a legislative proposal, if there is a co-decision procedure to be adhered to, then we, as a member of the EU, are party to that consultation process.  When an agreement is reached, primarily on the basis of consensus, we then transpose the directives.  In this case, the directive dates back to 2008; therefore, we have to transpose it.  If we all agree to the fact we are a member of the EU, then we subscribe to those founding principles and the legislative actions arising thereof and to which we are party.</p>, <p eid="para_278">To take the points made by Mr. Jim Power, he was extrapolating from a UK figure.  While the Senator states he has no grá for Mr. Power, I happen to think Mr. Power is provocative and one who has provoked debate in a very positive sense in this country around issues such as agriculture, for example——</p>]
[<p eid="para_280">——and in regard to the nature of employment.  He has provoked good debate, which is what we need in this country.  However, there is no evidence to date that in the UK job losses have occurred as a result of the same directive that must be transposed into UK law.</p>, <p eid="para_281">I am not aware of any evidence on the record of this House or the Dáil in respect of utterances by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in regard to job losses.  With the indulgence of the House, I will quote again from his speech:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_282">The final derogation available under Article 5.4 of the directive recognises the voluntarist nature of industrial relations in the United Kingdom and in Ireland and was designed to meet the needs and flexibilities required in the labour market to accommodate the system in place in both countries.  The derogation includes the possibility for a "qualifying period" before the principle of equal treatment would apply to temporary agency workers.</p>, <p eid="para_283">To be fair to the Minister, what we are trying to do here is to protect the rights of workers, to comply with the EU directive and to do so in a way that is balanced.  If there is a contention that job losses will occur directly in one specific company or entity as a result of this, I respectfully suggest I have my doubts.  The evidence in terms of inward investment into Ireland by global companies, which have public affairs departments and are <i>au fait</i> through those departments with trends in EU legislation and transposition of EU directives, is that they are aware this legislation is on the cards and would have regard to that fact when they are making their investment decisions in Ireland.  We have had some notable investment decisions and notable companies setting up here, some of whose operations would be within the sphere of employing temporary agency workers or contract workers.</p>, <p eid="para_284">I have not seen any evidence of job losses in the UK and do not know of any public utterance by the Minister to this or the other House in respect of prospective job losses.  If somebody has done a study or has extrapolated from UK figures, it should be put on the record or submitted to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.</p>]
[<p eid="para_346">The proposed amendment which has been ruled out of order seeks to move beyond the scope of the requirements contained in the directive.  The directive seeks only to set a floor of entitlements in respect of basic working and employment conditions.  Article 3.2 allows member states, in their national law, to determine the definition of pay, as well as other elements.  Under Article 5.4, member states are asked to specify whether elements such as pensions, sick pay, etc., are included in basic working and employment conditions.  Given the scope of the directive, this extends only to basic working and employment conditions.  It is not the Government's intention to move beyond either the spirit or intent of the directive, particularly at a time when we face such challenges in the labour market.</p>, <p eid="para_347">I may be obliged to defer to the officials on Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_349">Perhaps I might deal with it later then.</p>]
[<p eid="para_352">Yes, I will be obliged to do so.</p>]
[<p eid="para_372">I will begin with the last point.  If the lights are flashing amber or red in Columbus, Ohio, and the company to which the Senator referred is IDA Ireland supported or other State agencies have been actively involved with it, I suggest the State agencies talk to representatives of the company.  The Senator should approach the State agencies to discuss potential difficulties the company may have.  Successive Governments have always taken a hands-on approach and intervened through the State agencies to try to assist individual companies.</p>, <p eid="para_373">On Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's earlier point, where there is no comparable employee, the rate paid should be that which would be paid to a comparable direct employee.  If such were to employed, the rate would have regard to skills, qualifications and length of service under sections 3 and 7(3), which sets the clock to 5 December 2011 and allows the hirer to base the rate on the rates that applied on that date.  I hope that addresses the point raised by the Senator.</p>, <p eid="para_374">I thank Senators for their amendments.  The Government understands the various circumstances Senators are trying to guard against with the amendments.  Amendment No. 4 seeks to amend the definition of "comparable employee" as contained in section 3.  Amendment No. 5 seeks to avert any attempt by agency workers to select the most advantageous possible comparable employee in a scenario where there may be more than one possible comparator in a hirer undertaking.  Amendment No. 8 seeks the ability for the hirer undertaking to designate one person as the comparable employee against which the agency worker would be measured for the purposes of equal treatment.  In the context of ministerial amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil, the legislation already caters for the circumstance Senators are seeking to address.  In this connection, sections 3 and 7 must be read together.  The criteria in section 3 require that the employer of the agency worker and employee must be the same, the agency worker and employee must work at the same place and the work undertaken must be the same or similar in nature and be carried out under the same or similar conditions.</p>, <p eid="para_375">Section 2 provides a further safeguard to avoid the selection of the most advantageous possible comparator, where it is a relevant factor, in the recruitment of direct employees, by providing that skills, qualifications and length of service are reckonable factors that a hirer can take into account.  These provisions all address in an appropriate manner the concerns of hirers and allow them to develop a robust defence in terms of the relevance or otherwise of the comparator selected.</p>, <p eid="para_376">While I understand the concerns raised on the issue of the possible selection of inappropriate comparators, it is the case that there are instances, even in the civil and public service, where new entrants are taken on on less favourable terms and conditions than those that applied previously.  In this case, it is difficult to see how a successful challenge could be mounted by an agency worker in favour of the application of terms and conditions that applied previously.  For instance, new terms and conditions now apply to new recruits to the teaching and nursing professions, which would, therefore, be a logical benchmark for new agency workers being taken on.  It is inconceivable that a claim for equal treatment would succeed on the basis that an agency worker could claim that the previous terms and conditions of direct recruits should apply to him or her.  The Bill provides this certainty in so far as it can without unduly prejudicing the position of agency workers.</p>, <p eid="para_377">On the basis that they are already catered for, a view supported by the Parliamentary Counsel, while I thank the Senators, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_407">With respect, I am happy to take all views and then respond finally to the amendment, if that is okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_410">There have been a number of points.  I suppose now would be a bad time to say I am a big fan of Neuhaus Belgian chocolates.  I would say "Fair play and well done" to anybody with an Irish company trying to penetrate the Belgian market.  If the Senator is getting a foothold in that market, I applaud her.</p>]
[<p eid="para_412">That is fantastic.  In fairness, one must applaud the business model used by two of the Senators present and the fact that the two businesses compete at a world class level.  I am acknowledging this without plámás.  I lived in Belgium for three years and I always thought Cadbury's was the only chocolate product until I moved to Belgium.  We can now appreciate where we are with the wonderful product ranges and the high quality of those products.</p>, <p eid="para_413">Collective agreements are addressed in section 8 and the possibility is allowed for in that section of concluding local and enterprise level agreements.  The fundamental point of the legislation concerns transposition of a directive and protection of workers' rights.  The question is what a person should be paid now.  There is no question of referring or reverting to old pay rates.  This does not arise.  Where does the Bill mention reverting to old pay rates?</p>]
[<p eid="para_415">The clock started on 5 December last.</p>]
[<p eid="para_417">Let us be straight about it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_426">One must always have regard to what is said in the Seanad on legislation.  I accept the points made about trying to revisit the issues involved before Report Stage.  However, there was a consultation process on the legislation dating back to 2010; therefore, it is not a case of the Government trying to ram it through.  The consultation process involved the social partners and, in fairness, the Minister took all views on board.  However, we are working within the limitations of the directive which was agreed at EU level by all member states.  It is arguable that no further consultation is required because there has been full engagement.</p>, <p eid="para_427">With regard to measuring the potential job losses, Senator Jim Walsh, with all due respect, is a member of Fianna Fáil which was in power for the past decade.  To ask a Minister whether there will or will not be job losses and quantify the rate at which job losses will occur is a little like asking how long is a piece of string.  We do not know.</p>, <p eid="para_428">I accept the point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien about the derogation period in the United Kingdom.  It has only been in place for the last three months, but as of today there is no evidence of job losses.  There might be some, but that is not based on information to me from the State agencies or stakeholders such as IBEC and others.  One cannot measure exactly whether there will be job losses or whether there will be no change to employment structures as a consequence of this legislation.  Bear in mind that its purpose is implementation of the directive and that we have obligations in terms of adherence to EU law.</p>, <p eid="para_429">With regard to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, the requirement in the directive is that agency workers enjoy at least the same basic and working conditions that they would enjoy if they had been directly recruited by the hirer to do the same job.  Section 7 aims to remain faithful, as we are bound to be, to the wording of the directive and, therefore, provides for two separate and distinct possibilities.  The first, in section 7(1)(<i>a</i>), provides for a situation where there is already in existence a comparable employee.  In this instance, close regard must be had also to section 3 which defines the criteria for establishing a comparable employee.  The criteria set down are very specific and cumulative and, in that sense, do not allow a broad interpretation to be make of a comparable employee.</p>, <p eid="para_430">Separately, section 7(1)(<i>b</i>) provides for instances where there is no comparable employee, in which case the terms and conditions applicable will be the same as those to which a comparable employee would, if directly employed, be entitled.  This is compliant with the directive requirement.  It is not possible to move beyond this, as the amendments seek to do, and introduce conditionality, effectively a watering down of the provisions, as proposed, because we would run the risk of falling foul of the directive requirements.  As in the case of section 7(1)(<i>a</i>), this provision must be read in conjunction with section 3.</p>, <p eid="para_431">A further amendment brought forward to assist with legal certainty on the issue is that contained in section 7(3) which provides that in respect of agency workers on assignment prior to 5 December 2011, although the assignment may end after that date, the effective date for the purpose of establishing equal treatment is 5 December 2011.  The Parliamentary Counsel has advised that the directive wording does not facilitate the inclusion of the conditionality proposed in the text of the Bill.  In this regard, we have travelled as far as we can legally with the safeguards contained in sections 3 and 7(3) which are designed to assist in the proper implementation of the provision.</p>, <p eid="para_432">In the proposed amendment to section 7(2) Senator Mary Ann O'Brien is, in effect, proposing a deeming provision to certify that an employer would be deemed to have conferred the entitlements of equal treatment on an agency worker where it was demonstrated that these were at least the same as those applicable to a comparable employee.  While understanding the rationale for the amendment, I am advised that such a provision is extraneous and not necessary.  In instances where there are comparable employees alongside agency workers it will in practice be the case that employers will seek to demonstrate that equal treatment between agency workers and comparable employees applies.  This will be useful in providing evidential proof.</p>]
[<p eid="para_437">It is a matter for the Senator if he wishes to call a vote on his amendment.  With regard to the consultation process, people were sent letters.  It involved the usual stakeholders such as IBEC.</p>]
[<p eid="para_439">No.  We can provide the Senator with a list.</p>]
[<p eid="para_441">We can provide a list.  The Minister met the National Recruitment Federation, individual recruitment agencies, IDA Ireland, IBEC and the ICTU.  There was an extensive consultation process on the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_444">No.</p>]
[<p eid="para_452">While I understand the rationale behind this amendment, it would not, even if accepted, have any material effect and is redundant.  It is already the case under the employment legislation that a contract of indefinite duration can be terminated for reasons such as redundancy, liquidation of the employer and so on.  Under the provisions of the existing law, this Bill does not discommode existing law in this context.</p>]
[<p eid="para_454">I am certain there is no prescriptive measure laid down, such as, for example, that employees must be a member of a trade union, by which they can consult under the provisions of section 8.</p>]
[<p eid="para_455">This is a technical amendment which seeks to ensure that for the purposes only of equal treatment of working and employment conditions for agency workers that are part-time employees, it is the provisions of this legislation and not that of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 that applies.  In effect, this means that whereas in that Act, the appropriate comparator that is established for an agency worker is another agency worker, that is superseded by this legislation, which takes as the appropriate comparator another directly recruited employee, subject to the criteria of section 3.</p>]
[<p eid="para_468">I understand the rationale behind these amendments.  The provision as it stands, however, lists the facilities and amenities intended.  While the list is not exhaustive, it is not intended that collective facilities and amenities would include remuneration or expenses.  There is a danger in introducing one proposed exclusion as to do so would raise other issues that could be equally proposed for exclusion.  This type of detail is more appropriate for inclusion in guidance documentation on the Bill in preparation in my Department.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 14.</p>, <p eid="para_469">On amendment No. 15, it is not suggested in the legislation nor would it be legally possible under the Bill that an agency worker could contend that there is any employment relationship between the hirer and the worker on the basis that the latter now has an entitlement to use any collective facilities in the same manner as direct employees.  The definitions make clear there is a three way relationship and the employer of the agency worker is the employment agency.  In that sense, the amendment is unnecessary.</p>]
[<p eid="para_476">Amendment No. 15 can be addressed in the context of the guidance documentation provided with the Bill.  On the other points regarding the august body of employment legislation and the system of joint labour committees and registered employment agreements, it is a surreal experience to hear a Fianna Fáil Party Senator——</p>]
[<p eid="para_480">——whose former leader, the great Seán Lemass, was the architect of some of the joint labour committees and registered employment agreements.</p>]
[<p eid="para_482">Senators will forgive me if I sound a little confused.  We should not dismantle or raze to the ground the employment protections in place for workers on the basis of the current economic climate.  We must strike a balance, which is what we seek to do in the legislation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_484">To be fair, the Government is doing its best to create employment and the conditions for employment.  While I note the points made by Senators, I respectfully suggest they should be made on the basis of the amendment under discussion.  If someone starts speaking about dismantling the joint labour committee architecture, that is another issue.  For the purposes of the discussion of this amendment——</p>]
[<p eid="para_486">On amendment No. 15, the guidance document could clarify the matters raised by Senator Walsh.</p>]
[<p eid="para_488">With due respect, I have made known my views.</p>]
[<p eid="para_490">That is one of the most patronising comments I have heard in a long time.  I am a Labour Party Minister of State who shares my Department with a senior colleague from the Fine Gael Party.  We are completely <i>ad idem</i> on this issue.  I am not here to do my master’s bidding.  An agreement has been reached as to how these issues are transposed.</p>]
