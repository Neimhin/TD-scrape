[<p eid="para_29">We want to include the marketing function.  The 1999 amending Act amended the 1980 Act and made angling and marketing promotion a central function of the Central Fisheries Board.  Likewise, the same Act amended section 11 of the 1980 Act for angling and promotional marketing.  In the Inland Fisheries Ireland Bill, however, marketing and promotion are watered down and there is no mention at all of marketing in section 7.</p>, <p eid="para_30">Also, in section 7(8), an inference can be made that IFI could focus on protection and conservation of wildlife with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Fish are a natural resource and can bring income into the State and it is important to recognise that.</p>]

We wish to strengthen the wording, with "after consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee".  It broadens the remit and fleshes out the provisions on the forum and ensures the Oireachtas will be consulted.  It could be argued that there is no real provision for regional input by stakeholders.  There could be a massive void when the fisheries boards cease to exist.  That is the basis of the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_55">In light of the Minister of State's response, I will be happy to examine this again on Report Stage.  I will withdraw my amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_57">It is a question of recognising the role of the various stakeholders in the regions and finding some formula for them to have a voice.  This is the primary aim of the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">In support of the amendment, I take the view that if what we are talking about here is a natural resource, then we need to hold the research up to public scrutiny.  If that means it is contested, so be it.  That is the nature of research, whether social or scientific.  Research should be contestable and held up to public scrutiny.  I support the amendment on that basis.</p>]
[<p eid="para_177">The provision states the Minister may "specify by order alternative means".  That wording is too vague.  It would be helpful if there were a more qualitative interpretation of what it means on Report Stage.</p>]

Again, this probably addresses a similar theme to the previous amendment.</p>]
