SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	We want to include the marketing function.  The 1999 amending Act amended the 1980 Act and made angling and marketing promotion a central function of the Central Fisheries Board.  Likewise, the same Act amended section 11 of the 1980 Act for angling and promotional marketing.  In the Inland Fisheries Ireland Bill, however, marketing and promotion are watered down and there is no mention at all of marketing in section 7.Also, in section 7(8), an inference can be made that IFI could focus on protection and conservation of wildlife with the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Fish are a natural resource and can bring income into the State and it is important to recognise that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 11, subsection (2)(a), line 41, after “management,” to insert “marketing,”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 13, subsection (4), line 5, after "Minister" to insert the following:", after consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee, in order to ensure a broadly based representation of relevant stakeholders in advising on policy to be pursued by IFI with regional sub-fora".The Bill states that IFI shall establish and manage a forum.  We wish to strengthen the wording, with "after consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee".  It broadens the remit and fleshes out the provisions on the forum and ensures the Oireachtas will be consulted.  It could be argued that there is no real provision for regional input by stakeholders.  There could be a massive void when the fisheries boards cease to exist.  That is the basis of the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In light of the Minister of State's response, I will be happy to examine this again on Report Stage.  I will withdraw my amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	It is a question of recognising the role of the various stakeholders in the regions and finding some formula for them to have a voice.  This is the primary aim of the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In support of the amendment, I take the view that if what we are talking about here is a natural resource, then we need to hold the research up to public scrutiny.  If that means it is contested, so be it.  That is the nature of research, whether social or scientific.  Research should be contestable and held up to public scrutiny.  I support the amendment on that basis.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The provision states the Minister may "specify by order alternative means".  That wording is too vague.  It would be helpful if there were a more qualitative interpretation of what it means on Report Stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 16, subsection (1)(e), line 10, after “nomination” to insert the following:"being 1 representative of anglers and 1 representative of the commercial sector".Section 12(1) states:IFI shall consist of 9 members appointed by the Minister of whom—(a) one shall be appointed by the Minister as Chairperson,(b) in accordance with subsection (3), 3 shall be appointed by the Minister,(c) one shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government,(d) one shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs,(e) 2 shall be appointed on the Minister’s own nomination, andThis is top heavy with ministerial appointments.  This amendment would ensure both anglers and the commercial sector are represented on the board.  It would also ensure against cronyism and that relevant people from the industry would be appointed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I would never accuse the Minister of State of cronyism or appointing one of his pals.  I accept the assurances he has given in that context and withdraw the amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 16, subsection (3)(b), line 24, after “persons” to insert “proposed to be”.Under the Bill as it stands, the Oireachtas committee only suggests three names.  All the other board members are notified to the committee after they are appointed, and this is a fait accompli, in effect.  We suggest that all the members be notified to the committee in advance, so that it may nominate three and comment on the rest.This addresses the idea that there should not be complete and utter ministerial control of appointments and that the Oireachtas committee should be given a real say in terms of how the board is constituted, thus recognising the validity of the committee in making an appointment to the board.  Again, this probably addresses a similar theme to the previous amendment.
