[<p eid="para_1270">I refer to the Minister's speech where he said that recent CSO data shows that 44% of cross-Border shoppers buy alcohol.  This assumes that 56% do not buy alcohol and it presupposes that some people's motivation for going across the Border is primarily to buy alcohol.  I do not think it warrants the measure produced here.  There are other ways of tackling the tide or stemming the flow across the Border.</p>, <p eid="para_1271">As my colleagues have also mentioned, regarding the cuts in public sector pay, 5% on a salary of €35,000, will reduce the salary by €1,500.  How in the name of God will that kind of a reduction allow anybody——</p>]
[<p eid="para_1273">——with a mortgage and children to be able to live any kind of a decent life in this country?  Is this what this Republic has been reduced to?  It is an absolute shame.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1676">It is a bit surreal to see——</p>]
[<p eid="para_1679">——Fianna Fáil so silent on this matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1690">I refer to the effect the carbon tax will have on a public sector employee earning €30,000 a year whose income will be reduced by €1,500.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1692">The effect of the carbon tax on vulnerable, low paid people will be more pronounced as a result of the cuts that have been effected.  We want the Government to do something in real terms for them.  The budget is predicated on reducing the incomes of the low paid.  The introduction of the carbon tax without mitigating its effect on those on low incomes is inequitable.  I would like the Minister to address this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1694">This has to be addressed in concrete terms, not in nebulous or airy-fairy terms.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1696">This is about real people whose incomes are minuscule and the Minister is further marginalising them and cutting them off through imposition of these taxes.  The Green Party Ministers do not realise it because they are on another planet.  They do not inhabit the real world.  There are people in the real world outside these walls who have been put to the pin of their collar by Ministers who are off saving the planet.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1698">They should have a reality check.  We do not oppose the carbon tax but we do not want people on low incomes to be screwed to the wall.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1872">What about the poor?</p>]
