SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:20:00+01:00	I join in welcoming Mr. Regan to the committee today. We have heard of a number of tremendous and positive initiatives. It is good to have crystallisation of what the GAA is doing right down to the local community, because sometimes we think of the GAA in binary terms, whether hurling or football, camogie or handball and so on. Often, we think of the GAA in binary terms and in an intercounty context only. As policymakers we might not fully appreciate what happens across the land except perhaps through the prism of our individual clubs. Given that we are good parochial people, I am keen to hear more about the fun and run activity. My club in Mallow, County Cork, has world-class facilities. We have a multimillion euro facility. It is something that could be used as a hub for the Munster region for outworking in that regard. I would be delighted to work with the GAA on this. We should not simply look at the facility in terms of Mallow but from the Munster or regional perspective given its specific location. Perhaps I will share more with Mr. Regan on that afterwards. We cannot underestimate the metrics Mr. Regan has given us today. The key metric is the top-line metric, which is a total of 142,467 participants in the CÃºl Camps. It is the biggest child sport promotion in the world. That is a phenomenal metric for what is an indigenous sport when we look at it in global terms. We should be shouting that metric from the rooftops. It is testament to the lateral thinking that now exists within the GAA. The GAA sees itself as having a clear social function. The association sees itself as having responsibilities to its community right down to the neighbourhood. Committee members are delighted to hear the metric in the context of our deliberations on tackling obesity. Does Mr. Regan believe more needs to be done in outreach to primary schools? Are some primary schools not being reached? Is the ability to get in the front door hampered for certain reasons? If so, what are the reasons?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:20:00+01:00	Excellent.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:20:00+01:00	I have another question on primary schools and how to reach a penetration rate of 100%. Mr. Regan stated that the GAA is willing to reach out into other areas. He referred to the principle of getting basic movements, how the GAA does not claim ownership of this, and how the association is willing to work with others. The committee will have to make recommendations. If Mr. Regan were to make recommendations, is there anything he would recommend by way of an action to try to reach a 100% penetration rate for every school so that every child in the country could hit that target?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:30:00+01:00	My last question is more of a shout-out for handball.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:30:00+01:00	It is a minority sport.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:30:00+01:00	We have produced world champions in handball in my great town of Mallow and have invested heavily, through sports capital funding, in retrofitting our club. I would always put my hand up for having handball. The GAA, from a global perspective, should consider that sport. It is developing slowly but it could develop quickly if it was given a global platform. I would welcome if handball could be translated into the work Mr. Regan is doing and be considered in some of these initiatives, particularly with respect to catching, throwing, forward movement and so on.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:30:00+01:00	Indeed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:30:00+01:00	Exactly. I put my hand up for handball. I thank Mr. Regan. This has been a wonderful contribution to our discourse on obesity.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-06-13T10:50:00+01:00	I must give Mr. Regan my apologies. I have to go because I have to ask a question of the Minister now. Could I get Mr. Regan's contact details before we finish?
