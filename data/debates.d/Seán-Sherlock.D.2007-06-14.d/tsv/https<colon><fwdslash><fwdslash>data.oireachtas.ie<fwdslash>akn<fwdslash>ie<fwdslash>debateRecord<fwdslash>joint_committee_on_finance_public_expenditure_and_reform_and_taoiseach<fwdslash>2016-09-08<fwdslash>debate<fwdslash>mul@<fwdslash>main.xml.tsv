The Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, was before the committee yesterday and I am sure the witnesses have read some of the transcripts. He said "the ability of the Government to influence insurance pricing is limited, as insurance companies are required by European law to price in accordance with risk". It is worth our while interrogating further the setting of the discount rate. The rate may be 2% or 3% but the insurance premiums have increased by multiples of that. I assume that is because of provisioning. It would be useful for people watching online if Mr. Faughnan could give them a better appreciation as to why there has been a loading on insurance premiums this year. I am fascinated by the fact that he says insurance companies are narrowing their footprint and cherry-picking customers. Mr. Moran has said that there has been no increase in the risk related to old drivers but they are being told when the go to renew their premiums that they carry a greater risk. I imagine the market is still lucrative so I do not see why they are narrowing their footprint. I imagine the risk is still covered to a large extent. Is it because the underwriters, of which globally there are a limited number working in the motor insurance sector, are deciding the Irish market is not lucrative enough? Are they saying that profit is the ultimate motive over and above that of risk? I would like a deeper understanding of why the witness feels there will be a further rise of 20% over the next two or three quarters. Are the witnesses interacting with the Minister of State's working group? I get a sense from the Minister of State's intervention yesterday that while there have been meetings, the insurance industry is not really a stakeholder in the process but merely a contributor. The firms give information but are not influencing a potential outcome which would see the necessary reductions in premiums, as called for by Mr. Griffin, especially in the case of younger drivers and older drivers. We all have experience of this issue from our work in our constituencies, whether they be rural or urban. As public representatives, we have seen a massive increase in the cost of premiums. When we see increases of between 33% and 50% in the cost of premiums, we wonder if it is based on the profit motive or something else. Is it only about the book of quantum or the automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, or the discount rate? It seems to me there is something more to it than that. Is there another explanation of the discount rate?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	There is-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	There is a legislative provision to do that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	In other words, we in the Oireachtas could influence that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	If Mr. Faughnan is saying that historically premiums were reducing to a critical point where they were not able to cover the costs-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	-----what is the natural correction? Is there an assessment of a figure of a natural correction because the assumption here is that we will accept a correction-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	-----but it seems there is a loading on that correction which is now moving it into the supernormal profits, if I can incorrectly use that term. In other words, if somebody had paid a premium of €500, for example, and this year it is €800, of the €300 extra, what is the correction and what is absolute supernormal profits? That is why if one speaks to Mr. Kian Griffin's constituency and to older people they are absolutely perplexed. We are all perplexed as to why we are paying so much extra for our premiums overnight. It seems to me that not all the factors that Mr. Faughnan talks about here are contributing factors but that there is a profit loading on that as well. For instance, AA has three underwriters.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	Obviously, it is in a pretty secure position because it has three underwriters. Perhaps that is the norm; I do not know. It seems to me that the underwriters, which are big international houses, are influencing the market in little Ireland because it is a small market in global terms. We should interrogate that further because I think Mr. Faughnan is saying that there is hope in terms of some legislative changes and data sharing, which is the European norm. If we can get those things right within this committee and within the Houses, we will go some way to ameliorating the situation but the profit element is something we need transparency on.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2016-09-08T11:40:00+01:00	That is why the working group, with political support on a cross-party basis and working proactively with all of the stakeholders, has the potential to get to the nub of this problem.
