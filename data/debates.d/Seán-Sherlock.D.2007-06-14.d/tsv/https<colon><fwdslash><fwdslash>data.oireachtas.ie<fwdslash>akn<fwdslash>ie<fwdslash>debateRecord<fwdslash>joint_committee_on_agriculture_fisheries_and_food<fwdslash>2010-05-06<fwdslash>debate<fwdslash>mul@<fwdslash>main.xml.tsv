[<p eid="para_117">I wish to speak on the issue of advertising and the Ombudsman's conclusions in this regard.  First, I ask Deputy Fahey to address conclusion No. 2 of the Ombudsman's report, on page 81, which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_118">The way the Lost at Sea Scheme was designed was contrary to fair and sound administration.  The specific weaknesses in the design process included, lack of adequate research, lack of thorough documented analysis of the pros and cons of the various criteria and a failure to include provision for discretion in the vetting of applications.</p>, <p eid="para_119">In Deputy Fahey's own submission, he quoted from a letter dated 3 July 2008 to the Ombudsman from Mr. Tom Moran in which it was stated: "The objective and purpose of the scheme was clear, transparent and unambiguous".</p>, <p eid="para_120">The Deputy went on to say:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_121">That is the reason the scheme was advertised only in the marine press and the fishing organisations were consulted and informed of the scheme.  The Byrne family had not been involved in fishing since the tragic accident in the early 1980s, so they would not have qualified for the scheme even if their application had been made in time.</p>, <p eid="para_122">They would not have qualified for the scheme, therefore, even if their application had been made on time.  My question goes back to page 81 where the Ombudsman says the advertising was inadequate.  In conclusion No. 3 she states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_123">Given that this was a finite, once-off Scheme, aimed at a specific class of individuals the Scheme was not advertised adequately. The advertising process should have been more thorough, comprehensive and targeted. In addition some prospective applicants were put in a more advantageous position than others as they were written to directly by the Department and the Minister to inform them about the Scheme...</p>, <p eid="para_124">I have always approached the specific reference to advertising in the report on the basis that, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the Byrne family would not reasonably have been in a position because of the tragic circumstances to read the marine press in the intervening years.  Deputy Fahey stated the scheme was properly advertised but I cannot tally how he can justifiably say it was adequately advertised when, at the same time, it is stated some people were put in an advantageous position as a result of the scheme.  On the one hand, he is arguing it was advertised adequately and that all comers who may have benefitted from the scheme could have benefitted from it but, at the same time, some people were put in a more advantageous position because as the then Minister he wrote to specific persons outlining the prospective launch of the scheme.</p>, <p eid="para_125">The Ombudsman also stated:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_126">With regard to finding number 3 the former Minister, in responding to the Draft Investigation Report, objected, <i>inter alia</i>, to the suggestion that he was responsible for the advertising campaign. He said that this was a matter for the civil servants in the Department. Having said that, he also expressed the view that the advertising campaign was reasonable and satisfactory.</p>, <p eid="para_127">Perhaps this is an incongruous issue but I would like this cleared up.  From a layman's perspective, if I made a complaint to the Ombudsman and I looked at this objectively, I would have seen that the Minister of the day informed certain persons prior to the launch of the scheme and if I was a complainant, I could have argued that the scheme was not adequately advertised at the time because if I did not read the marine press, there was no way a prospective complainant would have known about the scheme.  I would, therefore, have been put at a disadvantage.  The Ombudsman's conclusions are unambiguous in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_128">What is Deputy Fahey's response to her conclusion that the scheme was "contrary to fair and sound administration"?  Some people were potentially put in an advantageous position.  Paragraph 5.17 states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_129">...A table was attached giving details of 16 owners who had requested replacement capacity, about whom the Division was aware and also giving details about their vessels. Draft letters were also attached for the Minister's signature to issue to Mr Paddy Mullen and Mr Tony Faherty informing them about the launch of the Scheme. A closing date of 31 December 2001 was set down for the Scheme...</p>, <p eid="para_130">Deputy Fahey needs to respond on this.</p>]
[<p eid="para_132">Is that letter in the report?</p>]
[<p eid="para_148">I am a layman, not a lawyer, but the English language is something I like to think I can interpret fairly well.  To return to the conclusions, conclusion No. 2 of the Ombudsman's report was that the way the lost at sea scheme was designed was contrary to fair and sound administration.  To my mind, that is to say it was not designed in a way that was fair to anyone applying to the scheme.</p>, <p eid="para_149">I asked a specific question on the advertising process.  I accept Deputy Fahey has stated his position in that regard.  How does he respond to the question I asked about the fact that some people were notified about the launch of the scheme prior to others?</p>]
[<p eid="para_151">A question mark arises because the impression is given that some people were put in an advantageous position.  I surmise that the Byrne family would contend that they were severely disadvantaged by the make-up of the scheme even though the Ombudsman acknowledges that they did not fit all of the criteria but she was working according to the principle of natural justice.  Natural justice was well served if one's name was Paddy Mullen or Tony Faherty but it was not if one's name was Mrs. Winifred Byrne.  That is something that needs to be addressed to allay the concerns of ordinary people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_155">With all due respect, to what meeting do the minutes refer?  It is a contemporaneous record taken by a colleague of Deputy Fahey.  It is not the minute of an official meeting.</p>]
[<p eid="para_157">I know I have limited time.</p>]
[<p eid="para_161">Let us stick to the Ombudsman's report.  Were the 16 owners notified then?  Is it the case that all 16 were contacted and not just Paddy Mullen and Tony Faherty?</p>]
[<p eid="para_164">Deputy Fahey contends it is somehow coincidental that Mr. Paddy Mullen and Mr. Tony Flaherty happen to be his constituents, because there were 16 persons in total, many of whom were not constituents of his, who also benefited from a notification of the scheme.</p>]
