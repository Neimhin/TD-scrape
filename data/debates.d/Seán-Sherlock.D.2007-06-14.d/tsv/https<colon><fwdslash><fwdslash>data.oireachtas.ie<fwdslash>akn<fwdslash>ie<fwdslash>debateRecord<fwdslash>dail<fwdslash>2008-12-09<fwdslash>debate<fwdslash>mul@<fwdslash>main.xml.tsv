[<p eid="para_45">On the basis that the debate will take place forthwith, I wish to withdraw my submission, with the permission of the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_147">I will share time with Deputy Willie Penrose.</p>, <p eid="para_148">I express solidarity with all pig producers in the organic and non-organic sector, craft butchers, processors and every worker who has been adversely affected by this crisis.  Public health and consumer confidence must be restored immediately.  This will be the indicator of the future viability of the pigmeat industry.  Producers have been unfairly plunged into a crisis which is not of their making.  Farms which purchased contaminated feed did so in good faith and on the basis that the product was licensed.</p>, <p eid="para_149">The pork industry is the fourth largest in the agriculture sector and is worth approximately €400 million per annum.  I understand exports of pigmeat were worth €212 million in 2007.  In that context, we must take cognisance of the fact that only ten of a possible 400 producers have been affected by contaminated feed.  I understand the producers in question produce less than 10% of the overall kill.  The minimal number of producers affected should help restore public confidence because if the figures I cite are correct, 90% of the pig kill is beyond reproach and scientific evidence will show that the risk to human health diminishes significantly.</p>, <p eid="para_150">We cannot underestimate the importance of the meat industry.  Having listened carefully to the Taoiseach and Minister, I note that neither of them referred to a timeline for the return of pork to the shelves.  I understood from the Taoiseach that the European Food Safety Authority must make this call from a scientific perspective.  I call on the authority and European Commission to make allowance for the importance of the meat industry to this State.  These institutions must act as soon as possible to ensure products are placed on the shelves again and public confidence restored.  If the European Union will not provide a compensation package, at least Commissioner Kuneva and the EFSA should issue a statement within 24 to 48 hours indicating that production can commence again.</p>, <p eid="para_151">The true test of patriotism, if I may use that word, is to stand in solidarity on this issue.  We should not use it to score political points off the Minister.  We all know family farmers or workers in processing plants whose livelihoods depend on a viable pig and beef industry.  At the same time, however, fundamental questions must be asked of the Department.  I call on the Minister to act with greater urgency and to implore the European Commission to make a statement forthwith to enable the industry to start working again.</p>, <p eid="para_152">While the Government was correct to introduce a total recall of pork products, if the problem affected less than 10% of producers and 90% of pork products are thereby deemed to be safe and fit for human consumption, the Minister should have made a statement in the 24 to 48 hour period following the total recall indicating that production could recommence.  He should clarify the reason this has not been done.</p>, <p eid="para_153">If the traceability system was working adequately and the one-step-up, one-step-back principle was being adhered to, it would have been possible to isolate the relevant producers and stop their production.  This would have allowed other producers who never used this material to continue to provide product for the market.  This issue must also be addressed.</p>, <p eid="para_154">The national feed inspection programme is a rigorous regime applied to all primary producers, whether pig or beef farmers.  Everything which reaches the farm gate is subject to the most stringent inspection controls in the world.  Why did the inspection process for feedstuffs fail in respect of the producer in question?  The systems failure which occurred has significantly diminished the potential of the pig and pigmeat industry.  The sector will take a long time to claw its way back to its previous position.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_155">We need to show solidarity with all the players in the industry.  This is a national issue on which the Labour Party will support the Minister in every step of the process.  Nevertheless, the problem must be handled with a greater sense of urgency.</p>]
[<p eid="para_215">I have three questions.  Will there be a new regulatory framework dealing with non-food grade oil, as I understand it?  My second question relates to the routine sample of pork fat.  The Minister stated on 28 November that a routine sample of pork fat taken as part of his Department's national residue monitoring programme was shown to be positive for the presence of non-dioxin-like marker PCBs.  Is there routine testing for PCBs on an ongoing basis throughout the food industry?  On Friday, 28 November we were told that this indicative testing took place.  On 4 December the Department issued a press release confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.  The Dutch authorities contacted the Department and the FSAI regarding their independent investigation.  When they communicated that, how long had the Dutch authorities' investigation been in train?  When was the rapid alert system kicked into action?  This is also an important point.  The Minister has told us this all happened on this island, effectively.  However, there is a school of thought that suggests the rapid alert kicked in long before this process and we need some clarification on that point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_250">On a point of order, if that trade notice went out and the product is verifiable, why is stock not back on the shelves in pork butchers throughout the country?</p>]
[<p eid="para_295">On a point of order, we have only had one question from this side of the House so far.</p>]
[<p eid="para_928">I wish to share time with Deputy Willie Penrose and I propose to take seven minutes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_930">Something that does not necessarily relate to the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, given that we do not have many opportunities to discuss fisheries is the additional funding emergency measures were agreed in July.  It is still urgent that progress be made to make funds available at the earliest possible date.  I understand that the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, has made submissions and there is an ongoing campaign.  We all know that fuel prices have decreased dramatically but the cost inputs for fishermen during that period were significant as were losses incurred during that period.  We should support that measure. Will that €37 million expenditure be expedited?  Perhaps the officials could revert to us in due course on this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_931">With the pending December Council of Ministers meeting due on 18 and 19 December, it is important that this House give time to debating the issues at hand.  I have had some significant briefings today from the FIF, more specifically from the Irish South and West Fish Producers' Organisation, on the issues.  It is worth reiterating some of the points they make.</p>, <p eid="para_932">They state that the decisions taken at the December Council meeting will be vital to the future of the industry.  I note the Minister of State said he supports the appropriate conservation measures for Celtic Sea cod such as spawning area closures which were originally proposed by fishermen and are delivering positive effects on stock levels in that area.  The organisation's position is such that it proposes that the creation of a sub-divided management area separating the English Channel from the rest of the existing Celtic Sea, has certain implications for Ireland.  The organisation's briefing paper states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_933">The separation of Area VIId, the English Channel, from the remainder of Area VIIb-k for the purposes of management, and the establishment of a separate Total Allowable Catch for that area has significant implications for the Irish fishing industry.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_934">While the measure is not objectionable in itself, the subdivision of the stock must not disadvantage Irish fishermen by directly dividing the quotas, giving Ireland quota in an area (VIId) where Irish fishermen do not fish.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_935">Irish fishermen catch most of the Cod in the west of the existing management area, to the south of Ireland.  This must be reflected in the new subdivision of quota between the management areas.</p>, <p eid="para_936">I could not have put the argument any better.</p>, <p eid="para_937">With regard to the proposals on the fishing effort, there is a school of thought that suggests that the European Commission is effectively re-writing, after the fact, the decision reached by the Council.  The FIF state that the Commission is re-writing the text of the decision on fishing effort in the Irish Sea and the north west which was reached at last month's EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council.  This cannot be allowed as it would mean an immediate 25% cut in fishing possibilities in 2009, from what was in the decision which was in itself misguided, draconian and punitive.  The November Council of Fisheries Ministers reached a decision on a new and intensified series of measures for fisheries in the Irish Sea and the north west.  I also understand that the Irish Government and industry succeeded in thwarting the efforts to have this approach extended to the south and west coasts.  The FIF has stated this to me today.  The measure agreed which affect the Irish Sea and north west, clearly curtailed fishing effort in the form of kilowatt-days to the amount of effort in previous base years.  It has only come to light in recent days that the Commission is going significantly beyond what was agreed and it now proposes in 2009 to impose a further 25% cut from the base effort.  This is contrary to all understanding of what was agreed.  I understand the Minister may share this position but he needs to put it on the record of the House at some stage.</p>, <p eid="para_938">I note the Minister of State's statement on the Hague Preferences, that they are an integral part of the TAC, total allowable catch and quota allocations system and they must continue to be allocated or formally incorporated into the TAC and quota system and not perhaps subjected to the annual approval which they must undergo.  I understand the point made by the Minister of State when he states that certain member states would seek to denigrate or downgrade that agreement.  The position adopted by the FIF in continuing to ensure that the Hague issues are maintained, is paramount to the industry in the future.  More recently there has been positive interplay between the fishermen's organisations and the Minister.  The emergency package agreed in July, however, needs to be expedited.  It is a matter of grave importance to the industry.</p>]
