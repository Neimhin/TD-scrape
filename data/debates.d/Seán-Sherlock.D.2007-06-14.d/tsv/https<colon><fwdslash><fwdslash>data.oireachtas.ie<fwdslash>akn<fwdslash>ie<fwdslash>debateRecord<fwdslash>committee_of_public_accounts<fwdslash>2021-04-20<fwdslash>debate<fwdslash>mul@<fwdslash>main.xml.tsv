[<p eid="para_129">I will go straight into questions. I thank Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for being here.</p>, <p eid="para_130"> I want to ask about the fishery harbour centres financial reporting and financial management review group within the Department.

[<p eid="para_141">That is a fair lot of invoices.</p>]
