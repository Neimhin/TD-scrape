SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	I will go straight into questions. I thank Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for being here. I want to ask about the fishery harbour centres financial reporting and financial management review group within the Department. It is quite a mouthful of a name. First, when specifically will the work of that group be completed? Second, there is to be a report on debt management. I am trying to understand why specifically there is to be a report on debt management; what is the nature of that debt and how much is that debt?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	I apologise for interrupting Mr. Gleeson. What is the nature of the debt? Are we talking about the charging regime within those entities?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	How much is outstanding in debt on the books of the six centres?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	Forgive my blinding ignorance. In real time, as of today, how much is outstanding in dues?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	That is a fair lot of invoices.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:20:00+01:00	I understand.I will move on. I thank Dr. Beamish because that is enlightening. Regarding the review of the review of the charging order, when does Mr. Gleeson propose to go to the public consultation process? Is he going to the public consultation process with a view to increasing the charging order?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:30:00+01:00	I thank Mr. Gleeson. It does my heart good to hear him say that, because all businesses in the current climate need a fighting chance, especially those people who live in coastal communities. I will draw a line under that and thank him for that.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-04-20T19:30:00+01:00	I wanted to talk about greyhounds.
