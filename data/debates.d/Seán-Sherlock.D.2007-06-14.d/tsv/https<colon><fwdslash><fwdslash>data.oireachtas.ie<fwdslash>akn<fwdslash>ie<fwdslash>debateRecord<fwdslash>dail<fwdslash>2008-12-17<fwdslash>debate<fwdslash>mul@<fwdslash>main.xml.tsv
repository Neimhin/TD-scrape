[<p eid="para_325">I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, whether the Government will seek publication of a report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland into issues relating to child protection procedures in the diocese of Cloyne, if the Government will confirm if this report was commissioned by the Department of Health and Children, if the recommendations of that report have been implemented, and if certain persons have been removed from positions of responsibility in relation to child protection.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1175">I wish to share time with Deputy Penrose.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1177">I appreciate that we all had to act in unison last week and take the Minister's statements in good faith as the crisis unfolded.  Across the political divide we acted in the public interest.  A total product recall was the only way to go to restore consumer confidence and export markets in the long run.  This week, however, we are at a different juncture.  The Minister is now asking us to stand over a payment of €50 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  I have serious reservations about it because the Minister has not provided sufficient detail on how that sum will be spent down to the last euro.  I agree that the compensation package must be negotiated but the lack of detail shows a certain disregard for Opposition Members who represent all sides, including consumers, farm workers and processors.  We should be provided with far more detail of this Supplementary Estimate, given that it is taxpayers' money.</p>, <p eid="para_1178">My understanding is that this €50 million payout will cover interim payments to processors, although that is not stated in the Minister's speech.  Perhaps we can get some clarification on that.  I did not hear anything in the speech to indicate that workers who were left out of pocket through last week's closure of plants will be compensated.  If plants such as Rossderragh are not in a position to compensate workers for loss of pay, which occurred through no fault of their own, there is a strong case for the Government to compensate them.  That is not an unreasonable request in this instance.  I am disappointed, however, that there is no detail of such a scheme in the speech.</p>, <p eid="para_1179">I did not write a speech in advance of this debate because I wanted to listen to the Minister before responding.  I wanted my remarks to be based on his speech.  Over the past 72 hours, I have read a great deal about Millstream Recycling company in Bunclody.  The Minister stated: "In regard to the specific investigation into the source of the contamination, my Department is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Garda".  Why is the Garda involved?  Is it the Department's opinion that an illegal or nefarious process was involved?  If people are being asked to stand over a payout to the industry of between €50 million and €180 million, it is fair that they ask pertinent questions as to why the Garda has become involved.</p>, <p eid="para_1180">The Minister also stated: "The investigations focus on the type of fuel used in a burner which dried surplus food material for animal feed and the appropriateness of this type of oil".  He went on to state: "In view of the apparent link to the type of fuel used in the drying process, I am asking the European Commission to consider whether the type of oil to be used by feed business operators can be more strictly regulated".  It appears that the use of this type of fuel is not governed by the Department's rules, the hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation or EU regulations.  Will the Minister clarify this issue and inform the House as to why the Garda is involved?  If the Garda is involved, a nefarious scheme is the presumption.  If there was an illegal process, will there be a source of redress?  Was the Millstream process illegal?  It is the reason for this debate.  The process will cost the State up to €180 million.</p>, <p eid="para_1181">Ironically, anything that I have read about the factory in question suggested that the process was a forward looking venture well ahead of the posse in terms of new industry initiatives.  This does not sit well and I hope that we are not hanging a particular individual out to dry.  The issue must be addressed transparently.  While we agree that compensatory measures must be put in place, we need to know who negotiated the package on behalf of the pig industry.  We also need to know when the funding will be divvied up and, in light of the public interest, whether the details of who gets what will become available.  If the taxpayers are to cover the cost, it is only fair that they know what is at stake and in play.</p>, <p eid="para_1182">There has been a failure of regulation, but I do not attribute it to the Government necessarily.  By way of constructive criticism, I suggest that we have a single figurehead — a supremo, if the House wills — to be in charge of food regulation.  I am not discussing the creation of a new agency or quango.  However, the statements issued by the Department, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the European Food Safety Authority could give rise to a certain degree of confusion as to where competencies lie in food safety.  It took some 24 hours to realise that competence lay with the FSAI.  Rather than a merger of competencies, I propose there be one voice within the regulatory framework so that when the members of the Fourth Estate and the Legislature need questions answered, we will know to whom we should go.</p>, <p eid="para_1183">More details are necessary.  I will stand over the Department's decision to effect a withdrawal.  We stand over the necessary compensatory package, but there should be more detail.</p>]

[<p eid="para_1212">Will the Minister of State respond to our questions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_1736">A lot done, more to do.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1815">There is a local authority housing development in Mitchelstown, north County Cork.  The houses are some of the finest I have ever seen and there is a mixture of social and affordable housing.  However, many of the affordable houses are empty because they cannot be sold.  The empty houses have given rise to anti-social behaviour, as a consequence of which they have been vandalised.  The estate is wonderful and the residents are very proud of where they live.  They have organised residents' associations.  However, they are very concerned that some of the empty affordable houses will not be sold, as they have been on the market for almost two years.  I have a list as long as one's arm of people in the Mitchelstown area who would gladly take one of these houses if they were transferred to social housing status.</p>, <p eid="para_1816">Officials in the northern division of Cork County Council told me that because of certain funding and resource stipulations put in place during the preparation of the affordable housing scheme, the status of these houses cannot be changed from affordable to social housing.  I am certain that is not the only such estate in the country.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should allow some flexibility.  In cases where the social housing waiting list is of a certain size, it could show some degree of flexibility to ensure such houses are occupied.  In this way the problems of anti-social behaviour can be offset.  We need a common-sense approach to the use of empty houses under the auspices of local authorities.</p>, <p eid="para_1817">I refer to the tenant purchase scheme.  I have encountered many people who have paid rent to local authorities and invested thousands of euro in their house during the years.  As a result of restrictions on the tenant purchase scheme, they are prevented from purchasing their house.  If there was greater flexibility and the discounting system was more extensive, many older local authority residents who have invested much money in their house and made it their own could purchase it.  It would realise a certain amount for the State and allow it, in turn, to embark on a further housing programme.  I realise that my colleague, Deputy Lynch, has done a lot of work in this area, which I acknowledge.  The State must find imaginative solutions to this problem and should examine the possibility of introducing such schemes.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Cuffe, stated in his contribution to the debate that some progress had been made.  However, a good deal more could be made and many imaginative solutions implemented.  We may propose such solutions through motions and the work of Deputy Lynch who is the Labour Party spokesperson on the issue.  Such solutions must be taken on board.  We seek to work positively to address the issue.</p>, <p eid="para_1818">Many rural dwellers do not wish to be shepherded into large urban areas to be facilitated in social housing.  The State must make provision for such persons and allow them, if eligible for social housing, to be housed within their communities.  The vibrancy of any community depends on a housing mix in which that demographic is also catered for.</p>]
[<p eid="para_2111">In raising this matter, I am seeking to highlight the fact that, in the view of the 100 plus GPs who refer people to it, Mallow General Hospital is a centre of excellence.  It is also a secondary care facility that caters for the needs of a population base of well over 100,000.  If the national service plan, as envisaged, is implemented, the accident and emergency department at Mallow General Hospital will be downgraded to a minor injuries unit.  The GPs from whom I have received representations and the people who live in the area want to know what will be the future of the accident and emergency department.  There is a concern that if it is downgraded to the status of a minor injuries unit, many GPs in the area will bypass Mallow General Hospital and refer people instead to Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Given an expected population base of 4.53 million in 2009, it is vital hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital maintain some coherence in terms of accident and emergency services.  Reducing or diminishing it to a minor injuries clinic will result in more people being put into the narrow funnel that is Cork University Hospital, which is not the way to go.</p>, <p eid="para_2112">I have taken advice on the matter from general practitioners who refer stroke patients and people with heart complaints to this hospital.  Many of these interventions can be dealt with by the accident and emergency department.  Downgrading the hospital to a minor injuries unit will have an adverse effect on outcomes for patients.</p>]
