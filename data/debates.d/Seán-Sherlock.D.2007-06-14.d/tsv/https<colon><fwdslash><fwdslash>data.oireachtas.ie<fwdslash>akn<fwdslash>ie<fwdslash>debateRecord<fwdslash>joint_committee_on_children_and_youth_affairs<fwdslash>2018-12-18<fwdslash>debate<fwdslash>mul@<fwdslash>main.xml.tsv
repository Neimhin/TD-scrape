SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	I will try to give the Minister a fair hearing and look at the issue in a cold and rational way. I understand from her response that a set of substantive recommendations, arising from the operational review, is being enacted but that she will not publish a report which underpins the recommendations. Is that assessment correct?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	I wish to tease out the reasons for the Minister's decision. We have all received most of the freedom of information legislation material based on the work of Justine McCarthy of RTÉ. I also have correspondence dated 17 November 2017. The report was received in February 2017, almost a full two years ago. I am reluctant to name people, but there is correspondence from the chairperson of the board to a senior person in the Department which states the board's view remained that it was not legally safe to place the report in the public domain and that it could see no basis for deviating from the position or distinguishing between different types of publication. I understand some of the reason for the use of the phrase "legally safe" on the basis that, in giving it to certain stakeholders, it could be deemed to be legally published. However, I am confused and worried about the Minister's submission, in which she stated:When I was last here I advised the committee that the board of management of Oberstown had decided that it was not safe to publish the report on that review. This decision was based on a careful and lengthy process of deliberation, including the commissioning of independent legal advice.The board has its own independent legal advice, while the Minister has the advice of the Attorney General. Is there a conflict between the advice of the Attorney General and the board's legal advice on whether the Minister could or could not safely publish the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	Was the Minister minded to publish the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	If the Attorney General's report states, on more than one occasion, that there was no impediment to publication of the report, it would be logical for the Minister to deem it safe to publish it. What are the risks? Was the advice received from the Attorney General clear on the publication of the report? Did the Attorney General hedge his position? I understand the Minister will not go into the detail of the content of the Attorney General's advice, but it would be helpful if we could be given the sense that it was the Minister's intention to publish the report. There is always a risk, but there does not appear to have been a prima facie case against the report's publication from the Government's point of view. Is there a statutory entitlement on the part of the board not to publish?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	Frankly, I do not understand that. I am not a lawyer, but I look at it from the layman's perspective. Many stakeholders have had access to the report.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	Did HIQA not have access to the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	Did the Department of Justice and Equality have access to it?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	Are HIQA and the Minister's Department the only two stakeholders that had access to the report?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	What does the Minister mean by "fair procedure"? Can she spell it out in very simple terms?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:00:00+00:00	That is the point. Individuals were named in the Goldson-Hardwick report.Are there specific named persons who it is believed are entitled to fair procedure? Is that the reason the report is not being published?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	The Minister is saying the process of the report-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	I appreciate that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	I am keen to have the point clarified to ensure I understand it correctly. Is the Minister saying there was a flaw in the process? Perhaps I do not mean a flaw in the process but rather the question of whether the process was imperfect to the point of saying there was nothing built in to allow persons possibly named in the report to be afforded due process and an entitlement to their good name, to use the language of the law of tort.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	To be helpful to the Minister, I will refer to correspondence received from senior officials. The relevant date is 13 November 2017. The correspondence states the Department is of the view that the following are mechanisms to progress matters to ensure the matters raised are addressed in respect of the board and principal people within it. The first mechanism is a response to the authors of the report pointing to the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management at Oberstown to ensure persons criticised in the report have been fairly heard. The alternative mechanism would involve a submission by the board and management of the Oberstown campus on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the Oireachtas joint committee, with the report. The officials sought to arrange a meeting between the relevant people and the Department to discuss the matter since the Minister was due to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on 22 November. As I recall, the issues did not arise at that meeting, but the Minister did anticipate that they would arise. They are arising now. On what we are strident - I think the Minister is seeing unity across the members of the committee in that regard - is the fact that I would not be doing my job if I left here with questions on my mind about the content of a report from eminent persons such as Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but is there some cover-up of practices at the Oberstown centre about which we need to hear in the public interest? Are people being protected unduly? The conflict I have in my mind is that I must always take steps to protect the good name of individuals and due process, but there is also the matter of the public interest. Notwithstanding the facts that the recommendations are being implemented, that HIQA is now in Oberstown and that there is a clear pathway in the improvements being made, we still have the sword of Damocles of the report hanging over our heads as an Oireachtas committee and I do not believe we will be satisfied until we receive clearer answers on its publication. I do not believe the public will be satisfied until it is published.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	We need clear answers to certain questions. What is the level of risk inherent in the Attorney General's advice to the Minister? There was possibly more than one piece of advice. Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter. There may have been more than one engagement with the Attorney General's office. Frankly, I do not think the Attorney General said to the Minister of the day that it was the advice of the office not to publish the report.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	I come at it from the point of view of being respectful of the Minister's position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	Have they responded since? I am asking the question specifically about whether the process of publication of the report-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	The persons named in the report. I am referring to the persons or entities and practices criticised in the report. Have they had a chance to respond?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	Were they invited back?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	Were they invited back? Was the process designed to accommodate it? That is why I am talking about the process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	Was the process designed in such a way that if findings were made against persons or the entity, there would be a right of reply?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	They did not do that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:10:00+00:00	I think it is a little clearer now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:30:00+00:00	I am trying to reconcile in my own mind the interpretation of the Minister and the Department regarding the status of the report. If there is respect for due procedures, then there is an entitlement on the part of those who are the subject of the report to due process. Given that there was no further interaction between Professors Goldson and Hardwick, and notwithstanding the fact Oberstown is implementing the recommendations and HIQA is across that, does this mean this report is still, arguably, in the Minister's or the Department's interpretation, not a full but a draft report, and incomplete in that sense as per the terms of reference?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:30:00+00:00	This is where the FOI data come into play. I refer to a document of 15 August 2017 in this regard. I have a full set of the documents through FOI. The source is RTÉ and this is in the public domain. There is a letter in the Department which states that there is confusion generally as to the status of the report and that, while the reviewers consider the report to be the final report, this was not necessarily the view of the Department or Oberstown.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:30:00+00:00	If the Minister tells us there is a conflict between the reviewers in terms of an understanding of what the status of the report is, that will provide some clarity. However, notwithstanding the advices of the Attorney General in the context of risk, as I understand it, the Minister still has full discretion, based on those advices, as to whether she wishes to publish the report. I am only one Member of the Oireachtas. I note the Minister's earlier comments in respect of the mandate of this committee but we are all also Members of the Oireachtas and we speak to the public interest and can question anything at any time. Notwithstanding the mandate of this committee, it is my view that the Minister should publish and be damned, as they say, and put it all out there in the public domain.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:30:00+00:00	I suggest we will be revisiting this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:30:00+00:00	To give the Minister some food for thought, I did not get into the statement that was issued by Professor Barry Goldson on 10 November, where he states very clearly in the public domain that he gave the board and the various stakeholders every opportunity to engage with him in respect of the issues before they went to publication. On the face of it, there seems to be a contradiction between the Minister and the Department's position and that of Goldson and Hardwick in this respect.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	In terms of the procedures-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	I asked previously in terms of fair procedures whether the reviewers went back and my understanding of the Minister's response was that they did not go back.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	They are saying in their statement that they offered every opportunity before coming to their final report for the individuals involved, or for Oberstown, to provide further details or clarification of points they had made.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	It seems to me that perhaps the mechanisms or procedures operated by the reviewers were more robust than we had previously understood. The impression has been given here that they were less than robust. I would contend, based on that statement, that Goldson and Hardwick were more than comprehensive in respect of their interaction with Oberstown. This needs to be teased out further.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	Is the Minister finished with the process following the Oberstown report? I apologise to the Chairman for taking up so much time on this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	It would appear, on the face of it, based on Goldson and Hardwick, that everybody in Oberstown was given the right to reply or was allowed due procedure. I am certainly of the impression, however, based on the Minister's interaction with us, that this is not her interpretation of events. That is where the question lies in my mind.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T18:40:00+00:00	That is the point made by Deputy Lisa Chambers.
