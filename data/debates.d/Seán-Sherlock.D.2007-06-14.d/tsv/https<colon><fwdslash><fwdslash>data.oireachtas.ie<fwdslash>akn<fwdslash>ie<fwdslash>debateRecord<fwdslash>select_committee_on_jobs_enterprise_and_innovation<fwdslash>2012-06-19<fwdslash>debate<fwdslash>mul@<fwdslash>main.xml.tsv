SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I move amendment No. 54:
In page 15, to delete lines 15 to 23 and substitute the following:"(4) Following a review under subsection (1) -(a ) where the Court is satisfied that to do so would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and assist in the avoidance of industrial unrest, the Court may recommend that-(i) the joint labour committee is maintained in its current form,(ii) the joint labour committee is amalgamated with another joint labour committee, or(iii) the establishment order pursuant to which the joint labour committee was established is amended,or(b ) where the Court is satisfied that it is no longer appropriate to maintain a joint labour committee the Court may recommend that the joint labour committee is abolished.”.Section 11 inserts a new section 41A, after section 41 of the 1946 Act, to provide that the Labour Court will, following the commencement of this Act and at regular five year intervals thereafter, conduct a review of all establishment orders in respect of existing joint labour committees.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a more explicit ordering of the priority ranking of the principles and policies to be taken into account by the Labour Court in carrying out these periodic reviews of a joint labour committee.  In this regard, priority considerations are the "common good" or public interest objectives of establishing harmonious industrial relations between workers and employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest.  As regards the outcome of the review process, the amendment also specifies that the Labour Court may recommend retention of the JLC in its current form as well as recommending in favour of an amendment of the existing establishment order or the amalgamation of the JLC with another JLC or its abolition.

In page 15, line 43, to delete "(7) An order under subsection (5)" and substitute "(8) An order under subsection (6)".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 65:
In page 16, line 1, to delete "(8) Every order under subsection (5)" and substitute "(9) Every order under subsection (6)".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 66:
In page 16, to delete lines 12 to 15 and substitute the following:"42A.-(1) Subject to this section and section 42B, a joint labour committee may, where it is satisfied that such proposals would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest, submit proposals for an employment regulation order to the Court.".Section 12 sets out, inter alia, the principles and policies that should guide the formulation of joint labour committees of proposals on the fixing of remuneration and conditions of employment and the regulation of the joint labour committee decision-making process.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide for a more explicit ordering of the priority ranking of the principles and policies to be taken into account by a joint labour committee in considering proposals for the making or variation of an employment regulation order.  In this regard, the priority considerations that should inform the deliberations of a JLC in deciding whether to propose an ERO are the public interest objectives of establishing harmonious industrial relations between workers and employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Section 12 provides for a number of amendments that are required to the legislative provisions relating to the operation of joint labour committees.  It accordingly inserts into the 1946 Act a new section 42A, which includes at section 42A(4) a provision that the JLC may make proposals to fix a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned for all or any such workers.This amendment proposes to provide that skill levels in addition to length of service be also taken into account in setting pay rates.  A Government amendment to section 12, amendment No. 68, provides that proposals for EROs may provide for a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned, as well as the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 68:
In page 16, line 39, after "concerned," to insert the following:"or the attainment of recognised standards or skills in the sector concerned,".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Section 42A(5) clarifies the relationship between the adult wage rates that may be proposed by a JLC and the sub-minimum rates under EROs expressed as the same fixed percentages of the minimum hourly rate of remuneration as set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in respect of employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  In future, JLCs will be permitted to set out a basic adult rate and two supplementary minimum rates.  This will subsequently reduce the number of rates while acknowledging the freedom of JLCs to establish two higher hourly rates based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned or the attainment of recognised standards or skills.  Sub-minimum rates expressed as fixed percentages of the adult basic rate will apply as in the case of the national minimum wage to employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  All other rates of pay will be agreed at firm level.  The effect of the proposed Sinn Féin amendment would be to remove the "sub-minima" elements from the scope of proposals for remuneration from a JLC with only the adult rates remaining.On amendment No. 70, section 12 provides for a number of amendments that are required to the legislative provisions relating to the formulation of proposals for employment regulation orders by joint labour committees, including in relation to the principles and policies that should guide the formulation of such proposals on the fixing of remuneration and conditions of employment.  In this context, section 12 inserts into the 1946 Act a new section 42A(5) which clarifies the relationship between the adult wages rate that may be proposed by a JLC and the sub-minimum rates under EROs expressed as the same fixed percentage of the minimum hourly rate of remuneration as set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in respect of employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  Specifically, subsection (5)(d) provides that proposals for EROs shall provide that a worker who has attained the age of 18 years and during normal working hours undergoes a course of study or training prescribed in regulations made by the Minister under section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 shall be remunerated at an hourly rate reduced to the percentage set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of that Act.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Prescribed Courses of Study or Training) Regulations 2000 sets down the comprehensive criteria a course of study or training must satisfy for the purposes of section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  The criteria include that the duration of the course is for a minimum period of three calendar months, that the training enables the acquisition of skills and-or knowledge expected to enhance the work performance of the employee at the end of the course, and assessment and certification procedures.  In addition, a separate amendment proposed by the Minister will provide that proposals for employment regulation orders, EROs, may provide for a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned as well as the length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned which was contained in the published Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	To be helpful, there are criteria in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in regard to study or training courses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We can come back to that, Chairman.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I am glad that I am not getting on the wrong side of Deputy Willie O'Dea.  By way of explanation, section 12 inserts a new section 42A into the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a joint labour committee, JLC, must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders, EROs.  These principles and policies are set out in section 42A(6)(a) to (d) of the Bill.  This amendment proposes to require a JLC to take account of rather than have regard to such principles and policies.  On the advice of the Attorney General, the Government has agreed that the catalogue of principles and policies contained in sections 5, 11 and 12 should be developed to provide for a more explicit ordering of their priority ranking, and Government amendments are proposed.  In this regard, when formulating proposals for EROs, a priority consideration for a JLC is that the terms of the recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest.The Minister has put forward separate amendments to these sections to deal with the necessity for providing for a hierarchy of principles in this regard.  Such a hierarchy of principles is needed not least in anticipation of further legal challenge to address tensions between constitutional issues, that is, freedom of contract and property rights on the one hand and the common good, that is, harmonious industrial relations on the other.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 73:
In page 17, to delete lines 45 to 51 and in page 18, to delete lines 1 to 10 and substitute the following:"(b) the general level of wages in comparable sectors;(c) where enterprises in the sector in question are in competition with enterprises in another Member State, the general level of wages in the enterprises in that other Member State taking into account the cost of living in the Member State concerned;(d) the national minimum hourly rate of pay declared by order for the time being in force under section 11 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, and the appropriateness or otherwise of fixing a statutory minimum hourly rate of pay above that rate; and(e) the terms of any relevant national agreement relating to pay and conditions for the time being in existence.”.Section 12 as presented inserts a new section 42A into the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a JLC must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders, EROs.  Section 42A(6) as presented provides that a JLC must have regard to, among other factors, the general level of wages in comparable sectors, including, where appropriate, the general level of wages in such comparable sectors in other relevant jurisdictions.  The objective of amendment No. 73 is to ensure that comparisons of minimum wages for the purposes of framing EROs would take account of differences in price levels between European Union member states reflecting purchasing power parities for household consumption expenditure.While particular attention had been given to providing that wage comparisons, having regard to the rates paid in other jurisdictions, should only be conducted on the basis of a "fair and reasonable assessment", the parliamentary counsel's advice in respect of the provisions in sections 5 and 12 was that the specific concerns raised in this regard could best be addressed by specifying instead, first, the cost of living and, second, a restriction of the field of comparison to only those EU member states with which firms covered by JLCs and registered employment agreements, REAs, can be found to be in competition, and that they should be included as factors to be assessed in setting wages.A similar provision as regards wage comparisons has been addressed already in subsection 3B(k) inserted by amendment No. 3, which I understand has been agreed.  Accordingly, comparisons are only applicable where firms covered by JLCs can be found to be in competition with enterprises in other EU member states.  The European Union has developed a model of economic and social development which extends beyond the diversity of national situations and is based on common values and principles, in particular, the objective affirmed in the treaty of promoting hand in hand economic and social progress.EU member states have already ratified a large number of ILO conventions relating in particular to core labour standards, labour inspection, labour administration, employment, social security and wages.  Most EU member states currently have statutory or otherwise legally binding or generally applicable minimum wages in place.  The impact of a national minimum wage on both demand and supply can differ markedly across member states depending on the level set as well as other labour market policies and institutions.  The thrust of EU employment policy is that wage floors need to be sufficiently adjustable with the social partners actively engaged in ensuring wage settlements reflect overall economic developments.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I believe the issue was also raised with regard to an earlier amendment as we debated this particular issue.  If I am not mistaken the Minister, Deputy Bruton, gave an undertaking to examine it.  We feel taking the cost of living into account and restricting the field of comparison to only those EU member states with firms covered by JLCs and REAs is an equitable way forward.  I am trying to understand the Deputy's point in respect of employers but, respectfully, I did not quite understand the point made on how they are given a greater role.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Deputy proposes to apply more qualitative criteria to the process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Government feels the criteria are well met and that the JLCs sit above the national minimum wage in any sense.  I do not think we should look for increased criteria above the level of wages.  This is the Government's view on the matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The stark political reality in regard to the national minimum wage is that this Government restored it.  We brought many people back into a wage that, arguably, is more of a living wage than those who served in previous mandate sought to have available given that it reduced their rights and entitlements.  We must take that into account as well.I refer to the amendments and to section 42A(7).  This amendment provides for a new commonsense or straightforward definition of remuneration for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs so that such proposals may no longer include pay or time off from work in lieu of public holidays; compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, resulting for required work on a Sunday, a section that will continue to apply separately and should not be duplicated in any ERO; payments in lieu of notice; or payments referrable to a worker's redundancy.  This amendment would include these provisions in the definition of remuneration.  This definition is provided in order to comply with the Government's decision that in future JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  In particular, provision for a Sunday premium will be removed from the scope of EROs while preserving workers' entitlements under section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  In this context, it is proposed to complement the removal of the Sunday premium from the purview of JLCs with a direction to the Labour Relations Commission to devise a code of practice for Sunday working.  The proposed code would provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives, in sections covered by EROs, on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options as specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The code of practice will subsequently be given formal status by means of a ministerial order.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	To reiterate, section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides protection.  If we are talking about the status of the EROs, what is their status post July and post the High Court?  One must ask oneself that question.  What we are seeking to do through this legislation is to give a protection through the proposed code which at least provides guidance in respect of sectors covered by the EROs on arrangements that could be put in place to comply with section 14 of that very same Act.I refer to those workers who would have had certain premia prior to July.  The question we must ask ourselves is where the evidence is of people bringing cases to rights commissioners post July, where they would have recourse to do so?  We have to find a mechanism here and we believe strongly that the LRC approach, with the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, provides the best way forward in terms of the protection of those workers.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 79:
In page 19, to delete lines 13 to 31 and substitute the following:"(7) When making a recommendation under subsection (6), the Court shall—(a) be satisfied that the terms of the recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest, and(b) have regard to the following:(i) the representations made by the parties at the hearing;(ii) any relevant code of practice for the purposes of the Industrial Relations Act 1990;(iii) the economic and commercial circumstances in relation to the sector to which the joint labour committee relates;(iv) the rates of remuneration and conditions of employment of workers in similar employment sectors, including workers in a sector to which another joint labour committee relates;(v) the merits of the dispute and the terms upon which it should be settled.".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 81:
In page 19, to delete lines 44 to 47 and substitute the following:"equal division of votes the chairman shall cast his or her vote having regard to the recommendation of the Court.".This amendment provides for the removal of the reference in section 9 of the Bill to the chairman of a joint labour committee having "a second or casting vote" in the circumstances envisaged in the proposed new section 42B(9).  The intention of the amendment is to clarify the purpose of the section and to improve the drafting of the Bill.  The general policy objective of the new provision is that the chairman of a joint labour committee will be a non-voting member of the committee other than in circumstances in which the procedure set out in the new section is exhausted and the employer and the working members of the joint labour committee agree on the implementation of the labour court recommendation in question.  It is proposed that in such circumstances, the chairman will be allowed to cast a single vote, having regard to the recommendation of the Labour Court, but not "a second or casting vote" as provided for in the new section 42B(9).  Essentially, this amendment has been tabled to make a correction.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I have an open mind on the Deputy's comments but I also have regard for the Minister's comments on encompassing some of these issues on workplace relations and future legislation.  I shall try to be helpful and approach the matter pragmatically having regard for the arguments made.  I suggest that we examine the issue again at Report Stage and a specific view can be given then.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	With regard to NERA, the Deputy wants to create the maximum leeway for workers and he gave prescriptive examples.  Perhaps we can examine it again at a further stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We should examine all three of the amendments and their nuances.  They deal with issues that are pertinent to complaints lodged with rights commissioners and we will examine them again at Report Stage in that context.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 87:
In page 26, lines 6 to 8, to delete all words from and including "referred" in line 6 down to and including "after" in line 8 and substitute the following:"specified for the time being in section 26 of the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1840, for each day or part of a day beginning 6 weeks after".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 90:
In page 27, to delete lines 33 to 37 and substitute the following:"(3) (a) Subject to paragraph (b) the Court shall not grant an exemption to an employer under subsection (1) if the employer has been granted an exemption in respect of the same worker or workers under that subsection within the previous 5 years.(b) Where an exemption under subsection (1) has been granted for a period of less than 24 months, an employer or employer’s representative with the employer’s consent may, prior to the date on which the exemption is due to expire, apply to the Court to extend the period of the exemption for an additional period.(c) Where an application is made under paragraph (b) the Court shall not extend the period of the exemption for more than 24 months from the date on which the exemption was granted.(d) Where the period of the exemption has been extended by the Court under paragraph (b), the Court shall not further extend the period.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 91:
In page 28, to delete lines 10 to 20 and substitute the following:"(7) Subject to subsection (8) the Court shall not grant an exemption under subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that—(a) where the employer makes an application he or she has entered into an agreement with—(i) the majority of the workers,(ii) the representative of the majority of the workers, or(iii) a trade union representing the majority of the workers, in respect of whom the exemption is sought, whereby the workers, the representative of the workers or the trade union, consents to the employer making the application, and to abide by any decision on the application that the Court may make, and(b) the employer’s business is experiencing severe economic difficulties.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 93:
In page 28, line 23, to delete "or their representatives" and substitute the following:", their representatives or a trade union representing the majority of the workers".
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 95:
In page 30, paragraph (a)(i), line 40, to delete “subparagraph (xxvi)” and substitute “subparagraph (xxvii)”.Section 17 amends the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to ensure that payments due to a worker, due to decisions of a rights commissioner or a determination of the Labour Court made under this Act, shall be treated as debts for the purposes of employees' rights on the insolvency of their employer.  It adds to a long list of debts in Acts that are covered by section 6(2)(a)  of the 1984 Act.  Since the publication of the Bill the Property Services Regulation Bill 2011 was enacted which contained a similar amendment to the 1984 Act.  Accordingly, as a consequence of the Property Services Regulation Act 2011, section 6(2)(a)(xxvi) of the Protection of Employees (Employers’ Insolvency) Act 1984 was introduced and has necessitated a consequential adjustment of the numbering of the subsections listed in section 17 of this Bill.  It is a technical amendment.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 96:
In page 30, paragraph (a)(ii), line 42, to delete “subparagraph (xxvii)” and substitute “subparagraph (xxviii)”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 97:

SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I move amendment No. 99:
In page 31, lines 8 to 13, to delete paragraphs (b) to (d) and substitute the following:"(b) in subsection (2)(b), by the substitution of “, (xxviii) or (xxix)” for “or (xxviii)”,(c) in subsection (2)(c), by the substitution of “, (xxviii) or (xxix)” for “or (xxviii)”, and(d) in subsection (9), in the definition of “relevant date”, by the substitution of “, (xxviii) or (xxix)” for “or (xxviii)”.”.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The amendment proposes the addition of a new section 19 that would result in a firm, in receipt of an exemption to pay the REA or ERO rates, from tendering for a public procurement contract as has been espoused.  There are already protections in the Bill to address the concerns that the amendment seeks to deal with.  First, as regards REAs, it will be a matter for the parties to the REA to determine whether an REA should have a provision for an ability and inability to pay clause.  Second, in respect of EROs and REAs, the Labour Court will be required to take into account whether, if granted, the exemption would have an adverse affect on employment levels and distort competition in the sector to the detriment of employers not party to the application but subject to the ERO or REA.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Provisionally on 5 July 2012.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	It is proposed that the Bill will come before the Seanad on 18 July 2012.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Yes.
