In future, JLCs will be permitted to set out a basic adult rate and two supplementary minimum rates.  This will subsequently reduce the number of rates while acknowledging the freedom of JLCs to establish two higher hourly rates based on length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned or the attainment of recognised standards or skills.  Sub-minimum rates expressed as fixed percentages of the adult basic rate will apply as in the case of the national minimum wage to employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  All other rates of pay will be agreed at firm level.  The effect of the proposed Sinn Féin amendment would be to remove the "sub-minima" elements from the scope of proposals for remuneration from a JLC with only the adult rates remaining.</p>, <p eid="para_417">On amendment No. 70, section 12 provides for a number of amendments that are required to the legislative provisions relating to the formulation of proposals for employment regulation orders by joint labour committees, including in relation to the principles and policies that should guide the formulation of such proposals on the fixing of remuneration and conditions of employment.  In this context, section 12 inserts into the 1946 Act a new section 42A(5) which clarifies the relationship between the adult wages rate that may be proposed by a JLC and the sub-minimum rates under EROs expressed as the same fixed percentage of the minimum hourly rate of remuneration as set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in respect of employees aged under 18 years, first time job entrants and employees undergoing training.  Specifically, subsection (5)(<i>d</i>) provides that proposals for EROs shall provide that a worker who has attained the age of 18 years and during normal working hours undergoes a course of study or training prescribed in regulations made by the Minister under section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 shall be remunerated at an hourly rate reduced to the percentage set out in sections 14, 15 and 16 of that Act.  The National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Prescribed Courses of Study or Training) Regulations 2000 sets down the comprehensive criteria a course of study or training must satisfy for the purposes of section 16 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  The criteria include that the duration of the course is for a minimum period of three calendar months, that the training enables the acquisition of skills and-or knowledge expected to enhance the work performance of the employee at the end of the course, and assessment and certification procedures.  In addition, a separate amendment proposed by the Minister will provide that proposals for employment regulation orders, EROs, may provide for a minimum hourly rate of remuneration and not more than two higher hourly rates of remuneration based on the standards and skills recognised for the sector concerned as well as the length of service in the sector or enterprise concerned which was contained in the published Bill.</p>]

[<p eid="para_421">We can come back to that, Chairman.</p>]
[<p eid="para_434">I am glad that I am not getting on the wrong side of Deputy Willie O'Dea.  By way of explanation, section 12 inserts a new section 42A into the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a joint labour committee, JLC, must have regard when formulating proposals to submit to the Labour Court for employment regulation orders, EROs.  These principles and policies are set out in section 42A(6)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>d</i>) of the Bill.  This amendment proposes to require a JLC to take account of rather than have regard to such principles and policies.  On the advice of the Attorney General, the Government has agreed that the catalogue of principles and policies contained in sections 5, 11 and 12 should be developed to provide for a more explicit ordering of their priority ranking, and Government amendments are proposed.  In this regard, when formulating proposals for EROs, a priority consideration for a JLC is that the terms of the recommendation would promote harmonious relations between workers and employers and avoid industrial unrest.</p>, <p eid="para_435">The Minister has put forward separate amendments to these sections to deal with the necessity for providing for a hierarchy of principles in this regard.  Such a hierarchy of principles is needed not least in anticipation of further legal challenge to address tensions between constitutional issues, that is, freedom of contract and property rights on the one hand and the common good, that is, harmonious industrial relations on the other.</p>]

Section 42A(6) as presented provides that a JLC must have regard to, among other factors, the general level of wages in comparable sectors, including, where appropriate, the general level of wages in such comparable sectors in other relevant jurisdictions.  The objective of amendment No. 73 is to ensure that comparisons of minimum wages for the purposes of framing EROs would take account of differences in price levels between European Union member states reflecting purchasing power parities for household consumption expenditure.</p>, <p eid="para_444">While particular attention had been given to providing that wage comparisons, having regard to the rates paid in other jurisdictions, should only be conducted on the basis of a "fair and reasonable assessment", the parliamentary counsel's advice in respect of the provisions in sections 5 and 12 was that the specific concerns raised in this regard could best be addressed by specifying instead, first, the cost of living and, second, a restriction of the field of comparison to only those EU member states with which firms covered by JLCs and registered employment agreements, REAs, can be found to be in competition, and that they should be included as factors to be assessed in setting wages.</p>, <p eid="para_445">A similar provision as regards wage comparisons has been addressed already in subsection 3B(<i>k</i>) inserted by amendment No. 3, which I understand has been agreed.  Accordingly, comparisons are only applicable where firms covered by JLCs can be found to be in competition with enterprises in other EU member states.  The European Union has developed a model of economic and social development which extends beyond the diversity of national situations and is based on common values and principles, in particular, the objective affirmed in the treaty of promoting hand in hand economic and social progress.</p>, <p eid="para_446">EU member states have already ratified a large number of ILO conventions relating in particular to core labour standards, labour inspection, labour administration, employment, social security and wages.  Most EU member states currently have statutory or otherwise legally binding or generally applicable minimum wages in place.  The impact of a national minimum wage on both demand and supply can differ markedly across member states depending on the level set as well as other labour market policies and institutions.  The thrust of EU employment policy is that wage floors need to be sufficiently adjustable with the social partners actively engaged in ensuring wage settlements reflect overall economic developments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_449">I believe the issue was also raised with regard to an earlier amendment as we debated this particular issue.  If I am not mistaken the Minister, Deputy Bruton, gave an undertaking to examine it.  We feel taking the cost of living into account and restricting the field of comparison to only those EU member states with firms covered by JLCs and REAs is an equitable way forward.  I am trying to understand the Deputy's point in respect of employers but, respectfully, I did not quite understand the point made on how they are given a greater role.</p>]
[<p eid="para_451">The Deputy proposes to apply more qualitative criteria to the process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_453">The Government feels the criteria are well met and that the JLCs sit above the national minimum wage in any sense.  I do not think we should look for increased criteria above the level of wages.  This is the Government's view on the matter.</p>]
[<p eid="para_477">The stark political reality in regard to the national minimum wage is that this Government restored it.  We brought many people back into a wage that, arguably, is more of a living wage than those who served in previous mandate sought to have available given that it reduced their rights and entitlements.  We must take that into account as well.</p>, <p eid="para_478">I refer to the amendments and to section 42A(7).  This amendment provides for a new commonsense or straightforward definition of remuneration for the purposes of formulating proposals for EROs so that such proposals may no longer include pay or time off from work in lieu of public holidays; compensation pursuant to section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, resulting for required work on a Sunday, a section that will continue to apply separately and should not be duplicated in any ERO; payments in lieu of notice; or payments referrable to a worker's redundancy.  This amendment would include these provisions in the definition of remuneration.  This definition is provided in order to comply with the Government's decision that in future JLCs will no longer set Sunday premium rates or any other conditions of employment already covered by universal standards provided for in existing legislation.  In particular, provision for a Sunday premium will be removed from the scope of EROs while preserving workers' entitlements under section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  In this context, it is proposed to complement the removal of the Sunday premium from the purview of JLCs with a direction to the Labour Relations Commission to devise a code of practice for Sunday working.  The proposed code would provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives, in sections covered by EROs, on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options as specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The code of practice will subsequently be given formal status by means of a ministerial order.</p>]
[<p eid="para_485">To reiterate, section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides protection.  If we are talking about the status of the EROs, what is their status post July and post the High Court?  One must ask oneself that question.  What we are seeking to do through this legislation is to give a protection through the proposed code which at least provides guidance in respect of sectors covered by the EROs on arrangements that could be put in place to comply with section 14 of that very same Act.</p>, <p eid="para_486">I refer to those workers who would have had certain premia prior to July.  The question we must ask ourselves is where the evidence is of people bringing cases to rights commissioners post July, where they would have recourse to do so?  We have to find a mechanism here and we believe strongly that the LRC approach, with the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, provides the best way forward in terms of the protection of those workers.</p>]

It is proposed that in such circumstances, the chairman will be allowed to cast a single vote, having regard to the recommendation of the Labour Court, but not "a second or casting vote" as provided for in the new section 42B(9).

[<p eid="para_583">The amendment proposes the addition of a new section 19 that would result in a firm, in receipt of an exemption to pay the REA or ERO rates, from tendering for a public procurement contract as has been espoused.  There are already protections in the Bill to address the concerns that the amendment seeks to deal with.  First, as regards REAs, it will be a matter for the parties to the REA to determine whether an REA should have a provision for an ability and inability to pay clause.  Second, in respect of EROs and REAs, the Labour Court will be required to take into account whether, if granted, the exemption would have an adverse affect on employment levels and distort competition in the sector to the detriment of employers not party to the application but subject to the ERO or REA.</p>]
