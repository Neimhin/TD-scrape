SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter.  My primary concern is with the workers facing uncertainty today.  Taking account of the domestic economy, Aviva has decided to review its operations to ensure its capacity is in line with domestic demand to ensure sustainability.  Industry figures show that general insurance has fallen by more than 20% in the past two years, while life insurance and pensions have fallen by more than 30%, due to concerns over long-term savings and people cancelling or reducing pension policies.  Aviva has stated it is committed fully to Ireland and is currently in discussions with unions representing staff about the review.  Until this review has been completed, it would be premature to speculate about the outcome.  To be fair, it is pertinent that the Government allows the unions to engage with Aviva to see where that process might go.As for the role of the IDA, the Deputy has greater knowledge than me in this regard and is well aware that it supports multinational companies predominantly trading outside Ireland or internationally.  As part of its business in working to attract international activities into Ireland from multinational companies, the IDA has been in contact with Aviva at both corporate and local levels.  The Minister has asked the IDA, given its knowledge of the company, to continue to work with it to mitigate any possible negative outcomes.  Consequently, the IDA has been active in this regard.Ireland has succeeded in building an international financial services industry that is diverse in the activities carried out and which enjoys a world-leading reputation in several sectors.  While the past three years have represented a severe stress test for all the financial centres, firms at the International Financial Services Centre have shown resilience and flexibility.  Employing 33,000 people directly and many more indirectly, the IFSC remains both critical as an employer and as a centre of economic activity.  The goal of ensuring that jobs and economic activity are protected is a mainstay for the Government and I ask that Members allow further review to take place and for the discussions to conclude with the unions representing the staff.  The Government undoubtedly will engage at a later point.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Yes, certainly.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I acknowledge the Deputy's statement.  There is no sense of complacency on the part of the Government on this issue.  We must have regard to the fact the Cabinet has asked the IDA, given its knowledge of the company, to continue to work with it to mitigate any possible negative outcomes.Let us be frank.  I can dance around the language of redundancies and job losses but if a multinational company that transcends many boundaries has decided the course of action it will take, it is difficult for Governments to influence decisions.  Nobody wants job losses but sometimes decisions are made in other centres, financial powerhouses and capital cities other than Dublin.The key point is for us to engage with the company and try to move it from its current trajectory in terms of job losses.  We will do everything we can in that respect.  If the company makes a decision God or man will not shift it.  We should be honest and frank about the discourse.  We must try to ensure the same situation as TalkTalk does not arise and there is an early warning system that ensures we can engage with a company to try to stem the flow of job losses and learn valuable lessons to ensure the policy is tapered to have the right mix of companies.I will engage further with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The Deputy's comments are on the record of the House and I will relate them to the Minister and the IDA.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Seán Sherlock)	None	The Teaching Council recently carried out a survey of post-primary schools to ascertain the qualifications of maths teachers.  The results of the survey show that a significant majority of teachers — 68% — teaching maths in 258 schools are fully qualified to do so, that 29% have pursued some studies in maths and that only 2% have not obtained third level qualifications or pursued studies in maths.  The Teaching Council has asked schools which have not completed the earlier survey to do so by 26 September.Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics is of key strategic importance to the State.  As part of the Government's overall strategy to improve the teaching and learning of maths in schools, my Department is making arrangements for the provision of a new training programme for maths teachers.  This will provide unqualified maths teachers with the opportunity to upskill their knowledge of mathematics and study the strategies best suited to the new Project Maths syllabuses.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	To give the Deputy a straight answer, I am not in a position to do this.  As he is well aware, the boards of management of schools have autonomy in respect of who they hire and fire.  There is an issue of governance in that regard.  I ask the Deputy to have faith in the process being undertaken.  We must obtain the results of the survey and analyse them.  As announced on 12 September, a programme that will allow for continuing education and continuing professional development, CPD, for unqualified maths teachers is to be rolled out.  The contract in this regard is due to go to tender shortly.  I would be cautious with regard to the Department exercising control over decisions made by individual schools.  Again, I ask the Deputy to have faith.  We will analyse the results of the survey and proceed cautiously.  There must be an outcome which ensures teachers are properly qualified and that students obtain good results in their examinations.  In that context, we must seek to ensure there is a deeper engagement in this matter.  We will not turn the ship around overnight; it is going to take some time to do this.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Is the Deputy referring to the teaching of maths?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I ask that the Deputy table a separate parliamentary question on that matter.  This question relates to the teaching of maths.With regard to Deputy Smith's question, there are no exact figures for the take-up of CPD.  However, I will endeavour to come back to him at a later date with additional information on the matter.  If he is asking whether I am satisfied with the rate of reply to the survey, the straight answer is that I am not.  The schools have until 26 September to provide responses to it.  I ask the Deputy to have some forbearance and allow us to assess the position at that point.  The Department and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, are extremely conscious of the fact that we must grapple with this issue.  We must do so on the basis that we will be provided with a true picture of the actual scenario.  In that context, the agencies and stakeholders involved have been given a clear signal to the effect that we require sound data.  We cannot make proper policy decisions unless such data which must be both qualitative and quantitative are forthcoming.  I hope the Deputy will accept my comments on this matter in good faith.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	In relation to concerns regarding the teaching of mathematics, I expect to receive shortly full figures from a Teaching Council survey of the qualifications of mathematics teachers in second level schools. Initial indications from the schools which have responded, approximately one third, are that some 68% of maths teachers are fully qualified to do so, 29% have undergone some studies in maths and 2% have no third level qualifications/studies in maths. A tender to provide a post-graduate course to the last two groups is due to issue shortly.On the question of standards, I am not happy with the level of uptake at higher level mathematics.  Project Maths which was introduced in all schools in September 2010 aims, inter alia, to increase uptake at higher level.  I note that the uptake of higher level at junior certificate level was 52% among candidates who sat Project Maths in the Project school as opposed to 45.6% nationally.  This is a positive trend.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	As the Deputy is aware, Project Maths is a major programme of reform in mathematics in second level schools, which is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics.Project Maths began in 24 project schools in September 2008.  Strands 1 and 2 began in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at Leaving Certificate and 2013 at Junior Certificate. Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011, and strand 5 will start in 2012.In Leaving Certificate 2011 candidates in the Project schools had, at ordinary and higher levels, a higher proportion at A/B/C grades, and a lower proportion at E/F/NG.  Trends in relation to candidates who sat Project Maths at Junior Cycle in 2011 broadly mirror those of the Leaving Certificate Project Maths candidates.I am heartened to note a higher level take up rate of 52% among Project School candidates which compares favourably to the national rate of take up of 45.6% at Junior Certificate.
