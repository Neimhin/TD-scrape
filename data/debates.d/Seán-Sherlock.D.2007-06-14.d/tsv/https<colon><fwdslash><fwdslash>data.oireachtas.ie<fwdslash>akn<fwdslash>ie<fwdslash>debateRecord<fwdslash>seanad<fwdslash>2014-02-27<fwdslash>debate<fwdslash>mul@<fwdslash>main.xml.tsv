SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-02-27T12:20:00+00:00	Tá mé ag labhairt inniú ar son an Aire Stáit Mhic Fhionnlaoich a bhfuil aiféala air nach féidir leis a bheith i lathair de bharr go bhfuil sé ar ghnó eile. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is the principal Department charged with island development by supporting the improvement of infrastructure and assisting with the provision of essential services. The Department subsidises lifeline transport services for inhabited offshore islands. These comprise passenger and cargo ferry services, with a connecting bus service where necessary. In addition, the Department subsidises an air service for the three Aran Islands, which includes Inis Mór, under a public service obligation contract. In this regard the Department also subsidises a management service for the aerodromes based on these islands. In all, the Department subsidises transport services for 19 offshore islands in counties Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Cork. These services provide safe, all-year round transport services for the islands involved, thereby improving the quality of life for islanders and supporting sustainable island communities as well as promoting island tourism. Expenditure on these services was €5.9 million in 2013. The same allocation is available in 2014. The contract for the subsidised passenger ferry service for Inis Mór came to an end on 31 January 2013. The Department sought tenders through a public tendering process, as it does with all its subsidised services, for a further five year contract until 31 January 2018, but received no tender within the deadline set. In the absence of a tender, officials from the Department held discussions with the ferry operator that had been providing the contracted service to explore the possibility of entering into a new contract for the service on the same terms as the previous contract. Unfortunately, these discussions were unsuccessful as the Department could not accept the operator's claim for a substantial subsidy increase on a service that is, by all accounts, profitable without a subsidy. The Department understands that the operator continued to provide the service at the same level since the end of the contract with the State but that the fares payable by island residents were increased. I understand tsome uncertainty has recently arisen regarding the continuation of the service at the current level. A representative of the operator met my Department and indicated that circumstances for the company have altered and that it cannot guarantee it will be able to continue operating as previously. Officials also met representatives of the island co-op and the Minister of State is aware of their concerns about the current situation. The Minister of State would like to make it clear to the Senator that he is open to undertaking any reasonable steps that would assist in finding a resolution to meet with the requirements of all parties. Any steps the Department might take must fall within public procurement regulations and be achievable within the resources available to it. There are no plans at present to readvertise this contract as the Department does not have in its possession any evidence to indicate that the outcome of another public tendering process would differ dramatically from that which took place towards the end of 2012. As the Senator will appreciate, it is incumbent on the Minister of State to ensure public money is spent in the most cost-effective manner and achieves the maximum return for the State. The Department cannot justify subsidising a service if such subsidy is not warranted.I assure the Senator that efforts will continue to ensure there will be a regular passenger ferry service to the island at reasonable cost throughout the year and Department personnel are always available for discussion.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-02-27T12:30:00+00:00	I acknowledge the Senator's contribution. I know the Minister will make himself available to seek a resolution to the matter. I will convey to him the Senator's contribution.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-02-27T12:30:00+00:00	I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. As a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Skills and being from Cork, I am very much aware of the issue at hand. I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it offers us the opportunity to clarify the current position on the proposed amalgamation and reconfiguration of primary schools on the north side of Cork city. I advise the Senator that we are aware that a consultation process has been initiated involving North Presentation primary school, St. Vincent's girls' primary school, Scoil Mhuire Fatima - or North Mon primary school - and Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers. As the Senator may be aware, the initiative for any amalgamation or reconfiguration of schools may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, boards of management and patrons. Any such proposal must involve consultation with all of the relevant stakeholders and follow decisions taken at local level. In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of parents, teachers and local communities, which is a key point, and contributes to an inclusive education system. It is a matter for the relevant school authorities, including the parents and school community, to arrive at a satisfactory outcome. I confirm that although the decision making authority for the amalgamation of any school belongs to the patron of the schools concerned, such a proposal is then subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. With regard to the primary school amalgamation and reconfiguration being proposed, I understand details of this proposal has recently been sent to the boards of management, staff and parents of the four schools involved. It is understood that when the consultation process is concluded, the trustees of the schools concerned will make a recommendation to the patron for his decision in the matter. In that regard, I confirm that to date the Minister has not received any proposal from the patron or trustees in the matter.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to clarify the current position.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-02-27T12:30:00+00:00	It is very difficult to answer that question as there is a certain amount of theory involved. If no proposal has been received by the Minister to date, this is still very much a localised process. With regard to who is the patron, I would have thought the answer could be divined through the various schools involved in the process. In the absence of any application, correspondence or proposal to the Department or Minister, it could be argued that we are blind to any proposal. Therefore, notwithstanding the level of public sentiment expressed at the public meeting about the process, no clarification or correspondence has been provided to us either at a political or departmental level. We await such correspondence, should it arise. The question of the patron remains to be answered and perhaps I can provide assistance to the Senator in due course.
