SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Quinn Insurance Limited arrived in an insurance market inhabited by an old boys' network.  Quinn Insurance Limited opened up the sector and that is to be welcomed.  What comes across in the submissions is that the Quinn Group is hungry for new business and this means new jobs in the regions we are talking about.  I represent Cork East, in which Fermoy is located.  I visited the branch in the Eastgate Business and Retail Park in Cork.  Quinn Group employees have massive loyalty to the group and having a coterie of loyal employees means people want to strive for new business.  I realise the constraints on us because of the difficulty in making a direct political intervention as a result of the new culture with regard to the regulatory framework.  However, facilitating the Quinn Group making its case means that the regulator is listening.  I have a particular interest in Quinn Healthcare.  I would like to get a sense of the permutations of today's announcement and what this means within other businesses in the Quinn Group.  Quinn Healthcare is a highly profitable business and has slaughtered many sacred cows in terms of the old boys' network that existed within that business.  It continues to have to pay €39 million per year to keep another company afloat.  Will today's announcement have an impact on other businesses in the Quinn Group?  It would be a shame if the current system had a negative impact on other businesses.  That would be unnecessary and is preventable.
