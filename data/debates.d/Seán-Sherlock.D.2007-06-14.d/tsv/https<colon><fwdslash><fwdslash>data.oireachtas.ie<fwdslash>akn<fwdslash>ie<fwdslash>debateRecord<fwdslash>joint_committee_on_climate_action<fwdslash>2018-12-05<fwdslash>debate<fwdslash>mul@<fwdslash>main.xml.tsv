SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister. He has been very open and engaging. I perceive from him a sense of energy regarding what needs to be done here. With that in mind, is the all-of-Government approach modelled on a Cabinet sub-committee whereby all the line Departments will report directly to the Taoiseach via the Minister's Department?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	My view, bearing in mind that I was involved in the action plan for jobs with the Minister, is that having clear metrics to be measured and clear targets is the only way to reach milestones. We now need to start reaching serious milestones. If it is perceived that the mechanism in question is one by which people turn up without identifiable actions, right down to the micro level, it might fail.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	May I ask about carbon budgeting as a tool? The Minister spoke highly of the intervention of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt. Is is envisaged that carbon budgeting will be used as a tool by line Departments to ensure a decarbonisation agenda? Representatives of the IPCC who were before the committee spoke about the successful application of carbon budgets. They gave the example from France. Is it being considered here as a tool?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	Do we have a timeline for those? Perhaps the Minister could report back even if he does not have one now.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	If we are to reflect accurately the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly in producing our own report, carbon budgeting will be one of the areas-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:20:00+00:00	Indeed. We would welcome any move towards that. The Minister gave very specific examples, including on market failure and regulatory frameworks. I am sure he is interested in ensuring the deep retrofitting of buildings, including public buildings, private dwellings and schools. We had very positive engagement with the Tipperary Energy Agency. I believe strongly that if the Minister were to visit Nenagh and speak to staff in the agency, he would note three bespoke examples. One is a primary school, one is a municipal health centre and the third is a house. The Tipperary model is a very good stakeholder model based on a social enterprise model. If the Minister could engage on replicating it regionally or right across the country, it would be possible to use the carbon fund, and also possibly the green fund, in a way that would allow a financing instrument to bring the model to fruition.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-05T15:30:00+00:00	The SEAI is an agency of the Minister's Department. I respectfully ask him to examine the Tipperary model and kick the tyres in that regard. It is an excellent model. The other point relates to the just transition. If the Minister cannot respond now, he can come back to me. The language of the just transition has gained serious traction. It refers to fairness for workers who are moving into a decarbonised society to ensure that there are supports and social protection-type structures put in place so that the transition is just. This matter has been discussed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. Will the Minister consider engaging with ICTU to see if funding similar to that available in Spain and other countries could be put in place? In the mining industry in Spain, for example, a â‚¬250 million fund was put in place to assist workers who are getting out of the sector. I am merely putting this on the agenda for further discussion, perhaps offline.
