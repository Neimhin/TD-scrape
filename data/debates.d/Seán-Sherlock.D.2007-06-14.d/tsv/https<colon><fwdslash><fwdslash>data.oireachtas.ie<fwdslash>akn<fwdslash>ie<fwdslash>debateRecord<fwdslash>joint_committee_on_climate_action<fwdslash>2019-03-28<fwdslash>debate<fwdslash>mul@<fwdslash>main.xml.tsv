SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T15:20:00+00:00	As is the case in these matters, one is trying to arrive at a common position to seek to find some sort of compromise, for which one seeks to find a majority or a consensus. While we are talking technically about amendments that are on the table to be agreed or voted upon, the Labour Party has two very specific amendments Nos. 26 and 27. On the basis of the agreed text that has now come forward - agreed by the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party, we are now happy to withdraw our amendments. We feel that the proposal of the compromise for mechanisms to be put in place to look at how carbon taxes would affect those people in fuel impoverished houses - and that a mechanism is put in place so the most vulnerable people are protected - means we can sign up to this. At this stage, I am quite happy to withdraw amendments No. 26 and 27.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T15:50:00+00:00	The wording is clear that the Government should, prior to the introduction of any increase in carbon taxation, examine the impacts on low-income families and, on the basis of these findings, introduce specific policy measures to assist those who may not be in a position to immediately transition from fossil fuels, including the potential use of social protection mechanisms such as tax credits and welfare payments. Carbon tax is in existence and yields approximately €400 million but that €400 million goes to the Exchequer. This committee is seeking to ring-fence moneys collected from the tax so that retrofitting can be done and we can transition from carbon to meet our targets. If we agree to this amendment the Government would conduct a review, to be completed by June 2019, of what may be the most appropriate measure and what is the nature and extent of fuel poverty across all cohorts. We are building into the amendment a set of measures that seeks to protect the most vulnerable but ensures that we do not move until the review has been done. June 2019 may be too short a timeframe and it may need to be pushed out to July. It is important that we study what is in the amendment first, before we draw any conclusions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T16:00:00+00:00	I would like to be helpful to Deputy Smith. How will the Chairman proceed technically with that amendment?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T16:40:00+00:00	On a technical point, if Deputy Smith's amendment is as she put to the committee, is she now amending her own amendment that she has tabled?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T16:50:00+00:00	My understanding from Deputy Bríd Smith's earlier intervention was that she wants this to be a stand-alone recommendation, and it will presumably be pressed as such. The issue now before us is that the text of the stand-alone amendment that Deputy Bríd Smith has put forward seems to have changed, and subsequently additional wording must be brought forward to reflect the amendment she seeks to have as a Standing Order.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T16:50:00+00:00	I do not want to say anything in the absence of the proposer of the amendment except that I have no problem with her putting forward her amendment because she is amending it herself.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T17:00:00+00:00	I made a point about June 2019. We voted on the amendment. Has that been changed to July?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T17:00:00+00:00	I thought that was agreed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T18:00:00+00:00	Who is to say we will vote against the amendment? I say put it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T18:00:00+00:00	The Deputy has made the case for her amendment and it is now 6 p.m. on Thursday.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-03-28T18:10:00+00:00	I do not want anybody to mischaracterise the role of the advisers in this process. I want to be very clear that they have played an extremely beneficial role. Had it not been for my own, Anja Murray, I would have been at a serious loss in the work the committee has done.I do not want people to have the impression that the advisers were anything less than courteous and professional and that they sought to work together even when there were significant differences of opinion in respect of policy issues.
