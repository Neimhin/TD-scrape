SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue.  A number of points have been raised in each of the contributions.  I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to respond.  I am concerned at the continuing situation at the Vita Cortex factory in Cork which has involved workers at the plant engaging in a sit-in since 16 December last arising from a dispute with their employer over redundancy payments.  The workers involved in the Vita Cortex sit-in are seeking severance terms of 2.9 weeks per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, in line with previous redundancy deals at the company, and they maintain this will amount to a total of €1.2 million.  We know that the workers had been offered a paltry sum of €1,500 to leave the premises over the Christmas period and they rightly rejected this offer claiming that the company would use their absence to remove important machinery and stock.The company stated that it informed workers that their redundancy would have to come from the State's social insurance fund unless NAMA agreed to release €2.5 million held on deposit by another Vita Cortex firm on foot of an Allied Irish Banks, AIB, loan taken over by NAMA.  However, NAMA issued a statement that these funds were put out of reach of the Vita Cortex group not by NAMA but by AIB two and a half years ago when they were pledged as security for loans.  While NAMA has stated that it empathises with the Vita Cortex workers, it has stated that: "unfortunately legally it cannot simply use charged deposit funds pledged against loans of one company to meet costs incurred by a separate legal entity".  NAMA also stated that it is the responsibility of the owners and shareholders of Vita Cortex to resolve this situation.  It is difficult to disagree with that contention.  In the interests of achieving a resolution in this dispute, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, urged both parties to avail of the State's industrial relations machinery as soon as possible with a view to exploring ways of resolving the issues in dispute.Officials from my Department were in contact with the workers' union representatives over the holiday period, in an effort to clarify the issues involved and to make them aware that the industrial relations machinery of the State is available to help them resolve the dispute.  I understand that the Labour Relations Commission has today invited both parties to meet in Cork next Tuesday to clarify the facts and to explore with the parties the potential for moving forward.  I welcome the initiative by the LRC and urge both parties to engage constructively in the process.  Engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers the best way at this stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The ultimate aim is to ensure that the rights of workers are vindicated.  We all have that interest at heart.  The second aim is to ensure that corporate social responsibility is adhered to and that there is some degree of corporate governance.  I agree with the Deputies on the perceived Byzantine structures of Vita Cortex.  We must also remember that Vita Cortex was a recipient of State funding.  It would be in the interests of this State to ensure that we can shine a light on those companies in some way.  If there is a mechanism through which a query can be made to the Director of Corporate Enforcement about the company structure, then I actively encourage people to use it.It is impossible to say at this stage what the premise of the discussions will be.  The LRC extended the invitation just today and I hope that both parties will agree to engage in that process.  We should see where we can go from there.  Other points were raised in respect of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation meeting with both sides and with company management.  I will take back those points to the Minister.We need to ensure that the State will use its force in a positive sense to ensure that workers' rights are vindicated.  We are not going to rest on that-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I acknowledge the point made by Deputy Martin about the legal basis of NAMA's position.  I will also bring that to the Minister.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	No one political entity in the House has a monopoly on the rights of workers.  I spoke with regard to the Vita Cortex case, in which there is a serious breach of corporate social responsibility and corporate governance, and the same applies in respect of this case.  There is no question but that the rights of workers have not been vindicated and have been trampled upon.  Under legislation from 1977 to 2007 governing the protection of employees, a number of provisions deal with an information and consultation process that must be entered into prior to any redundancies being implemented and the provision of information to employees and to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In this case, the Minister has not received any statutory notice of such redundancies.  That is a serious breach in the first instance.  There is a need for my Department to engage with Mr. Meegan and others of Mandate who, it is reported met KPMG today.  I would like to get an assessment of what transpired at that meeting because the points raised on this and the previous Topical Issue matter go to the heart of industrial relations policy and vindicating the rights of workers.  As a Government, we must ensure there are no precedents set and the legislation is adhered to by corporate entities, individuals and citizens.  There is no question that we support the rights of workers as set down in legislation and will seek to do so.By way of being helpful, I express my willingness to meet workers representatives on this issue in order that we can provide some degree of assistance where possible.  I am keeping my statement brief because I realise Members will wish to make further submissions.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I acknowledge the points made by the Deputies and I am not one to pay lip service to issues such as this.  With respect, I have indicated that I want to meet the workers' representatives on this issue.  I am concerned, as Deputy McDonald has pointed out, that there is a perceived breach of legislation.  There is a perceived breach of legislation in respect of sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 and Regulation 6 of the European Communities (Protection of Employment) Regulations whereby employees, whose employer has not complied with sections 9 and 10 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, may refer complaints to a rights commissioner.  There are issues around the mandatory notice to employers.  Please allow me that mode of communication and let us see how we can proceed.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise. The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal.The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet society service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability.In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment.In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, inter alia, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 and 307 together.The Statutory Instrument is being finalised with a view to introduction this month.I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise.

I am extremely grateful to those interested parties and groups who responded. Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved. Broadly speaking, individual copyright holders and rights holders organisations supported the amendment in principle, with some arguing for stricter measures. The various elements of the communications industry who responded were mostly opposed.  Other contributors were concerned with the protection of fundamental rights in the digital environment and some feared for the freedom of the net.Legal opinion and closely argued legal positions which were submitted in the course of this process were referred to the Office of the Attorney General for consideration.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The EU Directive 2001/29/EC was transposed into Irish law by means of  the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.  While the Act preceded the Directive, most of the Directive's provisions were known at the time and incorporated into the legislation.The outstanding provisions were transposed by S.I. No. 16 of 2004 European Communities (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2004.For the avoidance of  any doubt as to the transposition of one of the provisions of the directive, i.e. injunctions against intermediaries as set out in Article 8(3) of the directive, a further Statutory Instrument is planned to restate Irish law in this regard.
