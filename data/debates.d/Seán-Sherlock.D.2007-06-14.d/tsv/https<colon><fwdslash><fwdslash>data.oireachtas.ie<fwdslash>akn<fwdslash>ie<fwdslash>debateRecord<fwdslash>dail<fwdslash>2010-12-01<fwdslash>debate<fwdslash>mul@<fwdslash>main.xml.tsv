[<p eid="para_517">Will the Minister clarify his reply?  Did I interpret him correctly when he said there is no impediment to the process but it would be subject to an EU Commission proposal?  Is there a clause in the agreement that resulted in the closure of the industry, which says that no sugar beet should be produced in Ireland up to 2017?  That needs to be clarified by him.</p>, <p eid="para_518">Has he regrets?  Does he now feel Government policy at the time was short-sighted in that even if we were not producing sugar, we could have used the sugar beet crop to produce ethanol to fulfil our obligations under the bio-fuels scheme and we would not have to import undenatured ethanol from third countries such as Brazil because we could blend it into stocks at Whitegate and produce an indigenous crop?</p>]
[<p eid="para_521">That reply is extremely disappointing but I do not want to make political hay out of this.  I accept what the Minister is saying in so far as Greencore, as the commercial entity responsible for processing sugar, stated it would renounce its quota but there is a disconnect between that and the political decision taken at Council of Ministers level, to which Fianna Fáil was a party, to accept the restructuring package as it pertained to Ireland.  Will the Minister acknowledge that post-2015 we could grow sugar beet again in Ireland, if not to supply the confectionery market, to ensure we can meet our obligations under the bio-fuels scheme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_523">The Minister has not answered my question about the potential of the sugar beet crop in the production of ethanol.</p>]
[<p eid="para_526">The Minister is kicking to touch again.</p>]
[<p eid="para_529">This is the only forum I have to have my question answered.  I want the Minister to give an opinion on whether we can produce ethanol on an indigenous basis.  He is kicking to touch again.  That sums up this Government.</p>]
[<p eid="para_561">I welcome the Minister's response.  It is one of those issues where we need a broad political consensus for the final outcome.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is beginning to tie down the three options and is being specific about the second option.  I also welcome his statement on payments and upper ceilings for larger farms.  I acknowledge what the Minister is saying about potential capping and the need for further detail on that.</p>, <p eid="para_562">If Ireland is to go for the second option — I realise that it is early days in negotiations — and there is a basic rate envisaged in that for income support, how does the Minister envisage that this will work out in real terms?</p>]
[<p eid="para_575">I acknowledge the Minister's response with regard to capping and to the United Kingdom's position.  It is clear the British would be against a cap for reasons arising from their monarchy, the Queen's progeny and the amount of land they own.  Consequently, this would stand to reason.  However, I refer to the flexibility arrangements about which the Minister has spoken.  Does he refer to flexibility in the sense that there would be an envelope for Ireland regarding the greening aspect, whereby Ireland would have a degree of flexibility as to how it could spend such funds?  Alternatively, does he refer to a degree of flexibility for Ireland with regard to the overall envelope?  The Minister should clear this up.</p>]
[<p eid="para_577">That is reassuring.</p>]
[<p eid="para_598">Has the Minister read the article by Darragh McCullough and Caitríona Murphy in this week's farming section of the <i>Irish Independent</i>?  The article in question refers to a “€35.7m cut in the Department of Agriculture’s budget for REPS and the Agri Environmental Options Scheme (AEOS) next year”.</p>]
[<p eid="para_600">I apologise.  I can paraphrase the document.</p>]
[<p eid="para_602">The article, which suggests that the remaining €294 million in the Department's budget will cover just 9,000 farmers, gets to the nub of the issue.  The farmers in question need a response from the Minister.  I ask the House to forgive my ignorance when I say I did not follow what the Minister said, to be frank.</p>]
[<p eid="para_604">Can the Minister guarantee the future of the AEO scheme?</p>]
[<p eid="para_612">I appreciate the Minister of State's reply.  I accept that the laws of supply and demand are among the dynamics in this instance.  He said that "4% of sheep meat imports into Ireland last year came from New Zealand".  How does that translate in terms of monetary value?  I do not know if the Minister of State has those figures.  If he does not, I will accept it and suggest they may be forwarded to me in the near future.</p>]
[<p eid="para_645">I ask for clarification.  From where has the Minister derived the figure of the price of 26 cent per litre?  Is this the amount that would make it sustainable?  Is the Minister now saying that pre-2015 there is no possibility of subsidisation of beet growing for the production of ethanol?  Is he saying there would be no Government support for the production of ethanol from sugar beet?</p>]

[<p eid="para_1093">I welcome the Fine Gael motion, which the Labour Party supports.  In speaking on the question of political and economic stability, we have before us proposals by the European Commission in relation to co-ordination on economic governance issues.  What goes to the heart of this is the very existence of political and economic co-ordination on issues of a monetary nature.  Events in recent months have shown clearly that there is an existential crisis as regards the very existence of the euro.  As a result of the current crisis there are some who seek to impose on countries greater economic and political co-ordination in return for the continued existence of the euro.  In other words, the very threat we see to the euro at present, in the opinion of some people, is as a result of a lack of greater political co-ordination.</p>, <p eid="para_1094">My view is that if the Government of the day is to talk about greater political and economic co-ordination at a European level, we must be very honest with the people about that.  There is a choice now in this country as regards where we go.  Do we follow an intergovernmental model so that we may ensure our sovereignty, both economic and political, or do we go for a deeper co-ordination at European level and follow an intra-institutional model, whereby greater power is derived by the European Commission?  Instinctively in this country, because it is supposed to be a republic, there is a view to the effect that while greater economic co-ordination is necessary and we subscribe to the very existence of the euro, this should not be to the further detriment of our sovereignty.  We have now given away too much of that sovereignty along with our ability to be able to make and break our own fiscal and monetary policies.  There has to be a breakpoint which determines that this current crisis should not present itself as an opportunity by the European Commission as potential for deepening European integration so that the intra-institutional model wins out over the intergovernmental one.</p>, <p eid="para_1095">The plan that has been put before us, on which we will not be even entitled to vote, is a further kick in the teeth to the citizens of Ireland, who believe very strongly that they should have the ability through this House to decide as to its efficacy.  There is now a well-founded deepening suspicion that this crisis has presented itself as an opportunity by the European Commission and the intra-institutions to deepen their grip and to bring about a federal construct for the European Union.  I want to lay down a marker to the effect that any new Government must think carefully as regards where it wants to go and on its policy in relation to the European Union in this respect.</p>, <p eid="para_1096">Mine and future generations have been sold down the river, and deemed expendable in the greatest ever swindle to which the people of Ireland have been subjected as a result of the economic policies of this Government.  I note the presence on the Fianna Fáil benches of members of my generation, some of whom became Members of the Dáil around the same time as I did.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1099">I am speaking of the people of my generation.  While there is no blame apportioning to that generation of Fianna Fáil politicians, there is a sense that they do not appreciate the anger and sheer sense of betrayal among the public.  Some of the people of my generation on the Government benches are as vigilant as their elders in defending the party line and the sins of those who have gone before them, politically.  If this country is going to mean anything, I believe our generation of politicians will have to come clean with the people and begin a new political paradigm that ensures it will not be about serving Fianna Fáil or the party first, but rather the people, so that they are sovereign.  It is the people on whom we will rely to guide us in terms of how the country should be governed.</p>, <p eid="para_1100">It is deplorable that a deal of this magnitude could be brought in by a Fianna Fáil Government, which through pure chicanery knows it will not have to implement half of it and that a large part of the deal will be very difficult to unhinge for any incoming Administration.  That is the trick of the Fianna Fáil party and that is what it has done for generations.  There will be Fianna Fáil speakers of my generation tonight who will defend the position and the deal with great gusto, knowing full well that they will be on this side of the House in six months time when we will have to defend and do our best to renegotiate a deal into which the Government has manoeuvred us.  It is chicanery of the highest order.  That we cannot vote on this deal makes a mockery of the very sovereignty of this country, and of this House.</p>]
