[<p eid="para_6">The committee is in public session. Apologies have been received from Deputies Dara Murphy and Martin Heydon and Senator Colette Kelleher.</p>, <p eid="para_7">The usual rules will apply with regard to mobile phones. Mine is on airplane mode. In accordance with standing procedures agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for paperless committees, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated to members on the document database. I propose that we go into private session to deal with matters before returning to public session. Is that agreed? Agreed. </p>]
[<p eid="para_8">We are now in public session. The first petition is Petition No. P00045/2017. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_10">Is Senator Buttimer proposing a practical solution?</p>]
[<p eid="para_12">If a suggestion is coming from the Senator to the effect of communicating with the Minister for Justice and Equality seeking a direction on the point just made by the Senator, I would suggest that the secretariat do that if that is acceptable to the Senator.</p>]
[<p eid="para_14">The next petition is Petition No. P00009/18. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration is Petition No. P00032/18. It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition? Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_15">At a previous meeting, we considered the issue of the Ombudsman's Nursing Home Casebook. To help us to consider this matter further, I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health and older people at the Department of Health, Deputy Jim Daly. I advise any witnesses present to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system and will interfere with the broadcasting of the meeting.</p>, <p eid="para_16"> I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting. </p>, <p eid="para_17"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. It is perhaps ironic that I am reading this to somebody who is also a Member of the House but we must abide by the rules. I welcome the Minister of State. Perhaps he could give us a five-minute overview of his submission followed by a quick question-and-answer session and we can take it from there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_25">I thank the Minister.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">Please do.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">Would the Minister of State like to respond?</p>]
[<p eid="para_38">I thank the Minister of State. I have a few questions for him. He has spoken about future planning. As the population ages, housing solutions will need to have greater complexity. I am sure he will agree that the <i>modus operandi</i> will need to involve facilitating independent living as near as possible to the end of life. I wonder whether the space exists in the current housing crisis to think through the challenges we are facing with regard to the zoning of land, the housing policy of local authorities and the mapping of Government policy. I would like to get his perspective on that.</p>, <p eid="para_39"> My second question relates to residents of nursing homes whose houses are vacant. There has been some public discussion on the possibility of facilitating occupancy of those houses while people are in nursing homes. How stands that possibility? It could do a lot to help to solve the current housing supply crisis.</p>, <p eid="para_40"> The third issue I would like to raise relates to public nursing homes. There are some vacant beds in Fermoy Community Hospital. If hospital management personnel are seeking to hold beds for a greater level of acuity, I can understand that. The effect, in real terms, of HIQA bed management rules relating to the operational space for each bed has been to restrict the number of beds in wards that had a greater number of beds up to now. Has consideration been given to the capacity of nursing homes - particularly in the public sphere, where there is a shortage of beds at present - to provide a greater number of beds where there is serious demand?</p>]
[<p eid="para_43">That is significant.</p>]
[<p eid="para_45">How close are the Departments to making a decision?</p>]
[<p eid="para_47">Okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">My point related specifically to the HIQA bed management recommendations. As a result of new restrictions that have been put in place, a previous 16-bed ward in a community nursing home is now a 12-bed ward. I use those figures for the sake of argument. I note that Senators will have to leave because there is a vote in the Seanad. I thank Senators Buttimer and Wilson. I am not sure whether the HIQA recommendations I have mentioned are governed by statutory instruments.</p>, <p eid="para_51">I wonder whether there is flexibility. If demand increases, can we allow for greater flexibility within the current arrangements without going into large-scale capital expenditure for new beds and wards? Can we make use of current facilities and still allow for the dignity of the person and all of that to be preserved? Can we facilitate greater scope through bed management within the existing hospital structures or community hospital structures?</p>]
[<p eid="para_54">I have one final question regarding additional charges. I acknowledge the Minister of State is expecting the report from the interdepartmental working group. Can he be more specific on the timeframe for that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">It comes with a health warning.</p>]
[<p eid="para_58">I thank the Minister of State for attending and for engaging on the nursing home casebook. We are to meet with the various ombudsman offices shortly. We might allow for a further engagement as needs be if the Minister of State is willing further down the line.</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">That relates to the contractual arrangements.</p>]
[<p eid="para_62">I thank the Minister of State.</p>]
