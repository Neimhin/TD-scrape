[<p eid="para_510">My speech, along with the information pack containing supplementary documentation, has been circulated.</p>, <p eid="para_511"> I am pleased to bring the Companies Bill 2012 before the Seanad today. The Bill as presented represents a landmark legislative project, which is the result of many years of detailed and comprehensive work by officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Company Law Review Group and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is the largest substantive Bill in the history of the State, spread out over 25 Parts, 17 Schedules and comprising 1,436 sections.</p>, <p eid="para_512">We got through this in two days on Committee Stage in the DÃ¡il, and I hope that signals how it might be dealt with in this House. It was recognised at an early stage of the process that a mere consolidation of the existing Companies Acts would be too limiting in light of the reforms necessary to sustain Irish competitiveness with respect to company law. Instead, an overhaul and restructuring of the company law framework was embarked upon. The result is a Bill that provides a state-of-the-art framework for all businesses operating in Ireland, whether domestic or foreign and irrespective of size.</p>, <p eid="para_513"> The principal objective of the Bill is to restructure, consolidate, simplify and modernise company law in Ireland and in doing so improve Ireland's competitive position as a location for business investment. This reform seeks to ensure a balance between simplifying the day-to-day running of a business, maintaining the necessary protections for those dealing with companies, such as creditors and investors, and putting in place an effective corporate governance regime to ensure compliance. Any modernisation and reform of company law must be viewed against the backdrop of the fact that limited liability itself is a concession by the State to business, and must therefore be tempered by robust regulation to protect creditors' interests.</p>, <p eid="para_514"> In making company law more accessible, more coherent and more reflective of actual business practice, Ireland's international competitiveness will improve and ordinary businesses and companies throughout the country will find it easier to establish and operate. However, by simplifying the law and making it more intelligible, it is not intended to water down compliance. In fact if the law is more accessible, it is more likely to ensure respect and compliance.</p>, <p eid="para_515"> It is important to bear in mind that the last major review and consolidation of Irish company law was in the lead-up to the Companies Act 1963, more than 50 years ago. Since then there have been 17 amending Acts and 15 statutory instruments, which are required to be read as one with the principal Act. In that time, Ireland has taken on EU obligations on the harmonisation of laws, and this has inevitably added to the volume and complexity of Irish company law. Therefore, the Bill seeks to break company law down into distinct principles and areas and to remove or lessen the administrative burdens where possible and appropriate, bearing in mind that the public interest will sometimes require the introduction of additional regulation. These developments will bring Irish company law into the 21st century and ensure Ireland maintains a competitive edge as one of the best places in Europe, and indeed the world, in which to do business.</p>, <p eid="para_516"> The Bill is the culmination of 14 years of work by my Department and the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. The CLRG is a statutory body that was set up in February 2000 and includes all relevant stakeholder interests, with members from Departments, professional bodies representing solicitors, barristers and accountants, employer and trade union interests, and regulatory bodies. To date, the group has published 15 reports and these reports have been freely available on the CLRG website. By making these reports publicly available, the transparency of the CLRG's decision-making process is ensured and the reasoning behind any recommendations issued by the group can be analysed. Members of the public and interested groups have been free to make submissions to the CLRG and all such submissions are given due consideration.</p>, <p eid="para_517"> In advance of publication of the Bill to the Oireachtas, Volume 1 was published in draft form on my Department's website in May 2011. This afforded an opportunity to all interested stakeholders to familiarise themselves with the proposed new legislation, to interrogate it from a technical perspective and to prepare for its introduction. Submissions were welcomed and a number of the proposals were adopted in the Bill as published.</p>, <p eid="para_518"> Following publication of the Bill in December 2012, suggestions and observations regarding the Bill began to flow from company law users throughout the country. To date, in excess of 1,000 such suggestions have been received and each one has been subject to careful analysis by my Department. Many of these suggestions formed the basis of the amendments put forward during the Bill's passage through the Dail. In all, more than 400 amendments were carried during Committee and Report Stages. While this was a large volume, it is worth noting that these amendments did not seek to change either the policy or the structure of the Bill. The purpose of the amendments was generally to bring about technical and practical improvements. It is clear that the development of this Bill has, at every stage, involved extensive input from a wide variety of sources and I thank sincerely the members of the CLRG, as well as the many other individuals and groups, who have contributed to this hugely collaborative project.</p>, <p eid="para_519"> Turning now to the Bill itself, one of the striking features is the general structure it has adopted. For the first time in Irish company law, the most common company type, the private company limited by shares, is placed at the core of the legislation as the default company. By adopting this structure the Bill acknowledges the practical reality that almost 90% of the companies currently registered at the Companies Registration Office are private companies limited by shares. In addition the Bill rectifies the anomaly in the current legislation that presupposes that the public limited company, PLC, is at the centre of corporate life in Ireland. In reality fewer than 1% of companies are registered as PLCs. The result is that the architecture of the company law code is now recalibrated to reflect the true landscape of enterprise in the State. There is world of difference between the one person private company formed by a tradesperson and the large publicly listed limited company. To ensure greater accessibility to the new company law code, the Companies Bill is made up of two volumes. Volume 1, containing Parts 1 to 15, inclusive, sets out the law applicable to the most common company type in the State, the private company limited by shares - the new limited company, as it were. In keeping with the objective of ensuring the law is clearly accessible, the Bill is arranged to reflect the life cycle of the company, starting with the incorporation of a company, followed by matters pertaining to its operation and finally providing for the company's wind-down.</p>, <p eid="para_520"> Volume 2, which contains Parts 16 to 25, inclusive, and the Schedules, sets out the other types of company that can exist and how the law contained in Volume 1 is applied, disapplied or varied for each other company type. These other company types are the designated activity company, DAC, the public limited company, PLC, the guarantee company, CLG, the unlimited company, the unregistered company and the investment company. There are legitimate users of all the different company types set out in the Bill and it is imperative that Irish company law should facilitate all types of enterprise and the wider commercial community by making appropriate provision for these different company types.</p>, <p eid="para_521"> Returning to the new model private limited company, the Bill contains a number of significant innovations and reforms for this company type. First, this company type will have the same legal capacity as a natural person. The current <i>ultra vires </i>rule does not apply to this new company type. The <i>ultra vires </i>rule is the legal doctrine whereby a company must have what is known as an objects clause in its memorandum of association. Removing the need for an objects clause will both ease the administrative burden on companies and provide certainty to third parties, such as lenders, who will no longer have to examine extensive objects clauses to determine whether a company is acting within its powers. This company type will be allowed to have only one director. Under the current law, a company must have at least two directors and even if one person wishes to establish a business as a company on his or her own, he or she needs to find an additional person to act as the second director. Removing this requirement will make it easier to start a new business. The new limited company can have a minimum of one member and a maximum of 149 members. The 149 member upper limit is linked to the requirements of EU prospectus law, which governs the offer of shares to the public. The new limited company will have a single document constitution, in contrast to the current law whereby every company must have two documents, a memorandum of association and separate articles of association. The new limited company will no longer be obliged to go through the formality of holding a physical annual general meeting, AGM, where all the members have to convene in one location at the same time on an annual basis. Instead the members will be able to hold a written AGM, whereby all the matters which must be dealt with at the AGM can be approved by written procedure.</p>, <p eid="para_522"> The Bill contains a codified version of the fiduciary duties to which directors are currently subject by a combination of the common law and statutory provisions. This brings all of these duties together in a single identifiable place, making it easier for directors to understand their responsibilities and more difficult to deny their existence. This also addresses one of the recommendations of the Moriarty report on company law. The Bill contains what is known as a summary approval procedure, which is applicable to a number of activities, for example, the reduction of capital, which under the current law might require the company to undertake the burdensome and expensive process of securing court approval. The new summary approval procedure incorporates safeguards on directors' liability in circumstances where the procedure is used without proper justification. Additionally, there are a number of innovations which will apply to other company types. For example, Part 20 enables any company to convert from its existing company type to any other company type that can be formed under the Bill. This is in contrast to the current law which contains restrictions on conversions.</p>, <p eid="para_523">This provides flexibility and greater options to companies which face a change in their circumstances. For the first time, guarantee companies will be able to avail of the audit exemption. This innovation will be of significant benefit to the sectors which tend to use the guarantee company structure, for example companies in the voluntary sector, charities and residential management companies, while at the same time recognising the particular circumstances applying to guarantee companies in allowing a single member to object.</p>, <p eid="para_524"> Moving on from the key innovations, I now turn to the amendments passed by DÃ¡il Ãireann. As I mentioned earlier, a large number of amendments have been passed and, due to the volume, it is not possible to cover each one. However, I will briefly touch on some of the more significant.</p>, <p eid="para_525"> There is now an explicit prohibition on bearer shares. This will enhance Ireland's reputation as a country which is playing its part in the international movement against money-laundering. In a winding-up, company books and papers must be retained for six years, rather than three years, after the dissolution of the company. This brings Ireland in line with best practice internationally. It also makes it easier for authorities such as the Revenue Commissioners, or the ODCE, to investigate potentially fraudulent or criminal activity. There has been a significant increase in the minimum share capital thresholds for companies that wish to appoint restricted persons as a director.</p>, <p eid="para_526"> In addition to those measures designed to reduce white-collar crime, other amendments have focused on the modernisation and efficiency of company law. Such changes include permitting companies to use cloud computing solutions for keeping records; modernising some provisions regarding service of notice; and clarifying certain powers of directors upfront in the Bill in order to avoid every company having to change their constitution individually.</p>, <p eid="para_527"> I now turn to the substance of the Bill. Due to the unprecedented size of the Bill, it is not possible to give a detailed explanation for each of the 1,436 sections. Instead, I will give an overview of the 25 constituent Parts, along the way highlighting any significant changes to the law and explaining the policy behind these changes. The supplementary information provided to the Senators contains a more detailed overview at chapter-by-chapter level.</p>, <p eid="para_528"><b>
</b>Part 1 consists of 14 sections and is largely devoted to housekeeping. It sets out the structure and defines terms which are used throughout the Bill. Part 2 makes provision for the incorporation and registration of the new model private company limited by shares - the new LTD company - and provides that any one or more persons may form such a company. The most significant aspect of this Part is the provision for the conversion of an existing private company limited by shares to a new model private company limited by shares. If the company chooses to opt for the new regime, Schedule 1 sets out a template to assist them. Companies that do not elect to opt into the new regime will not be able to avail of the many advantages associated with the new model private company limited by shares, such as the ability to have only one director, the one document constitution and the possibility to avoid having a physical AGM. However, the new limited company will not suit all business activities. Therefore, a company is entitled to opt out of the new regime and can do so by converting to a designated activity company, or other company type.</p>, <p eid="para_529"><i>
</i>Part 3<i>
</i>consolidates all existing law relating to share capital, shares, and certain other instruments. At present, this law is set out across the three main Companies Acts. Many provisions from Table A of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1963 are today commonly inserted into the articles of association of a company. Under the Bill they are incorporated into its text and will, therefore, apply unless the company's constitution provides otherwise. This will reduce the amount of detail required in the constitution of the company and make it more business-friendly.</p>, <p eid="para_530"><i>
</i>Part 4 provides a framework for directors and other officers as regards their appointment, their interaction with the company and its members, and the ways in which the activities of the company are conducted on a day-to-day basis. This Part permits the new limited company to have a single director. It also allows such a company to dispense with holding an AGM, where agreed unanimously by the members. Provision is made for unanimous written resolutions, thus allowing a company to pass resolutions, including special resolutions, in writing.</p>, <p eid="para_531"> Part 4 also sets out the new summary approval procedure which deals with restricted activities such as the giving of financial assistance for the acquisition of shares, making reductions in company capital, or for varying company capital. This reduces the burden and expense on companies who previously may have had to secure court approval for certain transactions. Additionally, it simplifies and streamlines the current methods of effecting such transactions. To ensure balance, it incorporates safeguards in relation to directors' liability if the procedure is used inappropriately. Greater detail on the summary approval procedure is provided in the Senators' handouts.</p>, <p eid="para_532"> Part 5 codifies, for the first time in Irish law, all the duties of directors and other officers of the company. Up until now, these duties were to be found in the common law and in various statutory provisions. They are set out now, in their entirety, for the sake of clarity. It is expected that this innovation in company law will promote compliance with such duties by directors and company officers.</p>, <p eid="para_533"> Also dealt with in this Part is the directors' compliance statement, which is now being introduced into law as recommended by the CLRG and approved by Government in November 2005. These provisions apply to the majority of public limited companies and to large private limited companies. It places on obligation on directors to make an annual statement, in their directors' report, acknowledging that they are responsible for securing the company's compliance with its relevant obligations. This provides that directors confirm that certain actions have been done, or where they have not been done, explaining the reasons why. Failure to prepare a director's compliance statement will constitute an offence under the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_534"><i>
</i>Part 6 contains provisions regarding the accounting records to be kept by companies, the financial statements to be prepared by them, the periodic returns to be made to the Registrar of Companies and the auditing of financial statements. It also covers other matters related to auditors, particularly rules governing the appointment of statutory auditors and their removal from office. To a large extent, these requirements are unchanged from existing law. However, the relevant provisions have been redrafted in order to make them easier to understand and in order to improve compliance.</p>, <p eid="para_535"><i>
</i>Part 7 contains provisions regarding debentures and charges. It also introduces a number of changes to the current law, the purpose of which is to simplify the registration and de-registration of charges while clarifying the rules for the priority of charges. A new two-stage procedure for the registration of charges is proposed. It provides that an initial notice can be sent to the Registrar stating the intention of the company to create a charge, followed up by a further more detailed notification within 21 days of the creation of the charge, stating that fact. In this way, it is envisaged that lenders may be more willing to advance funds if they can achieve more certainty with regard to the priority of the secured assets. The rules governing the priority of charges have also been significantly changed. Where the priority of charges is not governed by other regulation such priority will be determined by reference to the date of receipt by the Registrar of Companies of the prescribed particulars.</p>, <p eid="para_536"><i>
</i>Part 8 deals with receivers. It substantially re-enacts the current law on receivership as contained in the Companies Act 1963, as amended. There are, however, some new provisions that set out the powers and duties of receivers. The receivers are now given certain specific powers in this Part, in addition to those conferred on them by court order or the instrument under which they were appointed. Conferring statutory powers on receivers is intended to alleviate many of the problems which arise from poorly drafted debentures.</p>, <p eid="para_537"><i>
</i>Part 9 contains provisions relating to the reorganisation, acquisition, merger and division of companies. The main innovation in this Part is the provision, for the first time in Irish law, of a statutory mechanism whereby two private Irish companies can merge. Therefore, the assets, liabilities and corporate identity of one, are transferred by operation of law to the other, before the former is dissolved. A further innovation is that a merger can be effected without the necessity for a High Court order. Where a merger meets the requirements of the legislation, it is proposed that the summary approval procedure can be utilised to effect the merger, which can be expected to result in a significant saving of time and money. The provisions dealing with divisions are also entirely new and have been drafted to mirror the corresponding provisions in this Part that deals with mergers.</p>, <p eid="para_538"><i>
</i>Part 10 contains the provisions regarding examinership. It largely reproduces the existing law on examinerships as contained in the 1990 Act and the recent 2013 Act which allowed small private companies to go to the Circuit Court for examinership.</p>, <p eid="para_539"> Part 11 reorders in a more logically coherent way the law relating to winding up. As a result, greater consistency has been introduced between the three different methods of winding up - members' voluntary, creditors' voluntary and court ordered. This is most evident in the changes to the court-initiated mode of winding up, which will reduce the court's supervisory role in favour of greater involvement for creditors. Further changes are the introduction of new professional indemnity insurance requirements for liquidators and the requirement for a person to be qualified before acting as liquidator of a company.</p>, <p eid="para_540"> Part 12 combines into one Part the many diverse provisions of the current law regarding the strike off and restoration of companies. The new provisions set out the reasons a company may be struck from the register and the procedures for restoration to the register. The Director of Corporate Enforcement will be empowered to require the directors of a company which is being struck off to produce a statement of affairs. These directors can then be required to appear before a court and answer on oath any question relating to the statement.</p>, <p eid="para_541"> Part 13 substantially re-enacts, without any significant amendments, the law regarding the appointment of inspectors to companies and seeks to codify all law relating to the investigation of companies. In keeping with the stricter approach to the enforcement of company law, Part 14 brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions, a change which will provide greater transparency. If a director applies for relief from a restriction order, the Director of Corporate Enforcement must now also be included as a notice party in any application for relief. A new provision is inserted whereby a company is prohibited from utilising the summary approval procedure where that company has a restricted director. Additionally, higher capitalisation is now required for companies with a restricted director. A new four-tier categorisation of offences is introduced. It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions in the case of the most serious offences, for example, prospectus and market abuse offences, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme. The Senators will find details of the scheme in their information packs. A further new provision has been introduced which provides that, following a conviction for an offence under this Bill, the court may order that the convicted person should remedy any breach of the Bill in respect of which they were convicted.</p>, <p eid="para_542"> Part 15 contains provisions relating to the Registrar of Companies, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Company Law Review Group. For the first time, the powers and duties of both the Minister and these bodies are brought together in one coherent group of legislative provisions.</p>, <p eid="para_543"> I now turn to Volume 2 of the Companies Bill, which Senators will recall sets out the other types of company that can exist and how the law contained in Volume 1 is applied, disapplied or varied for each other company type set out in Parts 16 to 24.</p>, <p eid="para_544"> Part 16 provides for a type of private company to be known as a designated activity company, DAC. There will be two types of DAC under the Bill - a private company limited by shares and a private company limited by guarantee, having a share capital. The primary defining feature of a DAC, although I do not know if DAC has worked its way into the popular parlance yet - we will call it a DAC-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_547">Senators heard it here first. The primary defining feature of a DAC will be the continued existence of an objects clause in the constitution of the company. It is envisaged that entities which would welcome the DAC include special purpose companies, for example, those incorporated for joint ventures or for use in a financing transaction. However, the Bill does not restrict the availability of DACs to persons engaged in such activities.</p>, <p eid="para_548"> Part 17 is concerned with public limited companies, PLCs. The key difference between public limited companies and private companies is that only PLCs will be permitted to list their shares on a stock exchange and offer them to the public. A PLC is now permitted to have as little as one member and there is no maximum number on the membership of such a company. A PLC must have at least two directors. A PLC is obliged to establish an audit committee, and corporate governance provisions for the majority of PLCs are set out in this Part.</p>, <p eid="para_549"> Part 18 provides for companies limited by guarantee, CLGs, not having a share capital. Since guarantee companies do not have a share capital, they are a popular type of company for charities, sports and social clubs and management companies. A CLG may be exempt from the requirement to use such a suffix to its name, for example, if it has a charitable object. The audit exemption is now being extended to guarantee companies under the Bill, if it fulfils the criteria for a small company. It is expected that this will benefit the many guarantee companies that are charities or sports clubs, etc. However, to ensure probity, any one member of the company is entitled to object to the exemption and thus force a company to carry out an audit.</p>, <p eid="para_550"> Part 19 provides for unlimited companies. This Part is structured in such a way that it covers both private unlimited companies and public unlimited companies. In this regard, three different types of unlimited companies are being catered for: the private unlimited company with a share capital, ULC, the public unlimited company with a share capital, PUC, and the public unlimited company that has no share capital, PULC. All three types of unlimited company exist already.</p>, <p eid="para_551"> Part 20 provides for re-registration of companies. A company will generally be permitted to re-register as another type of company subject to complying with the requirements applicable to the latter company type. Re-registration will involve the passing of a special resolution and the delivery of certain documents, including a compliance statement, to the CRO. Additional requirements may apply depending on the type of company following re-registration.</p>, <p eid="para_552"> Part 21 provides for the registration and disclosure requirements of external companies, also known as foreign companies or overseas companies, which have been formed and registered outside the State but which have a connection with Ireland. Existing law provides for both the concept of "place of business" and the concept of "branch". Under the Bill, however, the "place of business" is abolished and the law will provide only for the "branch" concept. By not retaining the concept of "place of business", it is hoped to remove the uncertainty in the current law and oblige external companies to register as a branch if appropriate and thus be required to file accounts.</p>, <p eid="para_553"> Part 22 deals with unregistered companies and joint stock companies and the application of the Bill to companies formed or registered under previous Acts. It also provides a mechanism for an unregistered company to register as a PLC. The most important unregistered company in Ireland is the Governor and Company of the Bank of Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_554"> Part 23 contains the provisions relating to prospectus law, market abuse law, and transparency law. In particular, provisions are set out regarding the consequences of a breach of a measure forming a part of any of these, and requiring a company with traded securities to prepare a corporate governance statement. For the sake of clarity, these provisions are housed in a stand-alone Part rather than in Part 17 which deals with PLCs.</p>, <p eid="para_555"> Part 24 provides for the establishment of companies as investment companies, currently provided for under the 1990 Act. To be permitted to operate, these companies must be authorised by the Central Bank. Such companies are a key constituent of the set of legal structures under which the international collective investment funds industry operates in Ireland. An investment company is a type of PLC.</p>, <p eid="para_556"> The final Part, Part 25, contains miscellaneous provisions that do not naturally fit in any of the preceding Parts, such as foreign insolvency proceedings, the prohibition on partnerships with more than 20 members and certain public auditor requirements.</p>, <p eid="para_557"> I am delighted with the significant benefits which the Bill will bring to all companies, big and small, throughout the country. It will make it far easier to run a business as a company and it will enhance Ireland's competitive position as a place to start and grow a business. I look forward to working with the Senators on progressing the Bill to enactment, and I believe it will bring significant benefits to companies and to business life in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_558">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>]
[<p eid="para_622">I have to catch a flight at 7 a.m. as well, so I thank the Senator for his indulgence.</p>]
[<p eid="para_638">I thank Members for the very precise nature of the points raised in their brief contributions. I will endeavour to answer all the points but if I do not do so tonight, I hope they will indulge me to respond to them on Committee Stage when I will have comprehensive answers.</p>, <p eid="para_639"> I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions to the debate on the Companies Bill 2012. I welcome the general expressions of support for the Bill. There were many positive contributions spanning across a range of issue in respect of the legislation, in particular with regard to the collaborative approach taken throughout the development of the Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_640"> Senator White referred to the importance of ensuring awareness of the new legislation and providing education to the business community on the changes and new requirements. The Companies Registration Office, CRO, will have a particularly pivotal role to play in the implementation phase of the new Bill and considerable progress is already under way in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_641">This includes company owners, formation agents, company secretarial software vendors and legal and accounting practitioners to name but a few that would be impacted by this reform in the corporate code. They have been identified and specific and relevant communications and updates in preparation for implementation will be targeted by the CRO to each of these groups. In particular, the CRO is working with representative bodies for major stakeholders, such as the accounting and auditing professional bodies, to ensure that clear and early information on this new code is available.</p>, <p eid="para_642"> Senator White also referred to receivership and examinership. The Government is supportive of the examinership process and brought forward legislation last year to give more small companies access to it and try to save as many jobs as possible.</p>, <p eid="para_643"> Senator Quinn raised concerns about the regulation of the title "accountant". In 2007 the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, recommended the regulation of this title in the interests of consumer protection. On foot of this the Department considered the matter and noted the views of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition Authority. The Competition Authority took the strong view that there was no clear public interest case that would warrant the legal protection of the term "accountant". The authority noted the statutory regulation of a title automatically creates barriers to entry and market rigidity that can have negative impacts for service users. Based on this consideration, the fact the title is not protected in the UK, with which we are closely associated in all matters relating to accounting, the lack of data quantifying the detriment to the consumer and the ongoing discussions of the EU professional qualifications directive, it was considered that the evidence does not support the regulation of the term "accountant". While it is clear that there is a benefit to consumers in knowing that professionals are fully qualified and hold appropriate levels of indemnity insurance, consideration must also be given to the potential for adverse consequences such as added cost to business, increased cost of regulation and compliance, barriers to entry and to competitiveness, inhibition of the market and a threat to the continuing existence of good practitioners that do not meet the new requirements.</p>, <p eid="para_644"> The Government is also obliged to consider the principles of better regulation and the Competition Authority considered the issue specifically in light of the principles of necessity, proportionality and effectiveness. Under each of these headings the authority found that the proposal did not meet the requirements of better regulation. However, in light of the concerns expressed by the accounting bodies the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has asked officials in our Department to undertake an assessment of the issues by consulting with key stakeholders such as professional bodies, consumer representatives, small business representatives, regulators, the Revenue Commissioners, the Companies Registration Office and other official bodies with an interest in this matter. Members of the Oireachtas have also met the Minister to discuss this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_645"> Senators Quinn and Michael D'Arcy spoke of making life easier for small businesses. We all wholeheartedly support this and the Bill is intended to do exactly that. In terms of reducing administrative burdens the Bill will implement a number of reforms on red tape that will make it easier and cheaper to run a company in Ireland and this will make a real difference to our international competitiveness. The Bill will make company law more accessible for the end user and reduce the complexity of doing business with companies. The main savings will come from the ease of setting up a company, the written AGM, the streamlining of corporate governance procedures and reduced professional fees. For example, the provisions relating to examinership allow small private companies apply directly to the local Circuit Court, rather than the High Court. </p>, <p eid="para_646"> Senator Bacik spoke of redundancy payments and they are now managed by the Department of Social Protection under the insolvency scheme. However, officials from my Department are working with that Department to find a solution in cases where employees are abandoned by a company that does not formally wind up. This work is ongoing and we all share the concerns raised here relating to the Paris Bakery, though this issue goes beyond that business and applies on a wider scale.</p>, <p eid="para_647"> Senator Bacik also raised the matter of the deeming provisions and it is correct that a private limited company will be a DAC during the transition period. It is also correct that such a company will be able to benefit from the new limited structure, even if it does not actively change to allow itself to be deemed at the end of the transition period. I hope that answers the question.</p>, <p eid="para_648"> Senator Barrett expressed concern about companies not having a physical AGM. It is worth noting that a company can, of course, hold an AGM and there is no barrier to doing this. It is up to the company whether the AGM is in writing or in person and it is a private matter for the members of a private company.</p>, <p eid="para_649"> Senator Cullinane referred to the financial crisis, as have other Senators, and asked what actions have been taken to deal with its effects. The drafting of the Companies Bill began before the financial crisis but it has not been a static process. The CLRG has produced 15 reports since 2000 and its recommendations are generally reflected in this Bill. Most recently action was immediately taken on foot of a recommendation that small companies be permitted to initiate examinership proceedings in the Circuit Court as a less costly way to facilitate small companies in difficulties. The Bill also incorporates the 2009 Act, which increased and clarified the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and increased the disclosure requirements relating to loans made by companies to directors. These are just a few examples of how the Bill has been adapted to take account of current economic circumstances. I want it to be on the record of this House that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, was included in the deliberations of the CLRG. If a document is to be quoted verbatim on the record of this House I would like to know what it is. Perhaps it could be circulated to all of us.</p>]
[<p eid="para_651">Senator Cullinane is concerned that the full rights, powers and privileges of a company under section 38 of the Bill will confer human rights on companies to the detriment of workers. That is wonderfully rhetorical, if I may be so bold as to say so. The full and unlimited capacity referred to in section 38 has been included because under existing law a company has no capacity to carry on business except in so far as its constitution allows. This rule has resulted in enormous objects clauses that named every activity conceivable to its drafters. It has proved ineffective in protecting the rights of creditors and members. As a result it has been abandoned in other common law jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom.</p>, <p eid="para_652"> Under the Bill, although directors can still be made liable for participation in certain activities by the Constitution, section 38 means that all contracts properly made on behalf of the company will be binding. It does not give a company human rights such as the unlimited capacity to enter into civil partnerships, adopt children, to be elected to public office nor even become the sole director of another company. All of these things are reserved to human persons. In terms of rights, it is well established jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights that human rights may be engaged with regard to the activities of companies. For example, it has held that the right to free speech under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects advertising, including advertising by companies. Rights to privacy, property and fair trial have also been successfully argued for companies at the European Court of Human Rights. These rights are now well established and are unrelated to changes in this Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_653"> Senator Mooney asked which companies were the non-PLCs. They are mostly small private companies limited by shares and a smaller portion are companies limited by guarantee, CLGs, which are mainly sporting clubs and charities. Regarding getting rid of the "place of business", it is intended that this provision will tighten up matters as companies will not be allowed operate without making appropriate annual returns - they will be required to do so.</p>, <p eid="para_654"> The issue of multinationals and tax minimisation schemes has been raised today.</p>, <p eid="para_655">While I understand the genuinely held concerns of the Senators, this is a matter that is best addressed within tax law. </p>, <p eid="para_656"> My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is very clear on his objective of making Ireland part of the solution to global tax challenges, and not part of the problem. International companies are in a position to avail of the differences in tax law between jurisdictions in order to minimise their taxes to the greatest extent possible. Therefore, the most effective way to address this international issue is for countries to work together. Ireland is playing an active role in the OECD base erosion and profit shifting process, BEPS, and is fully supportive of international efforts in this regard. </p>, <p eid="para_657"> I am aware that the drafting of this Bill has involved a hugely collaborative effort to date and I know that we can maintain that approach as it moves through the House. To return to Senator White's point, the legislation has transcended many mandates, political parties and stakeholders. I am not saying that it is apolitical but there has been a degree of collegiality about the approach. I look forward to that further collegiality in terms of listening to the Senators' amendments when they bring them forward. </p>, <p eid="para_658"> I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate. I look forward to engaging again with them on Committee and Report Stages.</p>]
[<p eid="para_666">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>, <p eid="para_667"> When a relevant offence is detected, the registered owner of the vehicle involved receives a fixed charge notice. I know that is stating the obvious but I wish to set out the process. The address to which the fixed charge notice is posted is either the one supplied by the driver, when intercepted by An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, or the address listed on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's national vehicle and driver file or, NVDF.</p>, <p eid="para_668"> The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for enforcement of the legislation, that ordinary post is utilised to serve fixed charge notices, in accordance with section 25 of the Interpretation Act 2005. This provides that service of a document may be effected by post and that such service is deemed to have been effected at the time at which a letter would ordinarily have been delivered, unless the contrary is proved. The Minister is also advised that road traffic legislation provides that, in a prosecution relating to an unpaid fixed charge notice, it shall be presumed that the relevant fixed charge notice has been served, or caused to be served, and that a payment pursuant to the relevant notice has not been made, unless the contrary is shown.</p>, <p eid="para_669"> In so far as the use of registered post is concerned, the Minister will convey the Senator's views on this matter to the Garda authorities and to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. However, the Minister for Justice and Equality would note that use of registered post would not overcome objections that notices were received by persons other than those for whom they were intended, or that persons would seek to avoid service by declining to accept such registered notices. There would also be logistical and cost implications associated with issuing what could be more than 400,000 registered letters annually, in circumstances where a majority of persons receive and pay the fixed charge notices under current arrangements with no difficulties.</p>, <p eid="para_670"> The Senator will also be aware that section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 will introduce what is commonly referred to as a "third payment option" into the fixed charge system. Under this mechanism a person, who is summonsed to court for a fixed charge offence, will have a final option to pay a fixed charge not later than seven days before the court date on which the charge is to be heard. Without reading the rest of the statement, the central point has been made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_677">I thank the Senator for raising the issue. Again, I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>, <p eid="para_678"> In terms of the current recruitment competition, any member of the Garda Reserve was entitled to apply for a position for the full-time service, provided they met the statutory requirements. I can advise Senators that, furthermore, the admission and appointment regulations provide that, as part of the competitive selection process organised by the Public Appointments Service for full-time membership of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, "due recognition to any satisfactory service by the person as a reserve member" shall be given to such candidates, This provision was introduced in order to acknowledge the beneficial experience and skills gained by a reserve member and to allow them, at assessments and at interview, the opportunity to highlight that experience and skill.</p>, <p eid="para_679"> In February 2008 the Garda Commissioner established a group to review training and development for Garda and civilian staff in the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na. The report of the review group was published in May 2009 and the contents were noted by the then Government. The objective of the review group was to make recommendations to improve and reinvigorate Garda training in line with best practice in order to meet the new challenges of a changing society. One of the key recommendations identified by the group was that the student-probationer training programme should be radically restructured. The course for Garda trainees is a high level BA course, which necessitates a certain academic capability. The revised training programme stemming from the recommendations of the review group was devised in order to better prepare recruits for the modern policing environment. The main differences between the new and the previous programme is that the new programme carries a greater emphasis on operational policing and focuses on real life scenarios which in turn prepare students for the policing challenges they will face. The new programme will also instil a lifelong learning philosophy for members of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, with a suite of mandatory and elective courses made available.</p>, <p eid="para_680"> I will now outline the stages of the process. The interview stage allows reserve candidates to demonstrate their experience, having a deeper understanding of the work involved as a fully-fledged member. By virtue of their exposure to work in the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, they are in a position to perform well at the structured competency based interview and offer highly relevant examples of how they demonstrated the key competencies required. Interview boards have been briefed in the work of the reserve and their experience in this context.</p>, <p eid="para_681"> It is important that all persons wishing to join the full-time force undergo the same competitive selection and recruitment process. In doing so the integrity of the process is maintained. However, the mechanisms mentioned give the reserve members the opportunity to demonstrate their on-the-job learning acquired as members of the reserve. This allows them some advantage in the recruitment process.</p>, <p eid="para_682"> I can advise Senators that there are currently 1,192 attested reserve gardaÃ­ with a further 89 at various stages of training. To date, 40 reserve members have become full Garda members, and we will, no doubt, see more joining the ranks from this recruitment competition. Garda reserve members make a real and tangible contribution to policing right across the country and we are all fully supportive of its continued development. In this regard, recruitment to the reserve and training of new reserve members is ongoing.</p>, <p eid="para_683"> The Minister would like to assure the Senator that the Government is and will continue to be, fully committed to the Garda Reserve. The Minister would also encourage reserve members to apply for the full-time force if they are interested in and committed to being a full-time member. The assessment process will ensure that those who are successful have the capability both to pass the BA course in Applied Policing, as well as the ability to carry out the important functions of a full-time member.</p>]
[<p eid="para_690">I thank the Senator for his good wishes and extend my own good wishes to him and his betrothed on their impending nuptials and wish them the best of luck in their future.</p>, <p eid="para_691"> I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe Costello. I thank the Senator for raising the issue. We must acknowledge the work and support of the all-party Oireachtas group on sexual and reproductive health and development in supporting the aid programme in difficult financial circumstances domestically and particularly for its work in raising the profile of the issues around gender equality and sexual and reproductive health rights. Population planning remains a priority for Ireland. This is reflected in the funding allocated to population assistance. According to the UNFPA's latest report on tracking the financial resource targets agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development, ICPD, Ireland ranked fourth in terms of the percentage of our official development assistance allocated to the specified population assistance activities. This funding is vitally important to ensure that our partners, such as UNFPA, various NGOs and other partners can deliver programmes which empower women and provide access to sexual and reproductive health rights not only in key partner countries but in more complex settings, such as those referenced by the Senator, affected by natural disaster or conflict and where continued access to reproductive health is particularly critical for women and girls.</p>, <p eid="para_692">We have strongly supported the ICPD global review process which provides the continued evidence to incorporate broader population planning issues into the new sustainable and universal post-2015 development framework. The review report confirms the importance of the linkages between human rights, non-discrimination, equality, sexual and reproductive health and population dynamics for sustainable development.</p>, <p eid="para_693"> Under the General Assembly the UN will convene a special session on 22 September to follow up on the programme of action from the ICPD. Ireland will use this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the full implementation of the programme of action and we will work closely with the EU and UN to ensure its recommendations are fully reflected in the post-2015 development framework which must ensure no one is left behind. This means addressing the fragmented implementation of the programme of action. It also means being unafraid to address all elements of the ICPD vision, including sexual and reproductive health, and in doing so that we reach the most marginalised. It is only through this approach that we can address the reason we are all here and truly achieve gender equality and sustainable and inclusive development.</p>]
[<p eid="para_695">I thank the Senator for raising the issue. We use many acronyms in this business, and I should state the ICPD is the International Conference on Population and Development. I acknowledge this year is the 20th anniversary of the ICPD, which itself marked an important new consensus recognising that increasing social, economic and political equality, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, should be the basis for individual well-being, lower population growth and sustainable development.</p>]
