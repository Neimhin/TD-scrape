SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am delighted the witnesses are here today because this represents a golden opportunity for the committee to have some degree of analysis on what has been going on within the retail food sector in recent months in particular.  When I think of what happened at the time of the May bank holiday weekend with regard to Tesco my strong feeling is that it pulled off the greatest stroke that was ever pulled off in the retail food sector.  It dressed up a designed plan to extract as many Irish products and goods from the planograms in their stores as a mechanism to reduce prices to the consumer.  If one listened to the testimonials of shoppers coming from the stores after that weekend it was branded as a triumph for the consumer in reduced prices and that the consumer was winning as a result.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In a very small area.However, when one digs a little deeper one realises that Irish household name brands and products were extracted from the shelves.  These include Batchelors, Lyons Tea, Barry's Tea, Dubliner cheese and Tayto, which were squeezed out of the space they had held heretofore.  I fear that Tesco aims at the creation of what I can only describe as a "tescopoly".  It now has 26% of the market and is reaching for more.  Rather than carrying more Irish products, its stores will sell a wider array of own brand, imported and arguably inferior goods.  This insidious practice needs to be stopped.  I am glad the witnesses have come up with a concrete set of proposals.  Rational debate is required on food margins because since the introduction of the euro, Irish consumers can easily compare the price of a basket of goods in Spain, for example, with similar products in Ireland.  It was easy to argue that Irish producers were adding the margins that created significant price difference, whereas they were determined by the larger multiples which have such control of the market that they are stealthily squeezing out Irish producers.  It is a dangerous strategy with serious implications for job creation in the future.A document launched yesterday by IBEC and the Food and Drink Industry of Ireland notes that the cost inputs of food production in Ireland are significantly higher than in other European countries.  Mr. Power made a similar point in his contribution.  How do we address the issues of margins?  How can we put in place a legislative framework that allows the primary producers and retailers to take their cuts while allowing the consumer to pay a price which is similar to elsewhere in Europe?  Reinstating the groceries order or reviewing the role of the Competition Authority may offer ways of achieving that goal.  Fair trade legislation is also an option.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on how such legislation could be implemented to ensure a level playing field for retailers, consumers and primary producers.Regarding Tesco's sourcing of foodstuffs from abroad, and the UK in particular, what would happen if the other multiples followed suit?  Ms Campbell referred to Aldi's apparently healthy relationship with Irish producers.  Is it possible to estimate the number of potential job losses and what would be the outcome of a supermarket price war on the Irish market?The grocery sector has been extremely exposed to currency fluctuations between the euro and sterling.  I am trying to assess the impact on Tesco's prices if sterling appreciates.  In regard to the announcement over the bank holiday weekend on dramatically reduced prices for the UK basket of goods, I believe these prices will increase over the long term and Irish consumers will end up paying more than they have heretofore.What are the witnesses' views on the relationship between the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  The former Department's announcement of €641 million for agri-food research programmes seems disconnected from the latter's policies for job creation in the sector.  My impression is that a cross-departmental approach is not being taken.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food deals with farmers, the co-operative movement and the European Union but it does not appear to have an input into the role of the retail sector in agricultural policy.My awareness of the potential for growth in the food industry was enhanced by the document Mr. Powers produced for Agri-Aware.  If this committee is to influence the retail sector, it will have to develop a concrete set of proposals that can be presented to the Government.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Starting with Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I do not believe it is necessarily a case of getting rid of the multiples rather one of levelling the playing pitch concerning the margins ascertained between the producer and the retailer.  That must be borne in mind.  I do not advocate the abolition of the multiples.  They are necessary and have a place within the market.  I refer to a point raised by Ms Campbell on the effects on small towns and the increasing consolidation of the retail sector.  She referred to the High Court decision on the Kerry Group's acquisition vis-à-vis Dairygold.  There seems to be a contradiction between the consolidation of the co-operative or dairy sector and the need for local food markets.  We are told the abolition of milk quotas will take place in 2015 and producers will then be part of a global, competitive market because many of the price supports will no longer remain in the dairy industry.  The net consequence will be an increase and even further consolidation of the co-operative movement and processing.  Therefore, the brands we all know and love will probably be owned by one or two players in the market.  That model compares with the situation in north Cork, for example, in which the new market co-operative movement has begun.  It is a small niche model with high end products that compete quite well.  At question is how to marry the two models and strike a balance between the local needs and the ability of Ireland incorporated to compete in a global market post 2015.  Politically, the subsidisation of agriculture by the European Union will diminish in the next 20 years or so, because the WTO will probably influence outcomes in that regard.What is the perfect model, if there is such a thing, in terms of how to increase exports and at the same time marry that goal to the needs of developing retail within the high streets?  Currently, property rights are so entrenched in the county that if a local authority sought to tackle dereliction or a boarded up shop in a town centre, it could not do so because it would be dragged through the courts.  The rights of the property owner outweighs that of the common good in terms of a main street property and they supersede the right of the town in terms of its enhancement of the town centre.  I trust the delegation understands the point I am trying to make.  There must be a fundamental re-shaping of this position.  I have been a member of a local authority and I have witnessed what happens to lands adjoining a town centre in which the so-called "donut effect" is created.  It is a consequence of the need to attract the bigger retailers to get increased footfall in a given town.  Unless a local authority can provide parking, change the fundamental property rights of people within town centres or it has the ability to impose a CPO, compulsory purchase order, on derelict land then that policy will never change.  What is the view of the delegation?
