[<p eid="para_126">I join in welcoming all the contributors.  Mr. Cotter said 8% of world production is traded so that supply and demand swings can have big effects on the market.  To what extent, post 2015, will the commodities market affect the Irish dairy sector?  If we are currently trading at €2.2 billion, does Mr. Cotter see a significant variation in that figure after 2015 or is there, necessarily, a correlation between the two?</p>, <p eid="para_127">How much of the €2.2 billion, which is the dairy sector's contribution to food exports, filters down to the primary producer?  If one compares prices in 1979 with current prices and considers the present system of regulation, one must accept that the primary producer is a net loser.  How do we develop a model of agriculture which will deal with the potential abyss of 2015?  What structures can we put in place to ensure that the family farm can continue?  I would like to hear the views of the farming organisations on this question.</p>, <p eid="para_128">If there is to be greater consolidation of the dairying sector in 2015, it follows that there must be consolidation of farm holdings.  Hundreds of farms will cease to exist and will be consolidated into a new structure with a small number of large producers.  If there is another possibility I would like to hear it, but that is how I see things developing if we are to compete with countries like New Zealand in the global market.</p>, <p eid="para_129">The New Zealand model is not based on the family farm.  The product is sold into a single milk market.  Is that the system we want to see in Ireland and is that where we are going?  Is there a disjoint between what the co-operatives, or plcs, are saying and what the primary producers are thinking?  If the farmer is the price taker from the co-operative, which he owns and in which he has an active stake, does the farmer not control the price?  That thought has occurred to me in the recent past.</p>, <p eid="para_130">There has been much talk of volatility.  How do we guard against it in the abyss of 2015?  What mechanisms can be used to ensure the incomes of family farms as pledged in the Treaty of Rome?  Farming organisations say the future is not bright.  How can politicians ensure that a long term view of the future of agriculture is taken?  I am speaking of a 20 year and not a two or three year view.  I see the point Mr. Cahill is making about reducing quota in terms of guaranteeing a price for the present, but is that sustainable in the long term?  A farmer might derive an increase in price per litre now if there is a reduction in quota, but what is the scenario for the same farmer in 2015?  That is the question I am trying to grapple with in terms of how we take political responsibility for what needs to happen in agriculture in the future and how we can maintain the comparative advantage in terms of production.  I could go on but I do not want to hog the meeting.</p>]
