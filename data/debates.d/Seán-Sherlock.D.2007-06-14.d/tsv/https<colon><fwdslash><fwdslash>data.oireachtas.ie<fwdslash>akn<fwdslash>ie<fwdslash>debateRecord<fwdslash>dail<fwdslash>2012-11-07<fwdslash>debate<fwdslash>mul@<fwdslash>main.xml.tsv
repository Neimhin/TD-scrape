[<p eid="para_988">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who is travelling on Government business.</p>, <p eid="para_989"> A number of developments will impact on teachers in VEC schools during the coming school year. First, the commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 will prohibit the payment of people employed as teachers in recognised schools unless they are registered with the Teaching Council. I take the Deputy's point in this regard. The second major development will be enhanced requirements from April 2013 for registration with the Teaching Council as a further education teacher. The requirement for registration will be increased from a degree-level qualification to a requirement to hold a teacher training qualification in addition to an undergraduate level award.</p>, <p eid="para_990"> Individuals without recognised qualifications who were employed in a teaching position or eligible to be employed in a teaching position in a recognised school at the time of the establishment of the Teaching Council in 2006 were deemed registered with the Teaching Council in its first year. Teachers were advised at the time to seek registration with the council and to ensure that their registrations were maintained. If such people availed of this entitlement at the time and subsequently maintained their registrations, there is no change to their position. A dispensation was given at the time and there is no basis for it to be given again.</p>, <p eid="para_991"> It has been the policy of the Department of Education and Skills for some time that only qualified and registered teachers should be employed by schools. Current recruitment procedures direct schools to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid posts must be registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the posts for which they are proposed.</p>, <p eid="para_992"> Since 2006, any unregistered person employed by a VEC in a teaching post has been on notice that, once section 30 became law, there would be no basis to continue paying him or her. Therefore, such persons can have no reasonable expectation of continued employment beyond the period of time that it takes the school to source a registered teacher. It is expected that section 30 will be commenced later in the school year. This will ensure that only registered teachers are employed in teaching positions in our schools. Separate provision will be made for urgent situations where no registered teacher is available.</p>, <p eid="para_993"> Notice of the imminent commencement of section 30 and the Teaching Council's registration requirements has been in the public domain for some time. Sufficient time has been available for individuals to engage with the Teaching Council to gain registration. It is the Government's view that all teachers should be appropriately qualified. This is surely the minimum that our children deserve. The commencement of section 30 is intended to buttress that policy and will be to the advantage of ensuring a quality education for all.</p>]
[<p eid="para_998">I respectfully assure the Deputy that I am working from a prepared script because I want to allow him the time-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1000">I know, but I want to internalise what we are saying. Given that this is a technical issue, it is important that my reply be carefully scripted.</p>, <p eid="para_1001"> The position is clear. We understand that some people in the mainstream primary, post-primary and post-leaving certificate, PLC, space, such as the gentleman to whom the Deputy referred, have contracts of indefinite duration and are employed in place of teachers. Where such an individual has been employed in an unqualified capacity since 2006, has allowed his or her registration to lapse and has taken no steps to become qualified in the intervening years, it will be a matter for that person to decide whether to take an approved, unpaid leave of absence to gain the necessary qualifications for registration.</p>, <p eid="para_1002">As long as he or she remains unregistered, his or her capacity to be paid as a teacher in the public sector will be limited to the kind of short-term unforeseen employment which will be permissible under the ministerial regulations. From 1 April 2013, under the Teaching Council registration regulations 2009, the threshold for entry on the registry will increase in all categories of registration. Since the Department has already set registration as a requirement for employment in the above circulars, this higher threshold applies automatically in terms of employment from 1 April next independently of the section 30 requirements. The commencement of section 30 will reinforce the Department's longstanding position that education in recognised schools funded by the State must be delivered by appropriately regulated professionals. I do not think anybody would argue against that. This position must be maintained in the interests of providing the best possible education for the very students about whom we are talking.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1011">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn. The fact the Deputy raised it gives us an opportunity to clarify the current position in regard to the application for additional accommodation at Lanesboro community college, Lanesboro, County Longford.</p>, <p eid="para_1012"> I am aware that enrolment at the school on 30 September 2012 was 176 mainstream students and 25 post-leaving certificate students. Enrolment at September 2011 consisted of 167 mainstream students and 65 post-leaving certificate students. This reveals a slight increase of nine mainstream students but a reduction of 40 post-leaving certificate students for the 2012-13 school year.</p>, <p eid="para_1013"> In November 2011, the VEC submitted an application for capital funding to the Department for a major extension at Lanesboro community college. However, the Deputy will be aware that in view of the very real need to ensure that a child has access to a school place, the delivery of essential mainstream classroom accommodation will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.</p>, <p eid="para_1014"> The VEC subsequently submitted a revised application that focused on the need for classroom accommodation along the lines of the case outlined by the Deputy. To assist with the assessment of the school's further application, an inspector visited Lanesboro community college in September. On the basis of the inspector's visit, the Department approved funding to construct two permanent classrooms at the school. This decision was conveyed to County Longford VEC on 17 October 2012 and a formal letter setting out the level of grant and the conditions associated with the grant aid was furnished to the VEC today, so the Deputy's timing is impeccable.</p>, <p eid="para_1015"> County Longford VEC has expressed satisfaction with the grant approved. The responsibility for delivering the project has been devolved to the VEC and it will now be a matter for it to progress the project through the various stages from architectural planning to construction. The Department's letter of approval contains guidance that will assist the VEC in this regard. I thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the application for capital funding for Lanesboro community college.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1021">The Deputy should have regard to other people.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1023">With all due respect, the Deputy raised an issue and I replied to it. We should stick to our guns on this matter. The issue has been expedited satisfactorily and I know the Deputy will speak highly of the collegiality of his partners in Government when he relates this to the people on the streets of Longford. I sincerely thank him for raising this matter.</p>]
