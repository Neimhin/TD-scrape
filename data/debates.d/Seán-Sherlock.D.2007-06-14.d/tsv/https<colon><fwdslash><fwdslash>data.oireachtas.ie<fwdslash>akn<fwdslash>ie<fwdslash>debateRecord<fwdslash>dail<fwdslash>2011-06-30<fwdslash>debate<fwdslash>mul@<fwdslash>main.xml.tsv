SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The drive to encourage Irish companies to use science, technology and innovation to increase competitiveness and value added is a significant pillar of government policy. As the government agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, Enterprise Ireland provides support to maximise the R&D and innovative potential of Irish firms in order to increase their capability to create new products, services and exports, which result in additional employment opportunities within these firms and in the wider community with which they interact.Cognisant of the difficulties and the investment requirements in starting an R&D activity for the first time, the programme of company R&D supports are designed to provide support for research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development and supports companies in their progress from an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&D activities.The Innovation Voucher initiative in particular is playing an important role in opening up access for small companies to a wide source of innovative acumen available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. The Initiative aims to drive an innovation cultural shift within small enterprise by promoting and encouraging a transfer of knowledge between Ireland's public knowledge providers and the small business community and in the process creating on-going and lasting synergies between the two.  The programme provides vouchers worth €5,000 that can be used by the average small Irish company to bring in knowledge that is new to the company. Since 2008, €380,000 worth of Innovation Vouchers has been awarded to companies in Westmeath and €30,000 worth of Vouchers has been awarded to Longford based companies. These Vouchers have been strongly promoted and feedback from companies has been positive, confirming that the application procedures, level of funding, the low level of bureaucracy and the frequency of calls are welcome features of this initiative.Direct R&D funding for larger projects is also available under the R&D Fund, which will enable companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&D activities. Since 2008 €567,000 worth of funding has been awarded to Longford based companies and €1.4m awarded to Westmeath companies.Increased innovation and start-ups particularly in the high technology sectors are vital to the future growth of the Midlands.  In this context, a grant of €2.54m was approved in order to establish the Midlands Innovation & Research Centre (MIRC), which offers a range of supports to entrepreneurs who wish to start a new, export focused, technology based business. The 800m2  facility at Athlone Institute of Technology has, as of December 2010, seven companies occupying units, employing 24 people, as well as 13 emerging entrepreneurs making use of the hot-desk facilities at the centre.Enterprise Ireland also funds applied research and supports the industry engagement capabilities of Universities and Institutes of Technology.  Since 2009,  Athlone Institute of Technology has been awarded over €4.6m in order to bolster their industry relevant research capabilities. This includes ongoing support for the Applied Research Enhancement Centre — SUNAT (Seamless Use through Network Abstraction Technologies), which is a translational research centre in the area of seamless communications and specialises in adaptive networking technologies.Through the vote of my Department, funds will continue to be provided to support and encourage enterprises, in particular small enterprises, to engage in R & D through a mix of funding, advice and expertise in order to help businesses transform in terms of improved productivity, greater efficiencies and achieving necessary product and service innovation to support growth and jobs.

Funding of research proposals is dependent on the availability of funding at any given time and notifications of funding calls including eligibility criteria are publicised on the Foundation's website from time to time.
