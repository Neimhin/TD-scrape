Examples of these groups are:MACSI — the Mathematical Applications Consortium for Science and Industry at the University of Limerick,ICHEC — Irish Centre for High-End Computing at NUI Galway and Trinity College Dublin;The 4C group (the Cork Constraint Computation Centre) at UCC; andThe Hamilton Institute at NUI Maynooth.Each of these groups has already an excellent track record of success in working with multiple industry partners. Now as part of the evolution of our national research effort and for further enterprise development needs SFI are looking at ways to consolidate our own mathematics groups in this area to fully realise the potential for Irish industry and beyond.Ireland must, if we are to reach our full potential and compete on a global stage, ensure that we foster the development of mathematicians and bring them together with industry to generate progress and innovation. Working in conjunction with a European Institute of Mathematics and Innovation is very much aligned with our policy thinking.Ensuring enhanced mathematical capacity at national level is also underpinned by policy initiatives being delivered through the Department of Education and Skills such as the establishment of the National Centre of Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching and Learning, based in the University of Limerick; the introduction of curricula changes such as Project Maths; and the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020, "Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life".

This judgment also stated that Ireland was not in compliance with its obligations under EU law.Several concerns were expressed after the judgment by interested parties.  Accordingly a public consultation was held on the wording of the proposed Statutory Instrument.  This consultation was widely publicised at the time and more than 50 submissions were received.  I am extremely grateful to those interested parties, groups and individuals who responded.  Their submissions have proved very valuable in providing a comprehensive understanding of the differing views on the many issues involved.  There was also liaison with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.The submissions were carefully considered and legal opinion contained therein was referred to the Office of the Attorney General.  I also met with several organisations with specific interests. The matter was debated in the Dáil on 31st   January 2012. I made it clear then that any injunction under the proposed amendment of the Copyright Act 2000 would have to be considered in the context of the pronouncements of the Court of Justice of the European Union in judgments connected with this area.These judgments (particularly Sabam v Scarlet and Sabam v Netlog)  held that the protection of the fundamental right to intellectual property must be balanced against the protection of the fundamental rights of others who would be affected by the granting of an injunction.  These rights include the right to conduct a business, to privacy, to freedom to receive and impart information.  In addition, any measures proposed should not be unnecessarily complicated or costly.Since the Lisbon Treaty, any legislation upholding EU law is bound by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.As the nature of injunctions which may be sought is infinitely varied, I consider that the best protection for balancing all the rights involved will be obtained by a careful scrutiny on a case-by-case basis of the competing interests by means of judicial process.
