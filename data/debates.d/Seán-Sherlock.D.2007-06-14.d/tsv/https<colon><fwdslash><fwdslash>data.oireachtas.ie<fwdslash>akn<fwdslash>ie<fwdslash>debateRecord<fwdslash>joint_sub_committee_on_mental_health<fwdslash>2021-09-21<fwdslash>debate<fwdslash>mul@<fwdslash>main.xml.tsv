SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:20:00+01:00	I thank Senator Hoey for allowing me to deputise on her behalf at this meeting. How many beds are situated in the Owenacurra centre?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:20:00+01:00	How many beds are registered for respite?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:20:00+01:00	Would the families of residents who stayed at the centre for short periods have classed that stay as respite or inpatient? I suggest to the witnesses that we have to be very careful about language here because there is an expectation within the community that there is a respite provision. We can use all of the euphemistic language that we like. The HSE's understanding may be that they are technically not respite beds, but they are known and understood within the community to be respite beds. Notwithstanding that those beds may not have been occupied over the period of the pandemic, I suggest to the HSE that in closing this centre it is removing a massive respite service and that is going to have a knock-on effect for the people of Midleton, Youghal, Cobh and further afield. What consideration is the HSE giving to St. Stephen's Hospital as an alternative setting for some of the residents of the Owenacurra centre?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:20:00+01:00	I beg the Chair's protection. I do not wish to sound rude, but allow me to rephrase the question. Is the HSE, "Yes" or "No" considering St. Stephen's Hospital as an alternative accommodation for current residents of the Owenacurra centre?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:25:00+01:00	Can I take it that the HSE is considering St. Stephen's Hospital and, possibly, St. Catherine's centre as well? If it is the case that the HSE is considering all of the needs of all of the patients, I put it to the HSE and to the clinical director that taking people out of the Owenacurra single room setting on the basis that room sizes are too small, as identified in the Mental Health Commission report, and putting them into a ward setting is a Dickensian and backward step and is not in the interests of the residents. I hope the HSE is not considering that as an option. I am no therapist or clinician, but I know from talking to the families that from a therapeutic point of view, that would be a very poor step. I ask Mr. Fitzgerald to respond. If he can tell me that the HSE is not considering St. Stephen's Hospital as an option, a lot of people will be very relieved.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:25:00+01:00	Is the Mental Health Commission currently doing a review of St. Stephen's Hospital?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2021-09-21T13:25:00+01:00	Has the Mental Health Commission been in touch with the HSE in respect of St. Stephen's Hospital? Is Mr. Fitzgerald aware of whether the Mental Health Commission has visited St. Stephen's Hospital? In terms of where I am coming from on this, Cois Alla in Kanturk covers a geographical area, Solas Nua covers Mallow, the Carrigabrick service covers Fermoy and the Carrigmore service covers Cork. What the HSE is doing in closing Owenacurra centre is to de facto take out a massive geographical area in terms of residential capability, including respite and short-term capability. That is the message that is being sent to the families. As a committee, we have to speak for the families. The witnesses may argue that we are being rhetorical in doing so, but we empathise and sympathise with the families on the basis that we share their concerns and fears that this process, which started in June and is to be a four-month process, is too short. Not enough time or consideration has been given to all of the factors involved such that every person can be happy that whatever transition he or she makes will be safe for him or her, but that if there are any question marks over the process, a break will be put on it.  The Minister should intervene directly on this issue. At this stage, we have all been in contact with him about this. There needs to be pause for thought and reflection about whether we are sending residents who have made huge progress from a therapeutic point of view backwards instead of forwards into life. We should not be providing services in a setting that is further away from where they live and where their families are. Do the witnesses understand those fears? They are legitimate fears on the part of people and we are trying to reflect them to the witnesses. I refer again to the services in Kanturk, Mallow, Fermoy and Carrigmore. They are set within the towns and they are fit for purpose, although I accept there are issues with them from time to time in terms of meeting the full panoply of regulations. I am not convinced.We have heard here from every single member across the political divide that there needs to be some pause for reflection on this. Quite frankly, the witnesses have not fully articulated the issue of the cost of replacement. They state that they have produced an internal report. However, it is unconscionable that the HSE should come to this committee without anticipating a question from one or all members as to how much would it cost to do the repairs and refurbishment, as well as on the cost of a replacement building on that site. The HSE has significant capital resources to do that. We do not want a situation following this decision whereby people in the east Cork region who need access to mental health services will be left bereft. I ask that the HSE pauses and reflects on this decision. They have given four months' notice. If you are kicking a dog out of the kennel, you would give him more notice than you have given some of these people to be out of their home. I am sorry if I sound exercised about this issue but I feel strongly about it. A pause needs to be put on this in the public interest and in order that we as public representatives have more time to interrogate line by line everything that you are doing here. Then we can fully and with good conscience represent constituents for whom we are deeply concerned on this matter. I apologise that I have used up most of my time, Chair. They have 30 seconds to reply.
