SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T13:30:00+01:00	Apologies have been received from Deputy Martin Heydon. The usual rules apply on mobile phones. I will follow my own direction on that and put my phone on airplane mode. I propose that we now go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:30:00+01:00	The next item on the agenda is to record the decisions of the committee. The first petition for consideration is No. P000007/17, from Mrs. Alexandra Koster, relating to the eradication of homework for children in primary school. We have agreed to forward a copy of the petitioner's response to the Minister for Education and Skills to establish whether there is any intention to review the type of homework distributed to children in primary schools and also to seek clarification as to how the Department monitors the engagement by schools with parents and students in establishing a homework policy. We would also request that the petitioner substantiate her suggestion of the following: that there is firm evidence based on extensive research which suggests that homework for young people is of little or no educational benefit and can often be the cause of stress and anxiety from a young age; and the teaching of young children should be play and activity based with lots of outdoor time and opportunities to move around physically. We recommend that we keep the petition open and ask the petitioner to advance further some of the assertions she has made. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next petition for consideration is No. P000012/17 to devolve full legal responsibility and decision-making for archaeology and heritage to the Heritage Council. The suggestion is that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Heritage Council of Ireland to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	It is recorded that the committee will close the petition. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000019/17, from Mr. Johnny Anderson, that the Lough Foyle ferry service should be maintained by the British and Irish Governments. It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from Donegal County Council and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. The committee will also outline that, due to the uncertainty of the effects of Brexit, the committee recommends the Department assist Donegal County Council in seeking funding for ferry services which have the potential to increase tourism in coastal areas; request that the Minister report any progress on funding back to the committee; correspond with the Northern Ireland Assembly on the funding of this route; correspond with Donegal County Council; and outline that the committee will correspond with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as with the Northern Ireland Assembly, on funding for ferry services which have the potential to increase tourism in coastal areas. We will forward a copy of the responses received to the petitioner and, due to the uncertainty of Brexit and its impact on the areas mentioned, the petition will remain open. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	Does the Deputy agree with the committee’s proposals?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000024/17, from Mr. Christian Fuglsang, on regulatory action on insurance claims and premiums. Given the work of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and the working group on insurance, it is recommended that copies of the report of the working group and the first quarterly progress report are forwarded to the petitioner. It has been agreed, however, in private session to keep the petition open. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	That is agreed then. The next petition for consideration is petition No. P000030/17, from Ms. Arjita Chawla, a request for amending legislation relating to dog control. It is proposed the committee corresponds with the Department responsible and requests that clearer communication on this matter be available in each city council and local authority public office. The committee will also seek clarification of the enforcement powers relating to a court decision under current legislation; correspond with the County and City Management Association and request that it also contact all its members and suggest that clearer communication on this matter be available in each city council and local authority public office; and forward a copy of the response from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to the petitioner, informing her of the decision of the committee on the petition. It is also proposed that the committee requests that she provides proof of a decision of the court not being executed. Are the recommendations agreed? Agreed. The last petition for consideration is petition No. P000032/17, from Mr. Frederic Vidal, entitled Catalan Civil Rights Compromised. The petitioner wishes to invite representatives from the Houses of the Oireachtas to Spain in advance of the referendum on Catalan independence as he is of the opinion that the civil rights of citizens are not being respected. We have had to deem the petition inadmissible as per Standing Order 111C(1)(a), “a petition is admissible unless it requests the Dáil to do anything other than the Dáil has power to do”. It is an interesting petition nonetheless. I am sure committee members have their views on the legality or otherwise of the forthcoming referendum. However, we are constrained by Standing Orders and, accordingly, must deem the petition inadmissible. Is that agreed?
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	Certainly. I expected you to make a political point on this.
SeanSherlock	 Chairman	2017-09-27T14:40:00+01:00	As there is no further business, the committee is adjourned.
