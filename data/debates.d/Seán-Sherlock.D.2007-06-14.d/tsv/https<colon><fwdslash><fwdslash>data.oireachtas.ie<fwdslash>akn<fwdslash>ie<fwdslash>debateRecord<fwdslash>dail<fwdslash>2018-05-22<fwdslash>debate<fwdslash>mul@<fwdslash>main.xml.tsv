[<p eid="para_563">It is blossoming like the rhododendrons in Kerry.</p>]
[<p eid="para_567">That is my point.</p>]
[<p eid="para_578">I wish to speak to amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy O’Callaghan.</p>]
[<p eid="para_580">The Labour Party will support the amendment but it behoves us to make some political points on the nature of how this legislation is beginning to unfold. It is very clear now that Sinn Féin has done a deal with the Government in respect of sentencing guidelines. What we would like to know, what the House would like to know and what the people who are looking at this legislation would like to know, is what the nature of that deal is and whether it will be published in some transparent way in order we can all have sight of what happened-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_582">-----in respect of the position that Sinn Féin has adopted on this matter.</p>, <p eid="para_583"> It is very rarely that I agree with Deputy Wallace but he is right when he says this is poor legislation designed to keep the Minister, Deputy Ross, on board. If we really examine the nature of the legislation, in his assault on official Ireland, the Minister, Deputy Ross, rails against insiders and cronyism and he has always had two targets in mind, with one being the Civil Service and the second being the Judiciary.</p>, <p eid="para_584">That is what is baffling about this cunning plan of his. Ironically, in order to "reform the Judiciary", the judges will ultimately be appointed on the advice of senior civil servants and their placemen. It is precisely what the Bill now proposes. There has been much comment on how the Bill will reduce political and judicial input but there is no attention at all on who will provide the substitute input. In our rush to depoliticise the judicial appointments process, we are being asked to put a very significant part of it into the hands of the Public Appointments Service.</p>, <p eid="para_585"> What is the Public Appointments Service element? It is a body consisting of five senior career civil or public servants, including two departmental assistant secretaries, the former chair of the Northern Ireland Civil Service commissioners and three personnel consultants. I do not see why the senior Civil Service should have any role in appointing the judges, even at the remove of appointing those who will recommend the appointments. Let us be realistic about this. The State in its various guises is by far the biggest consumer of judicial services and whereas politicians come and go, our senior civil servants – the permanent administration – are daily at the receiving end of adverse judgements and rebukes in our courts. Decisions are overturned, schemes are upset and spending plans are thrown into disarray by court decisions.</p>, <p eid="para_586"> The major differences on the bench are not those between judges appointed by different Governments. We all know that there is no pattern at all of Fine Gael judges defending their own team and having a go at Fianna Fáil Governments or <i>vice versa</i>. Neither is the major difference on the bench one between those of a liberal or a conservative disposition. The major differences are between those judges who are disposed to toe the line and those who do not.  It is between those who, from the perspective of the Executive branch of Government, know their place and those who do not.</p>, <p eid="para_587"> The judges have two basic tasks. One is to do justice in disputes between individuals and the other, perhaps more important, is to curtail the power of the State and its agencies and to confine public bodies to the rule of law; in short, it is to bell the cat. The senior mandarins who shape the future of our Civil Service should not have the same sort of say in shaping the future of our Judiciary. The amendment that speaks to common sense and good legal practice is the Fianna Fáil amendment. It strikes a good balance between lay persons and pre-existing members of the Judiciary. It is a little grubby that we are trying to make law here on judicial appointments and it has become the subject of a political deal between the Government and Sinn Féin. The Government and Sinn Féin should publish the content and elucidate on and enlighten us as to what went on between the two parties when they arrived at this deal.</p>]
[<p eid="para_650">Deputy Barrett spoke to the heart and soul of Fine Gael in regard to this matter tonight. Notwithstanding the ideological differences between all of us in this House, when somebody of Deputy Barrett's experience stands up and questions authoritatively the manner in which the legislation is proceeding and speaks so passionately about the confidence in the Judiciary of the Irish people, it has to be taken very seriously in this House. While we are all distracted by the referendum campaign taking place outside these walls, we have to be mindful of what this legislation ultimately seeks to do. It is seriously flawed as it is constructed, and that is why we have to employ common sense regarding the number of persons to be appointed to the commission. Common sense ordains that 11 members is a reasonable number. If there is a practising barrister, a practising solicitor, a chairman elected by the commission, and the other constituent members proposed by Fianna Fáil, one has a solution that seeks to mediate between opposing positions. It strikes a balance in which everyone would have confidence. When did we arrive at a situation where this House would be held hostage by the whims and vagaries of the personality of one Minister who is seeking to drive a coach and four through the Judiciary and official Ireland? The net effect of what is being created is arguably that more power is being given to the Civil Service through the Public Appointments Service, which leaves us in a very bad space in respect of this legislation. It sets a very bad precedent.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1278">I seek clarification. I am open to correction, but it seems we have voted to allow for the election of 13 members to this body. However, the arithmetic does not appear to follow.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1283">We seem to have added additional members and, according to the amendments, there could be anything up to 17 people who could be deemed to be members of the commission. We have already voted to allow for only 13 members. Could we perhaps seek some clarification on the issue? On the commission we have the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, a practising barrister, a practising solicitor-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_1285">-----a chairperson and six laypersons. We seem to have added the President of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court and the Attorney General. The Minister's amendment to increase the number of members from 13 to 17 has been defeated. We are all confused about the process and need clarity from the Government on where exactly the legislation stands.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1287">I appreciate that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1290">If I can intervene again, I appreciate the point made by the Ceann Comhairle. As legislators, we need clarity.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1292">What amendments are deemed to be admissible and which are not? We have apparently contradictory positions. Unless I am mistaken, we seem to have contradicted ourselves, which is why I seek clarification.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1294">If I am adding them correctly, 17 does not go into 13.</p>]
[<p eid="para_1303">How is it proposed that we discuss this issue? Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, might enlighten us?</p>]
