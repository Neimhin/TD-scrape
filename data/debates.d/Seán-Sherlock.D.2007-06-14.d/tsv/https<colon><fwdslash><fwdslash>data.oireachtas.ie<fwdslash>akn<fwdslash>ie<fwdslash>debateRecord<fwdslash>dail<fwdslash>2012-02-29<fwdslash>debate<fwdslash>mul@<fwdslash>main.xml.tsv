SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	Supports to business by successive Governments over many years have focused on supporting viable businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors, where the benefits to the economy of such supports significantly exceed their cost.  In continuing that approach, this Government's objective is to facilitate the creation and maintenance of the maximum number of sustainable jobs in the economy by improving the operating environment for business and focusing on companies that demonstrate growth potential.The Action Plan for Jobs 2012, which was published on 13 February, sets out a range of measures which are designed to support new business start-ups, improve enterprise competitiveness and help firms to grow.  Small and medium enterprises will benefit in particular from measures in the action plan.  These include the establishment of a new one–stop–shop structure for micro-enterprise support.  Also included is the roll-out of the micro-finance fund for small new start-ups.   The fund will go live following the finalisation of its delivery structures and the scheme's approval by the European Investment Fund.Another measure is the introduction of a new temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, which will address the problem of access to finance for viable SMEs that do not meet the normal lending criteria of the banks.  This scheme will go live as soon as possible following the enactment of primary legislation in Quarter 2 of 2012.  Other measures include the expansion of mentoring schemes, particularly between multinational companies and SMEs, and measures to improve access to public procurement opportunities for SMEs.In addition, the south east action plan, which was launched by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on 2 December last, contains specific actions to address the unemployment problems affecting the south east.  The plan identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition of having a stronger local enterprise base.  There are challenges for all agencies in the region to help build up the region's competitive advantage and then to promote it in a co-ordinated manner.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 is part of a wider, whole-of-Government response to the jobs crisis, which includes the recently published plan for labour market activation, Pathways to Work.  Both documents are fundamentally linked and recognise the need to reform our policies and structures to secure long-term and lasting results for our enterprise base and for job-seekers.The action plan sets out over 270 measures to be implemented this year to support job creation.  Pathways to Work will reform the public employment services and the further education and training services to facilitate people to access the job opportunities that become available.  Under the Pathways to Work approach, over 85,000 job experience and work placements will be made available by the Department of Social Protection this year, with a further 457,000 training and education places available through the Department of Education and Skills.  These initiatives will impact positively on all regions of the country.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I take the point the Deputy is raising.  We are being imaginative in ensuring there is a micro-finance fund for small businesses.  The new partial credit guarantee scheme is designed to help the SME sector.  If one talks about the direct subsidisation of a business - I take the point made by the Deputy on the encouragement or retention of employment within existing businesses - one must be mindful of the consequences.  Where there are two companies trading in the same sector, one thriving and the other not, and one supports directly the one that is not thriving, one must realise there are permutations regarding State aid rules on direct subsidisation.  We are, therefore, seeking to create the types of programmes to which all businesses will be able to subscribe, such that we can try to retain employment.In the two types of businesses to which the Deputy alludes, the phenomenon he described could be seen a consequence of a direct drop in consumer demand, which is having a major impact.  We must also factor that into the equation.  The Deputy's point is well made but we are trying to address the problem through programme supports and direct-credit supports for companies that are thriving and will survive.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	To be fair and objective about this, we are thinking outside the box.  Research and development tax credits will encourage greater business growth.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The Revenue job assist scheme will also help, while PRSI programmes entice employers to retain employees and there is a tax break for that purpose.  On the demand and supply side we are trying to encourage companies to retain people in jobs.  It is an extremely difficult thing to do because one must adhere to State-aid rules in doing so.  We have been imaginative in trying to get people back into the work force through labour market activation measures, including the pathways to work scheme.  We will stay on that course.  The essential point in the Deputy's question concerned a direct subsidy to individual businesses.  We are trying to take a more imaginative view on that by putting in place the temporary credit guarantee scheme and the micro-finance fund.  In addition, we are encouraging employers through tax breaks and PRSI credits.  That is the way to stimulate growth.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	The seventh EU Framework Programme for Research and Development, also known as FP7, with a budget of €55 billion for the period 2007 to 2013, is the EU's main instrument for funding research and development in Europe.  FP7 offers Ireland's SMEs, multinationals and research institutions valuable opportunities to participate in high-calibre research collaborations with our European counterparts.The framework programme enables companies to work with academic research groups and other industry players across Europe, as well as deriving the benefits associated with collaborative research.  This enables them to gain benefits such as access to knowledge networks and specialist equipment, sharing costs and risks, and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.The total funding secured by companies based in Ireland since the commencement of the seventh framework programme in 2007 - to November 2011, the latest figures available - is €87.8 million.  The figure for 2011 was €25 million and the corresponding target for 2012 is €30 million.  Of the €87.8 million secured by companies based in Ireland, €66.4 million went to SMEs and €21.4 million went to multinationals based in Ireland.The European Commission's fourth monitoring report on FP7, covering the years 2007 to 2010 and published in August 2011, states that, in one of the main funding programmes within FP7, Ireland has the highest participation rate of SMEs of the EU 27.   This is the rate of SME participation in FP7 compared to the population of SMEs in the country.  The national target for drawdown by Ireland from FP7 over the seven-year period, for both industry and research institutions, is €600 million.  To date, Ireland has secured €362 million under FP7 since it commenced in 2007.  We are on track to reach our national target of €600 million when the programme ends in 2013.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.EU support for innovation is also provided through the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, CIP, which runs from 2007 to 2013, and which has a budget of €3.6 billion.  Unlike FP7, funding under the CIP does not go directly to companies; almost 50% of the funding is via European Investment Fund, EIF, guarantees which are provided to financial intermediaries, and the remainder is used to fund actions such as best practice exchanges and provision of information networks through the Enterprise Europe Network.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Truthfully, it is not possible to say how many jobs have been created as a result of this programme.  It is important to note the number of successful applications in the SME sector is over 1,000 while in the multinational sector, it was 270.  In the SME sector, we have taken in over €66 million in funding with €21 million in the multinational sector.While it does not answer the Deputy's questions directly, it does signify the scheme is supporting existing jobs.  The criteria set down for adherence to the programme is one of excellence in terms of the research industry and academic collaboration.The key message in my reply is that if we hit the €600 million target for the current framework programme, it would be an extremely good result.  Moving into the new framework programme for 2020 which has a potential pot of €85 billion, I am ambitious for this country that we would hit or surpass the €600 million target.  That will benefit existing employment and create further jobs.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 have today been signed and simultaneously I have launched the next stage of the Copyright Review Committee review of Ireland's copyright legislation, aimed at removing barriers to innovation.  I acknowledge the desire of some interested parties that this instrument be more detailed and more prescriptive. However the High Court now has significant guidance from the European Court of Justice on the implementation of the measure, and will have to ensure any remedy provided will uphold the following principles:Freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as ISPs;The absolute requirement that an ISP cannot be required to carry out general monitoring on the information it carries on its network;Any measures must be fair and proportionate and not be unnecessarily complicated or costly;The fundamental rights of an ISPs' customers must be respected, namely their right to protection of their personal data and their freedom to receive or impart information.I believe that in Ireland we must build on our very substantial achievements in the creative and digital media industries, and become a model of international best practice for innovation in this area. Ireland is home to some of the world's most innovative internet companies, and we are determined to grow our reputation as a location where smart people and smart companies can innovate in this fast-moving arena.It was necessary for us to proceed to sign this Statutory Instrument in order to ensure compliance with our obligations under EU law. The intended purpose of the proposed Statutory Instrument is not to enact new EU legislation but rather it seeks to merely restate the position that was thought to exist within the copyright legislation prior to Justice Charleton's judgement here and in all EU Member States.  Accordingly, I am satisfied that the introduction of this measure by way of Statutory Instrument is not inconsistent with the legislative policy outlined in the Programme for Government.As there are clearly many diverse interests, it is important that interested parties come together and work in a constructive way to map the path forward. For this reason I am particularly anxious that the consultation paper launched today is studied and comprehensively responded to by all interested parties.  The challenge now is to examine what measures we can take to develop Ireland's laws in this area in such a way as to provide the greatest possible encouragement for innovation in the creative and digital industries to take place here.This is a very complex area of law, which affects industries that are developing rapidly and where the interests of many diverse and changing parties interact with each other. My ambition to make Ireland a model of international best practice in this area will not be easily achieved, and as this debate develops I urge all interested parties on all sides to come together and work in a constructive and realistic way to the benefit of all.In that context, I am committed to reviewing and updating the Copyright legislation currently in place in order to strike the correct balance between encouraging innovation and protecting creativity. This paper has been prepared by the Copyright Review Committee in response to submissions received and public engagement. I urge all interested parties, including information providers and ISPs, innovators, rights-holders, consumers and end-users, to study it carefully and engage in a constructive debate on all the issues.This is a valuable opportunity for all interested parties to express their views and to make a meaningful contribution towards shaping the future development of Irish copyright law. I am confident that the work being carried out by the Copyright Review Committee, with the interaction and input of the interested parties, will result in establishing Irish copyright law on a firm footing to encourage innovation, foster creativity and meet the challenges of the future with confidence.The independent Copyright Review Committee was established on 9th May, 2011:to examine the present national Copyright legislation and identifying any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation;to identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation;to examine the US style ‘fair use' doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context;and if it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by EU Directives on copyright and other international obligations), make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting and promoting and facilitating innovation.The membership of the independent Committee is Dr. Eoin O'Dell (Trinity College Dublin) (Chair), Patricia McGovern (DFMG Solicitors, Dublin), and Prof. Steve Hedley (University College Cork).
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	The Taskforce's recommendations outlined a whole of Government approach to realising an important strand of Ireland's economic recovery and made a wide range of recommendations in areas such as intellectual property, venture capital, the higher education system, procurement, convergence, sectoral issues, taxation, enterprise agency supports and structures, broadband infrastructure, marketing and implementation. There were 26 Key Recommendations and 63 Supporting Recommendations in the Innovation Taskforce Report. Of the 26 Key recommendations, 12 have been implemented, 9 are to be implemented, in full or in part, and finally 5 will not be implemented. In the main, the unimplemented items are recommendations regarding tax allowances or are concepts requiring significant further analysis to become implementable proposals — many of them give rise to substantial additional investment costs or to revenue foregone.Significant recommendations implemented include putting into place the €500 million Innovation Fund-Ireland to target the development of a vibrant venture capital community in Ireland through attracting top international venture capitalists. Cycle 5 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) was launched. Moreover, funding for a number of ITF recommendations in the budgetary process to 2016 were secured, enabling my Department and its agencies to support innovative companies, grow the number of high potential start-up companies, provide more venture capital and develop a portfolio of sector specific Angel Funds and increase Enterprise Ireland supports for commercialisation. They also enable the retention of a strategic mass of world class researchers who act as a pull factor for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland.Furthermore, increased funding was secured for the R&D activities of Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the context of Budget 2011 and Budget 2012 to enable Ireland to retain the science base built over the past decade, attract further R&D FDI, strengthen collaborations between researchers and enterprise, provide additional company R&D grants, and ensure the best use is made of research with commercial and market potential.The ITF recommendation to introduce incentives to encourage greater take up of higher level maths has been implemented by the introduction of a scheme of bonus points for students who sit higher level maths. The scheme is to be introduced for a four year pilot period commencing Leaving Certificate 2012 and will be reviewed in 2014. This initiative complements the recommendation to roll out Project Maths — an initiative designed to place greater emphasis on the understanding of mathematical concepts and the application of mathematical knowledge and skill — which is also being implemented.The Action Plan for Jobs contains a myriad of initiatives to support broad based innovation.The majority of public research funding will be aligned with priority areas where we are most likely to get economic returns and monitoring systems will be put in place to measure the impact of funding. This initiative was approved by Cabinet and published.Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of programmes designed to deliver world class research in third level institutions linked to Irish enterprises. Industry and academia collaborations have now reached 800 linkages across 500 companies. The remit of Science Foundation Ireland will be extended to include applied research, in addition to its existing remit covering oriented basic research, thereby enhancing the focus on commercialisation. SFI's funding will include support for Research Centres to enable them to build scale and world class in a sustainable way that fully underpins the development of industry in Ireland and the commercialisation of Irish research.IDA will continue their strategy of attracting high quality FDI projects to Ireland and more firmly embed existing FDI companies with a strong emphasis on RDI — in 2011 IDA approvals for RDI stood at €700million representing an increase of 40% from 2010. The Department of Finance is also implementing, via the Finance Bill 2012, the R&D tax credit improvements announced in the budget which will help all companies and support research and innovation generally. This year, my Department will provide €140m to Enterprise Ireland (EI) to ensure the continued growth in the capacity in indigenous Irish companies to develop innovative and cutting-edge products, processes and services.Enterprise Ireland will expand their in-company innovation capability and host a Big Ideas Showcase in 2012 to focus on securing investment and identifying business partners that will bring new technologies to the next stage of commercialisation. New Technology Centres in Cloud Computing, Learning Technologies and Financial Services will be established and preparatory work will begin on others relevant to the prioritisation exercise mentioned already. EI will also develop and pilot, in the South East, an innovation Graduates Programme managed in conjunction with the Institutes of Technology and open a call under the Innovation Voucher Scheme specifically focussed on design and branding activities for SMEs, with Third Level Institutes as providers. A second call will be launched under Innovation Fund Ireland to attract significant venture capital players to Ireland.In the area of Intellectual Property(IP) a new Protocol is being developed to manage IP arising from state funded research. Separately a feasibility study is under way to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in IP.Public Procurement is also being used as  a lever for innovation. My Department is working with Enterprise Ireland and others to develop a Procuring Innovation Initiative to increase purchasing of innovative solutions from SMEs by encouraging a more flexible approach to tendering that focuses on procuring solutions to needs rather than specific products or services.My Department is working with the Department of Health and relevant State Agencies to develop a Health Innovation Hub to drive collaboration between the health system and enterprise leading to the development and commercialisation of new healthcare technologies. There are also a number of initiatives being taken to support innovation in sectors including the Green Economy, Agri-Food, ICT, Cloud Computing, Retail and Wholesale.Innovation is cross-cutting and requires a broad based approach. The breadth of initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs to support innovation is a testament to the Government's commitment to delivering innovation policy to support our economic recovery.
