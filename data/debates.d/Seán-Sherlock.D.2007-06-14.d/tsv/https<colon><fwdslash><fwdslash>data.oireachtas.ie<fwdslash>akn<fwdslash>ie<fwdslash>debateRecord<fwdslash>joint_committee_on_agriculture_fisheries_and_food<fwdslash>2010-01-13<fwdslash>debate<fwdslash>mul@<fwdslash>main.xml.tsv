SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I, too, welcome the group.  It is important to acknowledge that there is a plurality of views on farming issues and that there are groups outside the traditional farm lobby organisations such as the IFA and ICMSA whose voices should be recognised.I will start with some of the basic assumptions.  One is that farmers are price takers, not price makers.  It is a line that is often trotted out.  Why have we arrived at that scenario?  There was a time when farmers controlled the co-operative movement.  Production and distribution networks were more localised and farmers had a greater say at local level.  In recent years, as co-operatives have become more corporatised or have been moulded into corporate entities, the voice of the farmer has dissipated.  That is relevant to the issue of why dairy farmers find themselves in their current position, whereby they must accept the price determined by the market and they are no longer actors or agents in that process.Our guests are advocating that a regulator should be appointed.  I take a similar view to Deputy Creed in respect of this matter, namely, that we do not want another layer of quasi-non-governmental organisations, quangos, being created.  There are enough such bodies and I could not support the appointment of a regulator.  However, I would advocate that fair trade legislation be introduced.  I do not understand why ICOS or the mighty co-operative movement is not lobbying the multiples at a higher level to ensure that a fairer price be paid to primary producers.I do not agree with the Government's position on a potential code of conduct.  Such a code will lack teeth and, ultimately, will not yield a proper price for farmers.  However, I support, without question, the idea that fair trade legislation should be introduced so that primary producers will retain a degree of autonomy in respect of or control over what they produce and the means by which they produce it.In most cases, there is a lack of transparency regarding the profits of the larger multiples.  Their practices in the context of how they treat primary producers are well documented.  A legislative change will be required if matters in this regard are to be placed on a more equitable footing.  In that sense, our guests should not fear; the committee is well aware of the concerns they have expressed in that regard.  Those concerns have been well documented and the committee has held numerous hearings and is working on that matter.How did our guests arrive at a figure of 6,000 with regard to the number of dairy farmers who ceased production last year?  I am not questioning the veracity of that figure, but I would like our guests to identify its source.  They stated that in 2004 there were 24,000 dairy farmers, whereas in 2009 this had fallen to 18,000.  Will they indicate from where these figures originated?Is today's market price for milk as low as 19 cent per litre?  I think there has been an increase in that regard.  Perhaps our guests produced their document a long time ago and the price has not been updated.I take issue with our guests' approach to dairy farmers selling to the highest paying processor.  I am operating on the assumption that most dairy farmers are members of co-operative movements.  What, therefore, would be the permutations for a dairy farmer who is a shareholder in the Dairygold Co-Operative Society Limited?  Why would he or she want to sell to another co-operative entity?  I would have thought that people would have a vested interest in selling to their own co-ops because, theoretically, there would be a financial yield to them at some point in the future.
