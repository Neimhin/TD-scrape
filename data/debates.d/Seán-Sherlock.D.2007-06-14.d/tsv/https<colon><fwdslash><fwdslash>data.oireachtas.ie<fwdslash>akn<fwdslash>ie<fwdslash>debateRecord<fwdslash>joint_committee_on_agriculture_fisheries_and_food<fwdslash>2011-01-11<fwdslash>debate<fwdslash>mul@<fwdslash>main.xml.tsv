SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome Mr. Moran and his colleagues to the joint committee.  I want to address the issue of the special share.  What is the distinction between a special share and a golden share?  The suggestion by Mr. Moran is that the decision to cease production was laid firmly and squarely at Greencore's door, and neither the Department nor the Government of the day had any input into that decision because the quota was owned by Irish Sugar.  My understanding of the import of the special share is that it was held by the Government.  It had the same monetary value as any other share, but conditions were attached which meant that Greencore could not dispose of the controlling interests in Irish Sugar without the prior consent of the Minister of the day.  The former Minister, Mr. Michael Smith, told the Dáil at the time that the special share in Greencore did not allow the Minister, acting on behalf of the State, to contribute to the decision made by Greencore on the renunciation of the quota.  The proposed actions by Greencore, which required the Minister's consent under the terms associated with the special share, were related to any changes to certain specified articles of the articles of association - the voluntary winding up of Greencore, the sale of more than 49% of Irish Sugar plc, a subsidiary of Greencore, and the creation of a new class of share in Greencore.  Legal advice obtained at the time was that they did not include provision for the Minister to direct Greencore in regard to the sugar quota.  Greencore was the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota.Irish Sugar, Cómhlucht Siúcre Éireann Teoranta, predates the foundation of the European Union and Ireland's accession to the European Union in 1973.  It was set up by the State as a State company.  For the life of me, I do not understand the mechanism in regard to the golden or special share.  The Irish people and polity reasonably understood that the basis of that share was such that it would be held in perpetuity for the people and that it would have, by its very nature and character, conveyance of certain powers for the people.  We have been told by the Secretary General and the Minister that is not the case and that was so relinquished.  Therefore, the import, or net result, of that was that it was handed over lock, stock and barrel to a corporate entity which could do whatever it wanted to do, that the State, once it reached a decision in regard to the negotiation on the overhaul of the sugar regime, had no power or effect whatsoever and that a corporate entity, Greencore, had the ultimate power in terms of renouncing the quota.  To my mind, that is nothing short of national sabotage.What it signals is that the Government of the day literally handed over an industry which had been here since the 1920s and which was founded by Irish men and women for the people.  It was effectively handed over to a corporate entity, the likes of which paid some of its representatives the sum of €4.6 million last year.  The four top executives in Greencore, the food group, took home a cumulative €4.56 million last year, a rise of 55%.  This industry has been sold from under the feet of the people and not even with a bang but with a whimper, to misquote the poet T. S. Eliot.  That is the past.I hail from the town of Mallow and believe there could be potential but we must be very realistic about what we want to achieve from this day onwards.  I would like a straight answer to the following question.  Can the State carry out a feasibility study to ascertain whether we can start to produce sugar again for its own marketability or ethanol in order that we can offset some of the costs of importation of undenatured ethanol from third countries like Brazil, which is what we are doing?The other inherent contradiction is that for €20 million or so less, by way of compensation to cover dismantling costs, the State could have maintained the facility at Mallow.  We have been told by various experts that if we are to kick-start the industry, it will cost us €500 million plus.  If we had decided to retain the factory, could the State have stated to Greencore that it would take on that facility for a negotiable sum in order that the State, as an entity, could have done what it wanted with that factory?The Oireachtas recently passed the biofuels obligation scheme.  The biofuels obligation scheme is a transposition of a European directive, which basically means that we must put a certain percentage of biofuels into our petrol or diesel tanks on a daily basis.  The irony of it is that we are importing that and Whitegate and the big oil companies started importing undenatured ethanol from third countries a number of years ago in anticipation of the transposition of this directive.When the biofuels obligation scheme legislation came before the Dáil, the Labour Party put forward amendments to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to ask that we would look at imposing a tariff on undenatured ethanol imports from third countries so that we could kick-start this industry.  The irony of it is that there was a ready-made factory in Mallow which could have taken up that slack to produce ethanol, either from beet or from other sources, which would meet that particular need.  That factory is gone.  It seems to me that it is gone because of a lack of oversight, a lack of foresight and a lack of vision, which was the same type of vision which created the Irish sugar industry in the first instance.How will we go back to basics and what can we do to restimulate this industry?  Can we, as a starting point, bring all of the stakeholders together, including Government, all of the Departments involved and the farming organisations, to at least see if the State could fund the cost of a feasibility study to see if it is viable, either for ethanol production or for sugar production?We are hampered by the fact that we cannot access quota, and that is a political decision that has been made.  However, for the period after 2015 and for long-term planning - I refer not to two or three years hence but to 20 years down the road when there may be a renegotiation of the sugar quota and other such quotas - we could put in place some sort of a feasibility study so that we can start thinking in the long term about kick-starting an industry where farmers want to grow the beet and there is a generation of workers out there who are still young enough to have that knowledge to put together the infrastructure again.  That is the kind of thinking we want to see.There is nothing in Mr. Moran's statement that would give me any grounds for hope.  Effectively, he stated that it was a commercial decision by the company and that the State abdicated by virtue of the fact that it had relinquished its special share or that special share having no particular weight.  He also stated that it is not possible to produce sugar for export outside the EU and there is no mechanism under the present regulations that would allow for the reinstatement of the sugar quota for growing of sugar beet in Ireland.Mr. Moran is not giving us any grounds for hope today.  I want to hear from Mr. Moran, who is arguably a key decision maker as Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a massive budget in this country.  I want to hear a new kind of language coming from civil servants that asks if we can look at a feasibility study to see if we can kick-start this industry.  Those are the kinds of statements my party wants to hear in this committee today.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Would the Department consider engaging with the stakeholders interested in putting forward proposals or at least consider having an exchange of views with viable stakeholders who wish to kick-start projects?  I accept at face value and in good faith the offer made of support with regard to approaches to Enterprise Ireland, but will the Department engage with stakeholders on the issue of the feasibility study?  Will either the Secretary General or his colleagues within the Department become involved in direct consultation?
