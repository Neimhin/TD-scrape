[<p eid="para_70">I thank the three witnesses for their very comprehensive opening statements. I also thank Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing the Bill forward, which the Labour Party will be supporting. I hail from the town of Mallow. It would not be fair to say that I was born in the flood but I was certainly baptised in the flood. I live less than 100 paces from the River Blackwater. If I threw a stone from my house, it would pretty much land in the Blackwater. I have first-hand experience of flooding incidences on the Munster Blackwater and I know that the schemes that have been put in place in Mallow and Fermoy demonstrably work. There is clear evidence that they work.</p>, <p eid="para_71">There is no ambiguity about that whatsoever. The system of demountables that has been put in place has been extremely successful. I know of only one breach, which was in a very particular location and was due to an electrical fault on a pump, in the past ten years, and it has since been fixed. I, therefore, see no reason whatsoever for any entity or party to hold back flood insurance from any premises or business within the floodplains of Fermoy and Mallow. I concur with Deputy McGrath that we should not have to seek a legislative solution to this issue.</p>, <p eid="para_72"> What is the perception of the three witnesses of the memorandum of understanding and how it is operating as it relates to the OPW and Insurance Ireland? It appears to me that it merely seeks to share information and does not go beyond that. There does not appear to be any statement of principles. For instance, when the OPW kicks the tyres on a successful flood alleviation project, the OPW's word does not seem sufficient within that memorandum of understanding, MOU, to give assurances to any constituent member of Insurance Ireland that it can proceed to provide insurance in any areas covered by flood alleviation works. There seems to be a complete flaw in that regard. That is my first point and my first question.</p>, <p eid="para_73"> My second point - I would like the witnesses' perception of this - concerns something I find incongruous and contradictory about the involvement of a global player such as Arup. Arup's consulting engineers were engaged to assess the flood relief scheme in Mallow. The Lagan Group provided the consulting engineers on the second phase. Arup is a globally recognised company. It did not come to Mallow and carry out the works it did without itself having insurance. There are more than 100 names, including some very big ones, on the list of Insurance Ireland's members. Starting with the As, there is Accenture, American International Group, AIG, and Alliance; going down the list, there is Lloyds and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, BBVA. It is fair to assume that any one of these members of Insurance Ireland probably provided Arup with some degree of cover for the works it carried out. Therefore, it seems to me a contradiction that Insurance Ireland is happy to provide cover for consulting engineers who might provide works and kick the tyres on the works carried out, which then pass muster, and does not then provide cover after the fact, after the works have been successful - it is incontrovertible that they have been successful - for the people who benefit from the very schemes provided by companies such as Lagan and Arup. There is an inherent contradiction here. Furthermore, we are at a disadvantage here because Insurance Ireland always comes before the Oireachtas with one person as the representative of all of these insurance houses. I contend that we need to hear from individual voices who have provided insurance cover in the past but who do not have the guts, quite frankly, to come before us and give an account of their actions. I would like to hear from the witnesses how they perceive the contradictions I have just outlined.</p>, <p eid="para_74"> I want to ask another, more specific question. It is a very simple question. Forgive me if it is a stupid one. I have always thought that the principles of insurance cover were such that an insurance house or company was legally obliged to provide a quote and therefore had to provide cover. Mr. Kavanagh spoke about the issue of excess but, regarding instances of people I know and people he knows not being able to get insurance, I always thought there was a provision governing the principles of providing insurance that one had to at least provide a quote for cover. Perhaps the witnesses could provide me with some information on that.</p>, <p eid="para_75"> I will leave it at that for now. With the Chairman's indulgence, I might come back in for one more bite of the cherry.</p>]
[<p eid="para_79">The MOU is not working-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">I have one final question. Mr. Kavanagh referred earlier to the risk profile. The risk profile, as I understand it, has become so low. Is there something that needs to be done from an OPW point of view regarding mapping? I am aware of mapping that has been used by insurance companies. They sit at the desk, a customer phones them, they look at the map and they say the customer has been kicked out of the system because the map in the first instance is the guide they use. Could we do something to address the mapping issue beyond the mere desktop? In other words, if we started drilling down into the histories, the amount of moneys that have been spent on demountables, flood alleviation works, arterial drainage and so on, we could start to create a more accurate picture of what is actually happening in reality.</p>, <p eid="para_83">I contend, and I would like to hear the witnesses' perceptions and opinions on this, that the OPW probably has to push harder against Insurance Ireland, in terms of how the memorandum of understanding actually operates.</p>]
[<p eid="para_85">Mr. Kavanagh mentioned Cork County Council. Historically, very clear protocols were set in place, whereby early warning systems in place for local authority staff are in towns such as Mallow and Fermoy. It is pertinent we are speaking about Mallow and Fermoy because they will have a bearing on what happens in Cork city down the line, in terms of their early warning systems, which are now so robust that the response times of staff in local authorities are extraordinary. They are <i>par excellence</i>. This is because of the historical nature of flooding events. What I am trying to glean, and we will have an opportunity to ask the Minister, is where the local authorities actually feed into the OPW processes on early warning systems and those exchanges of information. What Mr. Kavanagh has articulated is that there is still a gap between Insurance Ireland and the OPW on a raft of issues that need to be articulated and highlighted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_87">It is robust.</p>]
[<p eid="para_261">I will return to the demountable defences for a second. Mr. Thompson gave clear examples, four in total, which are all from the UK. Let us work through the examples. In 2007 in Upton-upon-Severn "the demountable defence was not deployed in time due to severe disruption to the transport infrastructure caused by flooding." What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_263">That is fine. In Hereford "a faulty sensor caused the failure of a demountable defence". What happened there?</p>]
[<p eid="para_265">And "the Foss barrier failed after its pumping station flooded."</p>]
[<p eid="para_267">In Wales, "a temporary steel defence was not erected in time".</p>]
[<p eid="para_269">I am looking at those four examples and Mr. Thompson also mentioned examples on the Dodder in 2011 and in Limerick. I do not know in what year the Limerick example occurred.</p>]
[<p eid="para_271">What happened exactly in those two examples?</p>]
[<p eid="para_273">Do the witnesses attribute those two examples to human intervention, or the lack of such intervention?</p>]
[<p eid="para_275">Mr. Thompson spoke about protocols for deployment. To what extent are Insurance Ireland and its constituent members drilling down into the deployment protocols in respect of pending or rising flood waters? Take, for example, the Blackwater flows through Mallow and Fermoy, where there are demountable defences. To what extent have Insurance Ireland's constituent members seen at first hand or examined the protocols which exist in respect of those two towns' defences?</p>]
[<p eid="para_277">As I said in the previous session, I live in Mallow. I know Mallow and Fermoy intimately. I know that there is incontrovertible evidence that there are currently no risks in Mallow. It is a similar case in Fermoy. I am a little bit worried that Insurance Ireland is depending on the OPW, and on the information which flows up directly from local authorities to the OPW, to make decisions. I am worried that insurers are not actually going out on the ground when flooding events occur. I contend that Insurance Ireland's flood working group depends solely on what comes through from the local authorities, via the OPW and into this forum which Insurance Ireland has with the OPW. Mr. Thompson used the word "anecdotally". I do not want to up the ante on the rhetoric but "anecdotally" does not cut the mustard. I hope the witness will bear with me.</p>]
[<p eid="para_279">It is easy to deploy resources when there is a flood pending. It does not involve a big cost. It is a matter of sending somebody down to observe. Insurance Ireland's members need to be on the ground observing what is happening in real time for themselves. Insurance Ireland's members hold 95% of the domestic insurance market and 85% of the international life insurance market in this country. I do not see why they cannot go down to places such as Fermoy, Mallow and other areas which have been covered by capital works carried out by organisations such as the Lagan Group and Arup. Arup is a global leader. It carried out the flood alleviation works in Mallow.</p>, <p eid="para_280">Arup recently conducted a study with Lloyds of London on offsetting or mitigating against risk for catastrophes owing to climate change in global cities. Lloyds is a member of Insurance Ireland. I acknowledge Mr. Thompson will not be able to respond to this but when Arup was doing the flood alleviation works as consulting engineers, its cover for insurance was being provided by one of the witness's constituent groups. I find it incongruous that Arup could be covered by one of Insurance Ireland's constituent groups and the works could be stood over but that after the fact, the people who rely on those works could not be covered by one of his constituent groups. Can Mr. Thompson understand the level of anger that exists in this regard? I believe some members of Insurance Ireland have already decided they absolutely and utterly will not provide flood cover regardless of what protocols Insurance Ireland puts in place or are covered by the memorandum of understanding, MOU. They have just taken a corporate decision. Mr. Thompson himself mentioned the profitability and risk profile earlier and because of that, they are just not going to get into or are withdrawing entirely from this market. </p>]
[<p eid="para_282">Is that a formal structure?</p>]
[<p eid="para_284">Or is it informal or anecdotal?</p>]
[<p eid="para_286">That is okay.</p>]
[<p eid="para_289">I will come at this another way. Mallow and Fermoy are classical examples of where the State has expended vast taxpayer resources to ensure that flood plains and the people in those areas are protected. They have worked. Does Mr. Thompson agree they have worked?</p>]
[<p eid="para_291">They have worked to date. Mr. Thompson is qualifying it. He remains to be convinced about the very protocols that have been tried and tested in towns like Mallow over decades, not years. This constitutes decades of corporate memory of the local authority where staff intergenerationally has clear systems put in place in both those towns. They are typical of examples throughout the country where flood works have been carried out. Mr. Thompson still appears to be doubting those very protocols because he said that Insurance Ireland deployed staff in Storm Ophelia. I defy anybody to have gone out on the Monday of Storm Ophelia because one would not put anyone outside the door on that day. He is referring to deploying after the fact and not before the fact. There must be a greater degree of willingness on the part of Insurance Ireland to drill down further and to start talking to local authority officials. As somebody who lives in the town, the process by which one would do that is not as formal, as formulaic or as systematic as I would like. I live 100 paces from the Blackwater River and I still have not seen the evidence of this happening in real time. Mr. Thompson has stated there are two processes, one being Insurance Ireland's own working groups and the other being through the OPW process. I would bet any money that the next time there is a pending flood in Mallow, one will not see any constituent member of Insurance Ireland going down there to talk to local authority officials or taking notes on whether the demountables are working. Incidentally, they clearly are working but I guarantee there is no process in place for that.</p>]
[<p eid="para_293">Mr. Thompson might give me a straight answer; he does not have to qualify it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_295">Let me put it in another way. Is it true that Mr. Thompson will know when the next flooding incident will occur on the Munster Blackwater?</p>]
[<p eid="para_297">No, I do not mean not after the fact. I refer to Insurance Ireland being serious about increasing coverage from 83% - the figure Mr. Thompson mentioned earlier - as there is still 17% to go. The members of Insurance Ireland cover 95% of the market. Mr. Thompson has told us that he wants to extend and grow the coverage. However, everything he is saying points to there still being many hoops to be jumped. Can Insurance Ireland or its constituent members give us an undertaking? In his own submission, Mr. Thompson has poured doubts over whether the legislation will work and over the Flood Re example in the UK. He is saying that the MOU is everything. It is the ship on which the insurance industry will sail. We have kicked the tyres on the MOU and no one here is absolutely convinced that the MOU is working. What we are trying to do, piecemeal, is work through a system whereby Insurance Ireland's members can be absolutely and utterly convinced that they have witnessed at first hand how the demountables are working because the witness is throwing doubt over the demountables. That is the evidence Mr. Thompson is giving here and he has cited two Irish examples. I want to ensure that Insurance Ireland and its members will be confident that the human error protocols that are put in place, for instance, by Cork County Council are so robust as to ensure the risk is absolutely and utterly mitigated. The only way I can be convinced of that is if people from the insurance industry are deployed on the ground when the early warning system kicks in and that there is a transparent protocol, to speak to Dr. Surminski's point, whereby we can all see that the insurance industry has been down there and is satisfied that the systems have worked.</p>]
[<p eid="para_301">What does that mean?</p>]
[<p eid="para_303">Chairman, I want to be very clear here. There is nobody talking about discarding the MOU here. However, all the MOU provides for is an exchange of information. There are no obligations inherent within the MOU. Would Mr. Thompson agree?</p>]
[<p eid="para_305">That is all it is about.</p>]
[<p eid="para_307">Consider for instance the UK model, in which there are eight guiding principles. I am not going to articulate what the principles are, but it could be contended that some of them could, in principle, be incorporated into the MOU as well. We would not be distorting competition. This would allow for pricing that reflects risk, which would deal with the excess issue. This would allow investment in flood risk-management activity and sustainable long-term approaches to flooding insurance.</p>, <p eid="para_308"> We have to kick the tyres on the MOU, because that is the only avenue that we have, as individual Members of the Oireachtas, to advocate for those who do not have flood insurance at the moment. Insurance Ireland needs to come a little bit further more quickly.</p>, <p eid="para_309"> Some of Mr. Thompson's language is encouraging, I will say that. He talks about a rate of coverage of 83% and efforts to increase that rate. We need to see the evidence of that much sooner. That is why my final question to him is this: has he received any correspondence, or had any discussions, with any of Insurance Ireland's members who stated absolutely and utterly that all the demountables in the world would not change their position of not providing insurance cover? Have any of Insurance Ireland's members ever come to Mr. Thompson and said that they would not provide cover, regardless of how much is spent and no matter what is done on rivers, river basins, arterial drainage schemes or whatever? Have any of his members said that they are getting out of that market and coverage is not going to happen?</p>]
[<p eid="para_311">No? Is Mr. Thompson absolutely sure about that?</p>]
[<p eid="para_313">None of Insurance Ireland's members have said to Mr Thompson, definitively, that they are not going to cover flood insurance where demountables have been put in place.</p>]
[<p eid="para_315">This refers to Mr. Thompson's OPW working group. Not all of the 100 members are on the OPW working group.</p>]
[<p eid="para_317">I thank Mr. Thompson.</p>]
