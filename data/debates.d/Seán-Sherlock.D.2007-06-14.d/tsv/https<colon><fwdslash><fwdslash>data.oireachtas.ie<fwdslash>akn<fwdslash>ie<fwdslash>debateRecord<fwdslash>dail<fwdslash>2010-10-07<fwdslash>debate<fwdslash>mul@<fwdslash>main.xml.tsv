SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Will the Government be making any further forays into the area of animal welfare legislation?  Can the Tánaiste indicate when the animal health and welfare Bill will be introduced?  I find it strange that it is not possible to indicate the position with that Bill because commitments were given on this legislation.There are 250,000 workers who are party to defined benefit pension schemes.  They face a nightmare in terms of the returns from such schemes.  Could time be made available to the House to discuss this issue because many of the schemes are underperforming?  This is a vital issue so we should arrange a debate in this House or a discussion with the Pensions Board on the funding of those schemes.
