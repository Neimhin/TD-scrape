SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T13:00:00+00:00	I wish to raise the issue of the welfare of children throughout the State. Today we had the publication of the HIQA report on the special care units at Coovagh, Ballydowd and Glenaulin in Cork. We have had numerous HIQA reports on child protection, foster care, residential care, adoption and so on. We do not, as yet, have an affordable childcare scheme. We have been told it will be rolled out in November 2019. We have serious issues in respect of Tusla and the absence of social workers and social care workers. We also have serious issues around residential respite places for children with intellectual disabilities. I ask that provision be made to discuss services for children across the State and across a whole range of areas. There is a lack of urgency on the part of Government on a number of issues to do with the welfare of children.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T15:20:00+00:00	I wish to raise the issue of the decline in water quality at Bellvelly on the great island of Cobh. I was contacted by residents of the area who told me that on Monday last Irish Water lifted a "Do not use" notice. The company stated that customers could resume normal usage of the water for drinking, food preparation, brushing teeth and other domestic use. The notice was lifted following consultation with the HSE and the receipt of satisfactory monitoring results indicating the new water supply was safe to drink. Councillor Cathal Rasmussen and I met the residents last Monday evening after the Irish Water notice was lifted and we were given recent samples of the water. If I could bring one of the samples to the House, I would do so. I am not a scientist, but it was clear that the water was not suitable for human consumption or other domestic use. It was very discoloured. It is normal practice for Members to try to work through any issues in respect of water supply or sanitary issues in our constituencies with Irish Water, but we have been going around the houses on this issue for some time and I felt compelled to raise it in the House. Several affected families want a solution to this problem which has been going on for 20 years. They want the restoration of a safe supply of potable water that can be used for showering and other everyday domestic use. They want a water supply similar to that enjoyed by the rest of the country. That is their right. Irish Water should not have lifted the "Do not use" notice on Monday because it is very clear that the water is of insufficient quality and something has gone wrong in the system. The residents will not use the water and they have no confidence in Irish Water.They can present evidence of the fact that the water is still very discoloured, notwithstanding the flushing of the network. The Minister of State will tell the House that this has been done and that a pH correction has already been inputted into the water system. I can tell him now that the water quality is not what it should be. The "do not use" notice should not have been issued. We want a response from the Minister of State that states clearly that there will be capital investment to ensure the residents of Belvelly have an adequate and proper water supply.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T15:30:00+00:00	I appreciate the Minister of State's reply. He has given me some comfort with his assurance that he will raise the issue with Irish Water. That is to be welcomed. Although I am not a scientist, I have seen the water samples that were presented on Monday at approximately 8.30 p.m. The "do not use" notice had been lifted some time on Monday morning or afternoon. The residents of Belvelly have no confidence in the water supply. We want Irish Water to be called to account for the lifting of the "do not use" notice. There are serious public safety and public health issues for the residents. They are being told by Irish Water that they can drink the water now, but they see clear discolouration when they look at the water. There are children, babies, older people and people with compromised health living in the community. People want to have confidence that their water supply is as it should be. We want to see an evidence base or benchmark for the quality assurance used by Irish Water. We do not know how, or against what benchmark, Irish Water is measuring what qualifies as or what constitutes good or bad water. The point I would make about the flushing of the pipes is that the water supply infrastructure is very old and Dickensian. It needs capital investment. In light of the number of people living in the Belvelly area - I have been told that up to 175 houses are affected - I am asking for a solution to be found. If we can find â‚¬500 million for a rainy day fund, I am sure we can divest a fraction of that amount to start fixing problems like this. Notwithstanding the Minister of State's comments, there is a wider issue with how Irish Water sometimes communicates with Members of the Oireachtas. The relationship is very positive at local level, but further up the food chain the level of engagement with Members tends to diminish from time to time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T15:30:00+00:00	So have mine, to be honest.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T15:30:00+00:00	No, I said that the pipes are Dickensian.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-14T15:30:00+00:00	They did not take samples from the taps in people's houses.
