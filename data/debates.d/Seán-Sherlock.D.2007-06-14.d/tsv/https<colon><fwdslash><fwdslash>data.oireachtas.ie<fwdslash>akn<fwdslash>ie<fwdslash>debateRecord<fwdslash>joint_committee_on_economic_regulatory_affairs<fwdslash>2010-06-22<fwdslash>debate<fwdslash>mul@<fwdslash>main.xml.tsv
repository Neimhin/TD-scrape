[<p eid="para_34">I welcome Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and her colleagues to the committee.  I thank her on behalf of my party for her comprehensive presentation.  I have one critique of it which I might respectfully put to her.</p>, <p eid="para_35">The composition of the working group, which was set out in the acknowledgements, seems to exclude the credit union movement.  The credit union representative bodies seem to have been omitted.  They represent more than 400 credit unions and provide personal credit to almost 3 million members.  We all subscribe to the efficacy of reports from the Law Reform Commission.  On reading the report, it is my view that one cannot have such a report without their input.  I acknowledge the work done by the Law Reform Commission on behalf of the State but no report on personal debt management and debt enforcement could stand up to scrutiny without the inclusion of the representatives of the credit union movement.  That is a layman's view.</p>, <p eid="para_36">Those who participated in the report seem to be more weighted in favour of the banking federation which would not be friendly towards the credit union movement.  Perhaps the latter group could be brought on board as part of the consultative process.</p>, <p eid="para_37">Point 1.07 on page 11 indicated that the consultation paper also noted that no arrears management code exists in respect of non-mortgage debts and so suggested that consideration should be given to introducing such a code.  Mrs. Justice McGuinness indicated: "The final topic considered in the area of responsible arrears management was the provisional recommendation of the commission that a system for the regulation of the debt collection industry should be established.  I note the word "provisional".  I do not understand why that would be a provisional arrangement.  Is the Law Reform Commission not aware that there are private, unregulated firms charging astronomical commission to persons in severe debt for managing their accounts?  I recently came across a case where a couple were being charged approximately €100 per month, €1,200 per annum, by one such company.  I do not believe one can consider personal indebtedness without examining those companies as well.  In the new regulatory regime there is a sense that many of those types of companies are going to slip under the radar and that the credit unions and banks will receive much of the focus, perhaps rightly so, but that the other companies would slip away.  I would like to hear the delegation's views in this regard.</p>]
[<p eid="para_48">The commission's report on personal debt states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_49">In December 2009, the Financial Regulator published data on mortgage arrears and repossessions based on the quarter to the end of September 2009.  These statistics provide an insight into the difficulties being experienced by Irish households in meeting mortgage loan repayments.  The statistics illustrated that of a total of 791,634 private residential mortgage loans, 8,504 were in arrears for a period of between 91 and 180 days.</p>, <p eid="para_50">Are mortgages with interest-only or reduced repayment arrangements included in these arrears figures?</p>]
[<p eid="para_52">The report also states: "The number of possession claims brought in the High Court rose by 22% in 2009, with 974 such claims brought in 2009, compared to 759 in 2008."  I assume these figures have changed.  Are there projections for repossessions in 2010 and 2011?</p>]
[<p eid="para_56">To what extent are parents who acted as guarantors to their children's mortgages or those who released equity from their homes included in these statistics?</p>]
[<p eid="para_59">If the Oireachtas is to introduce effective legislation in this area, it must address the collation of accurate statistics on who is affected, an area this committee should examine.</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">Would the creation of a standard financial statement go a long way to offsetting those types of problems?</p>]
[<p eid="para_84">What is the status of statutory codes?</p>]
[<p eid="para_88">In layman's terms, if a financial body subscribed to a voluntary code, could it be pertinent to any evidence to a court?</p>]
