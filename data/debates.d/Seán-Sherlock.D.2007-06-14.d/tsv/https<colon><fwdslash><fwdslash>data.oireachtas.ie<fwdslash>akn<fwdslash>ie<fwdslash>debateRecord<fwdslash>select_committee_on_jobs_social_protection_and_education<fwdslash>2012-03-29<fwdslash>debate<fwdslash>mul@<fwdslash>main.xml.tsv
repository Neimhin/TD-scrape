[<p eid="para_38">I thank the committee members for their welcome.  With regard to the choreography, should I address all the grouped amendments in one fell swoop?</p>]
[<p eid="para_40">That is fine.  The proposed amendments are not accepted.  Amendments Nos. 1, 9 and 14 are rejected as there is no question of the abolition of the Teaching Council.  Education is at the heart of this Government's ambition to build a more cohesive, equal and successful society and economy, and teachers are at the heart of education.  The Teaching Council has a central role in delivering on the education reform agenda in ensuring that we have quality teachers to meet the challenges ahead.  The full implementation of the Teaching Council Act, when possible, will support a cohesive framework of teacher education, professionalism and registration based on quality inputs across the whole continuum of teacher education.  It is hoped to commence the few but critically important remaining sections as soon as is practicable.</p>, <p eid="para_41">The Teaching Council's work directly impacts on the attainment of the strategic high-level goals of the Department of Education and Skills.  It has a central role in effecting the change necessary for implementation, for example, of the literacy and numeracy strategy, junior cycle reform and requirements for robust teacher induction processes.  Its statutory responsibilities of maintaining, promoting and improving standards of teaching are key to supporting the Department's priority of improving the quality, relevance and inclusiveness of education for every learner in our schools.</p>, <p eid="para_42">As the professional standards body for the teaching profession, the Teaching Council seeks to set and uphold high professional standards for teaching and teachers.  It does this in the interests of pupils and the public good but equally for the reputation and status of the profession.  Quality of teaching has been determined as the single most influential factor towards achieving good educational outcomes for students.  The work of the council is focused towards the maintenance and improvement of the standards of teaching.</p>, <p eid="para_43">Developments that have taken place or are under way include: developing and implementing a continuum of education which links the professional, education and training needs throughout all phases of a teacher's career; restructuring and extending the  programmes of initial teacher education so newly qualified teachers are better equipped for the needs of the modern day classroom; reviewing and accrediting teacher education programmes; putting in place higher qualification and teacher education standards for teachers in the three sectors of primary, post-primary and further education; putting in place strict good character and Garda vetting requirements; publishing a code of professional conduct for teachers, which is currently being revised; preparing to put in place induction and probation procedures for newly qualified or registered teachers; preparing for fitness to teach procedures and processes; developing a continuing professional development framework for teachers; promoting research and engaging in debate on policy issues related to education; and enhancing the status of the profession and promoting teaching as a career.  A new council has just been appointed on March 28 for a period of four years and I and my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Quinn and Cannon, look forward to working with the council to advance our common goals.</p>, <p eid="para_44">The effect of amendment No. 10 would be to require the Teaching Council to provide an up-to-date online register listing available teachers to the Minister and each vocational education committee.  This would place an additional requirement on the Teaching Council to monitor the availability of registered teachers for employment, which is not appropriate to the remit of the Teaching Council.  The council's role is fundamentally to regulate the teaching profession and therefore I will not be accepting this amendment.</p>, <p eid="para_45">There are already administrative arrangements in place to prioritise the appointment of unemployed registered teachers.  Under Circular 31/2011, issued by the Department of Education and Skills in summer 2011, schools are required to keep a list of those appropriately qualified registered teachers who inform the school that they are available for substitute teaching work.  Teachers who are in receipt of an occupational pension must be excluded from this list, thereby prioritising unemployed teachers over those in receipt of a pension.  Where the school wishes to source a teacher for short-term substitution duties, the above list or national services such as SubSearch or TextaSub should be utilised to source a registered teacher who is not in receipt of an occupational pension.  Only where an appropriately qualified registered teacher who is not retired is unavailable should the school move to employ an appropriately qualified and registered retired teacher.  The above regulations seek to provide the greatest possible opportunity for unemployed and newly qualified teachers while safeguarding the policy of the Department, which is that, to the greatest extent possible, only appropriately qualified and registered teachers should be employed in our schools.</p>, <p eid="para_46">Amendment No. 11 seeks to ensure that a person could not be employed in place of a registered teacher without this being governed by ministerial regulation.  As written, the provision states that where the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary to facilitate the urgent temporary or occasional staffing needs of recognised schools, he or she may from time to time prescribe regulations governing the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed in place of a registered teacher and any condition that might attach to that employment.  Those conditions could relate to a maximum time limit for his or her employment and the purposes for which he or she is employed.  The Act does not give the Minister discretion to do anything else through which an unregistered person could be employed in a teaching post.</p>, <p eid="para_47">Therefore, if the Minister does not make regulations specifying the circumstances in which an unregistered person may be employed, such a person cannot be employed.  The Oireachtas is only permitting this to be done by regulation and not by any other instrument.  Amendment No. 11 is therefore unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.</p>, <p eid="para_48">With regard to amendment No. 12, the phrase of employing an unregistered person "in place of a registered teacher" is used in certain places in the new section 24, in subsections 8(<i>a</i>), 10(<i>a</i>) and 10(<i>f</i>).  However, there are also references to teaching positions in subsections 9(<i>a</i>), 10(<i>a</i>) and 10(<i>b</i>).  The reality is that in the very limited exceptions in which the employment of an unregistered person will be permitted, that person will be engaged in a teaching post.  The wording is simply designed to reflect this.  The fact that a person employed in such a post does not make him or her a teacher.  The amendment proposed is therefore unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_61">We must defer to the expertise of the Deputies in these areas.  If one is to look at the Teaching Council, one could argue that the Teaching Council and this committee should have a qualitative analysis of the role of the Teaching Council in May.  I do not want to be controversial.  Some 22 of 37 members of the Teaching Council are teachers or are allied to the teaching profession through representative organisations.  Rather than the State or the Department dealing with qualitative issues, the conversation could happen in the committee.  With due respect to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, I cannot comment on the outcome or the number of people who voted in elections.  I take the point that the low turnout may reflect a certain annoyance.  The way to deal with this, if I may be so bold as to suggest it, is for the committee to engage with the Teaching Council on its qualitative role.  With 22 of the 37 members of the council allied to the teaching profession, many things can be worked out.  The new board is <i>in situ</i>, which should give grounds for hope.  It could serve as a potential new departure in dealing with the issues Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan raised.</p>, <p eid="para_62">Regarding Deputy Smith's comments, qualifications for entry to the profession are set by the Teaching Council.  The Minister has the power to determine what qualifications the teacher should have for a publicly paid job, such as a special needs assistants or a resource teacher.  The right to set the qualification exists under the Education Act 1998.</p>, <p eid="para_63">Regarding registration delays, a new teacher is registered within two weeks of application.  We readily accept there is a resource issue with vetting.  With 40,000 teachers, it will take time for the vetting process to succeed and be expedited.  The point is well made and we accept the concerns raised by the Deputy.  The Government is seeking to work through the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_65">There is a dialogue to be had on this point.  It is a continuing challenge.  I will relate this point to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, to see how it can be addressed.</p>]
[<p eid="para_69">A working group has been set up on this point.  It involves stakeholders, including unions, the Teaching Council and the Department.  I am happy to facilitate the process or relay the message to ask the Minister to communicate directly on that issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_77">It is a technical amendment, not a qualitative judgment on educational disadvantage.  I do not accept amendment No. 2.  The definition of educational disadvantage as currently laid down in statute is not being amended but section 2 of the 1998 Act is amended to restore the definition of educational disadvantage.  The rationale for section 4(<i>a</i>) of the Bill is to safeguard the definition of educational disadvantage as currently laid down in statute.  The provision in the Bill is not to alter the definition of educational disadvantage but to include a technical amendment which, due to the repeal of section 32 of the Education Act 1998, requires the definition to be reinstated in the 1998 Act.</p>]
[<p eid="para_82">I move amendment No. 4:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2012.1.dail.3.amd_4"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_83">In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_84">5.—Section 7 of the Act of 1998 is amended—</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_85">(<i>a</i>) by substituting the following paragraph for paragraph (a) of subsection (4):</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_86">"(<i>a</i>) shall have regard to—</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_87">(i) the resources available,</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_88">(ii) the need to secure, as far as possible, that the education</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_89">system provides—</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_90">(I) best practice in teaching methods,</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_91">(II) value for money, and</p>, <p class="indent_4" eid="para_92">(III) quality outcomes for students, by setting standards for those engaged in the provision of education, including the determination both of procedures and such other matters as are provided for by this Act,</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_93">(iii) the provision for education and training made by other agencies with funds provided by the Oireachtas,</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_94">(iv) the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State, and</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_95">(v) the practices and traditions relating to the organisation of schools or groups of schools existing at the commencement of this Part and the right of schools to manage their own affairs in accordance with this Act and any charters, deeds, articles of management or other such instruments relating to their establishment or operation, and",</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_96">and</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_97">(<i>b</i>) by repealing subsections (5) and (6) (inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004).”.</p>, <p eid="para_98">This is largely technical.  In the course of the legislative process, the Office of the Attorney General raised a question as to what guidance the Minister has when making procedures for the appointment, suspension and dismissal of school staff under section 24 of the Education Act.  There was a concern the sorts of considerations the Minister should have regard to in determining these and other procedures were not spelled out adequately in the Education Act.  The office has advised there is a need to set out the principles and policies the Minister must take into account in determining procedures such as these under the Act.  Amendment No. 4 will do this.  Section 7 of the Education Act 1998 provides for the functions of the Minister for Education and Skills, and subsection (4) provides for the considerations the Minister must have regard to in carrying out his functions.  The amendment being proposed adds a provision to that subsection requiring that in determining procedures, the Minister will have regard to best practice in teaching methods, value for money and quality outcomes for students.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">It is a checks and balances measure designed to ensure the Minister does not have a completely free hand in decisions.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">With respect, is the Deputy's question related to this amendment or is she speaking in the wider context?</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">For the purposes of the argument that I anticipate the Deputy will put forward on the issue of consultation, I think it may arise later in the debate.</p>]
[<p eid="para_108">I move amendment No. 5:<entity name="amendment" refersto="#bill.2012.1.dail.3.amd_5"></entity>
</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_109">In page 5, to delete lines 4 to 10 and substitute the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_110">"(<i>c</i>) be responsible, together with the board, parents of students and the teachers, for the creation in the school of an environment which is supportive of learning among the students and which promotes the professional development of the teachers,”.</p>, <p eid="para_111">The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to remove a comma from after the word "school" in the third line and to insert it after the word "responsible" in the first line.  This is to improve the readability of the provision and there is no substantive change to the provision.  This is a straightforward amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_120">We are dealing with amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 13 together.  The effect of the amendments will be to introduce a general requirement that the Minister must agree with the education partners any change in the numbers, qualifications, and terms and conditions of employment of teachers and other school staff.  It also continues the requirement to reach agreement with all parties on appointment, suspension and dismissal procedures.  These matters were discussed at length in the Seanad.</p>, <p eid="para_121">Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 introduce a requirement to consult and agree numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of employment generally of school staff.  This would set aside the existing provision, whereby the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform determine the terms and conditions of employment.  I am not accepting these amendments as they would diminish the existing powers in legislation given to the Ministers, and by extension the Government, regarding numbers, qualifications and terms and conditions of teachers and other staff remunerated from public funds.</p>, <p eid="para_122">In respect of amendment No. 13, the existing legal provision concerns three aspects of the terms and conditions of teachers and other staff, namely, appointment, suspension and dismissal.  The provision is limited to the procedures that apply or are to be carried out in respect of the three aspects.  The new provision ensures legal clarity in carrying out recruitment, suspension or dismissal as the procedures that apply in future will not be subject to a potential veto by one party withholding agreement.  I am not accepting amendment No. 13 because it would maintain such a veto.  I understand the concerns about substituting the word "consultation" for "agreement".  These fears can be allayed outside the statutory provisions by using the existing well developed partnership structures.  During the recent passage of the Bill through the Seanad my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruarí Quinn, set out the context for and the background to the provisions of the Bill.  There was clear affirmation of ongoing partnership within the school system.  He reminded the other House "that "agreement" does not mean unanimity or veto and "consultation" does not mean diktat or imposition."  He assured Senators that "following enactment of this Bill, my officials will engage in discussions with the education partners on having a general consensus around the extent and quality of this consultation and on how agreements are reached."  He has also given a commitment to "utilising established procedures, such as the Teachers Conciliation Council, as a vehicle for these discussions."  He has clarified that the Department of Education and Skills "will also engage directly with patron bodies which are not members of the council."</p>]
[<p eid="para_127">I do not.</p>]
[<p eid="para_129">The board of the school will remain as the employer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_131">Is the Deputy suggesting there will be a change in the <i>status quo</i> as a result of this Bill?</p>]
[<p eid="para_133">As a former principal, the Deputy will be aware that disciplinary procedures have been in place since 2009.  That should answer her question.</p>]
[<p eid="para_139">No, it will not.</p>]
[<p eid="para_162">This matter was raised in the Seanad.  The provisions of the Bill, combined with section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, prohibit the payment of a person employed as a teacher in a school unless he or she is a registered teacher.  The only exception is where, due to urgent, temporary or occasional staffing needs, it is necessary to employ an unregistered person.  Therefore, the pay of a teacher is stopped if his or her registration lapses.</p>, <p eid="para_163">The Bill does not provide for a direction to dismiss a teacher who is not registered.  Protection for schools against an unfair dismissals claim along the lines being advocated by this amendment would be arbitrary and disproportionate.  It would mean that a person whose registration lapses for even one day could be dismissed summarily and without recourse to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The circumstances which may arise may be as varied as a teacher allowing his or her registration to lapse for a small number of days due to a circumstance where an individual does nothing about getting registered.  Where a person is unregistered for a small number of days but then becomes re-registered, he or she should be able to return to his or her job.  Where there is a longer period during which the unregistered person is prevented from being paid by the State, he or she may wish to avail of unpaid leave, such as a career break, to gain the necessary qualifications to become registered with the Teaching Council.  Under these circumstances, no termination of the employment of the unregistered person takes place.  He or she simply cannot be paid from Oireachtas funds while he or she remains unregistered.  If a teacher allows his or her registration to lapse and absents himself or herself from school without approval, established grievance and disciplinary procedures may be followed to resolve the matter.  Even in this scenario a person should still expect to have the normal law protections, including access to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for an unfair dismissals claim.</p>, <p eid="para_164">Interposing the Minister in the employment contract by essentially permitting the immediate dismissal with impunity of a teacher who has allowed his or her registration to lapse runs counter to the concept of equal treatment and fair procedures.  A one-size-fits-all approach would be unjust.  Giving employers a licence to dismiss teachers without scrutiny must constitute an indiscriminate attack on their employment rights.  For these reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_168">To respond first to Deputy Smith's point on further education, section 30 only applies to teachers in recognised schools and does not apply to teachers in further education settings that are not, if one will, recognised schools.  I hope that addresses his point.</p>, <p eid="para_169">On Deputy Crowe's point, while we can examine some of the scenarios that could arise, to be honest there is no ambiguity about the manner in which we have responded to the amendment tabled by Deputy Smith.  As I stated, interposing the Minister in the employment contract by essentially permitting the immediate dismissal with impunity of a teacher who has let his or her registration lapse would run counter to the concept of equal treatment.  The Government is cognisant of the rights of employees and I hope Deputy Crowe and his party will give due regard to this issue, as they are doing to a certain extent.  While I do not see how the scenario the Deputy described could arise, if he foresees certain other scenarios arising, perhaps he will notify them to the Department and we will respond accordingly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_171">While I do not wish to open a discussion on this matter, if someone is dismissed, he or she is potentially dismissed with good reason, having gone through all the machinery or architecture of the State.  I am still a little unclear as to what exactly the Deputy has in mind in this regard.  I understand his position in terms of ensuring the legislation is watertight, and the bona fides of his point are secure in that sense.  If there are specific scenarios-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_176">Section 8 provides for a minor change to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to cross-reference the amendment of section 24 of the Education Act 1998 provided for in section 6.  Section 30 of the 2001 Act has not yet been commenced.  I plan to proceed with section 8 as outlined earlier.  There is no question of abolition of the Teaching Council and, therefore, this section should stand.</p>]
