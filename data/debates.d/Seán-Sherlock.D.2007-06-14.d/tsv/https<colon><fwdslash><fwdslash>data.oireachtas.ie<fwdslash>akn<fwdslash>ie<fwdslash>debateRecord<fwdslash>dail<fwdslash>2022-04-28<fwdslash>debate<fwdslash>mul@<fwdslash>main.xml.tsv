SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-04-28T09:10:00+01:00	Does the Minister for Finance intend to introduce a windfall tax on the extraordinary profits of energy companies to fund measures to combat the rising cost of energy for households and enterprises? Earlier this month the Minister indicated that he was finally, as it was put, evaluating the potential of slapping energy suppliers with windfall tax bills. I want to know if that will come to fruition.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-04-28T09:10:00+01:00	I welcome the fact the Government has finally come around at least to evaluating, to use the Minister's word, a windfall tax on extraordinary profits. This is a proposal the Government voted against in January when the Labour Party included it as part of our cost-of-living motion. We know energy companies like the ESB, which are not immediately tied into rising prices, made €679 million in profits last year, as thousands of homeowners struggled to pay soaring energy bills. Next week, ESB's Electric Ireland will go ahead with a near 25% increase in electricity and gas prices. We know that a conservative estimate, based on 2020 figures, suggests this could raise to the tune of €60 million to help pay for cost-of-living supports for households. Will the Minister of State give us a clearer indication as to the timelines for the completion of the evaluation?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-04-28T09:20:00+01:00	That will not cut the mustard with the businesses and households I deal with in my constituency. The Spanish Government was able to do this. It introduced a windfall tax on energy companies last September, therefore, there is a precedent set in the European Union on this. I want to give some solace to the small businesses and householders in my constituency. The Spanish case is a clear example of how funds generated through the windfall tax are paying for the country's VAT energy tax cut introduced in the same month last year. There is proof of concept and this tax is working in another EU member state. I ask that greater urgency be given to this concept, thereby bringing to fruition a windfall tax on profits.
