[<p eid="para_1555">I support the amendment.  The Minister of State spoke of the Aarhus Convention.  To my mind, that is a minimal set of standards.

It also speaks to the issues raised by Deputy Ferris whereby if it is a reserved function, one is guaranteed it will be wholly democratic and wholly representative.</p>]
