[<p eid="para_279">The programme for Government contains a commitment that the Government within thefirst 100 days of taking office, will provide a jobs initiative.  This initiative will contain apackage of measures to support employment creation and stimulate economic growth, while enhancing the activation supports available for those seeking employment.  It will deliver a minimum of an additional 15,000 places in training, work experience and educationalopportunities for those who are out of work as committed to in the programme for Government.</p>, <p eid="para_280">Details of these additional activation places will be contained in the forthcoming jobs initiative launch, which is due next week.  The activation places outlined in the initiative will be in addition to 108,500 training places, 168,000 places in the further education sector and 156,000 places in the higher education sector, which the unemployed may access.</p>]
[<p eid="para_282">Yes.  I nearly referred to the Deputy as Minister as I marked him in a former mandate.  In terms of the issues raised <i>vis-à-vis</i> graduates, there will be a clear priority within the upcoming jobs initiative towards adopting a qualitative approach to internships.  The intention is to take a more holistic view of the workplace programmes which it could be argued were not necessarily providing for the progression required in allowing students to progress from graduate status into the workplace and move further within that stream.  There is a clear priority in terms of internships which are additional to the existing programmes.  It should also be noted that there are at least 276,564 training places provided for if one takes the FÁS programme, the Skillnets programme, the labour market activation programme, the PLC programmes and the VTOS programmes.  They are well encompassed and the 15,000 places are additional.  It is envisaged that there will be a particular emphasis on providing quality internships in order to stem the tide of emigration and ensure graduates will not just be educated to take up jobs in such places as Australia and other countries.  A qualitative approach will be taken to the placement of graduates.</p>]
[<p eid="para_284">I can give that assurance.  The point the Deputy made parallels my own thinking.  It is clear that what is required is a more holistic approach to how we view training.  It must be with a view to ensuring progression and an outcome in order that the person in training either stays within the organisation across a broad public or private sector sphere or that he or she moves on but that he or she will have gained a progressive experience.  I will bear in mind what the Deputy said.  As he will appreciate, at this juncture I cannot say what will be in the jobs initiative document, but there will be a clear emphasis on the points he made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_286">The programme for Government has been negotiated and mandated by the House.  The most prescient approach would be to await publication of the jobs initiative.</p>]
[<p eid="para_350">I am responding on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciaran Cannon.</p>, <p eid="para_351">The review group was established in January 2009.  The review was carried out as part of the 2009-11 round of value for money reviews approved by the previous Government and conducted in accordance with the criteria for such reviews set out in the Department of Finance's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative Guidance Manual.  The emphasis in such reviews is on the efficiency and effectiveness of the programmes under examination to assess value for money in their delivery.</p>, <p eid="para_352">The composition of value for money review committees can vary.  In this instance, membership of the steering committee was drawn from my Department and other relevant Departments and included an independent chairman, namely, Mr. Willie Soffe, former county manager of Fingal County Council, and two independent experts.</p>, <p eid="para_353">All external stakeholders, including school patrons and parent and teacher organisations, were given an opportunity to make their views on the school transport scheme known.  The process included a call for submissions on a range of specific issues which resulted in 85 submissions.  In addition, following an assessment of these submissions and in order to give stakeholders a further opportunity to present their views, a day-long consultative forum was organised in October 2009 by the steering committee with a combination of individual sessions and an open forum discussion with the chairperson and committee members.  In this way, it was considered by the steering committee that all stakeholders were afforded a further opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the review process.</p>, <p eid="para_354">I am taking it that the Deputy is referring to the issue of the cessation of the closed school rule, CSR, as it relates to primary school transport eligibility.  This change was announced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derived from a recommendation in the published value for money review of the scheme.  To put the matter in context, the review showed that the unit cost of primary school transport was €1,020 per child.  Furthermore, the four year national recovery plan requires savings of €4.5 million to be made through operational efficiencies and other savings measures in the school transport budget in 2011, rising to overall full-year savings of €17 million by 2014.  The aggregation of the measures being implemented arising from the value for money review will be an important element in achieving these savings.</p>, <p eid="para_355">It is important to stress there are a number of dimensions to the cessation of the closed school rule.  The first of these which will be implemented from September involves the uniform application of the distance criteria to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the closed school rule.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 km from the school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport.  In such cases, the children concerned may apply for concessionary transport.</p>, <p eid="para_356">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>, <p eid="para_357">The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012 to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the value for money review, indicate that the impact of this change will be limited as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are, in fact. attending their nearest school.  Therefore, the majority of these families will not be affected by this change.</p>, <p eid="para_358">Before implementing this second main change which is proposed for 2012, my Department has requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the on the ground impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  This analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current school transport usage patterns and I expect to have the information available to me this summer.  I will then have an opportunity to carefully examine the likely effect of this change well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</p>]
[<p eid="para_363">I concur absolutely with the points the Deputy is making on the basis that I have received representations from families who are fearful they will be split as a result of the implementation of this mechanism.  I am aware there is a further review taking place and that it will conclude at an unspecified date some time this summer.  It should take a deeper look at exactly how many will be affected.  I am also aware of the potential for certain parishes to be affected adversely, whereby an amalgamated school may, ironically, have reduced numbers in the future.  There is no question but that a number of issues arise from the implementation of the initiative.  However, I ask the Deputy to give us some time pending the outcome of the review which will result in a closer examination of the exact effect on families.  I hope it will give rise to a further set of public utterances by the Minister on how some of the issues could be tackled.</p>]
[<p eid="para_969">No additional posts were allocated for Traveller pupils under DEIS in each of the past three years because Traveller pupils in all schools, including those in the DEIS programme, were supported under the Resource Teacher for Travellers scheme, which, the Deputy will be aware was discontinued by the previous Government.</p>, <p eid="para_970">However, up to this year, Traveller pupils were not included in the valid enrolment for the purposes of implementing the more favourable Pupil Teacher Ratios in DEIS schools.  As I indicated in my response to his question of 24 March, Traveller pupils have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.  I can now advise the Deputy that 81 posts have been provided for this purpose.</p>]
