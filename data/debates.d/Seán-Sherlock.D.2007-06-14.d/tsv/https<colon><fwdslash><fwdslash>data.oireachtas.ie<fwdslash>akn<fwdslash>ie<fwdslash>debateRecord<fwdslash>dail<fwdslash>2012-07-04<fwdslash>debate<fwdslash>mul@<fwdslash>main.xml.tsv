SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on the Department's behalf and more than 82 million km are covered annually.  In the region of 113,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.The current system for determining eligibility for school transport at post-primary level has been in place for more than 40 years.  When the Government announced the introduction of free post-primary education in 1966, the country was divided for planning purposes into geographic districts, also referred to as catchment areas.  Each area had several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools.  Post-primary pupils are eligible for transport if they reside 4.8 km or more from their local post-primary education centre, that is, the centre serving the catchment area in which they live.  The definition of school transport catchment boundaries has been the cause of many submissions and representations to the Department over the years.  It is widely considered by many that the current catchment boundary areas do not reflect changed demographics.  Changes in the post-primary school transport scheme were announced in the 2011 budget.  This was passed in December 2010 under a different mandate.One of the changes to take effect from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year means that the use of the catchment area system as a means of determining eligibility will cease for all pupils newly entering a post-primary school.  From this date, school transport eligibility for all new pupils entering a post-primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest post-primary education centre, having regard to ethos and language.  This will applied equitably on a national basis.  In general, eligible pupils, who are currently availing of school transport and who meet the distance criterion of 4.8 km, will retain their eligibility for the duration of their post-primary education, provided there is no change in their current circumstances.  Pupils who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the scheme.  The general approach of the Department in respect of the planning of school infrastructure is to plan on the basis of attendance of pupils at their nearest primary schools and that those primary schools then feed into attendance at the nearest post-primary schools or the nearest post-primary centre generally.  The changes announced in post-primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result in a more efficient and cost-effective system.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	Deputy Smith takes an innovative view of how the Topical Issues debate should be utilised in respect of lobbying for the new school.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	That is a lateral and imaginative view.  I respectfully suggest that the Deputy should table a parliamentary question or discuss the issue with the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  It has been noted on the record of the House.  There may be individual vagaries relating to counties Tipperary and Cavan.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, has specific responsibility for this area.  He is not averse to hearing the individual views of the Deputies in respect of the vagaries of the system as they work out in the two constituencies.However, we must emphasise that, to allow parents ample time to consider the school options, a 20-month gap was allowed between the announcement of this measure and the time when parents needed to apply for school transport.  Children who wish to attend the same school as their older siblings but who are not eligible for school transport to the school may apply for transport to the school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  These changes were posted on the Department's website in October 2011 and the updated scheme was made available on 1 February 2012.  The Department contacted post-primary schools directly on two occasions in addition to the relevant education partners formally advising them of the changes.With regard to the impact of the changes, the Deputy may be aware that, as part of the value for money review, an examination was conducted of selections of school transport catchment boundaries which tested the application of an arrangement where the transport is available to the nearest post-primary centre.  This concluded that 82% of the pupils are attending their nearest post-primary school.In general, existing eligible children will retain their eligibility for the remainder of their post-primary education provided their circumstances do not change.  The revised eligibility criteria are confined to those families who have children newly entering post-primary school.  This change in eligibility is being applied equitably on a national basis and, in some cases, pupils in the same area or family may be eligible for transport to different schools during the transitional period of five years.  In these cases, transport and the concessionary basis may be an option.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I understand the issues involved concern the outcome of a tendering process for the running of a bar in Terminal 1 of Dublin Airport.  The Dublin Airport Authority has confirmed that the tender process for the outlets in question was conducted through the Official Journal of the European Union's system for public procurement and was fully compliant with all guidelines.  The tender documentation for the outlets in question stated that transfer of undertakings legislation may apply and advised potential tenderers to seek advice on such legislation.The restructuring currently under way at a number of outlets is a matter for the operators in question.  I am not privy to the details of transfer or the parties involved.  One cannot but have sympathy for those involved in this dispute.  Without fudging the issue and in seeking to give an honest answer to the Deputy, I must suggest firmly that industrial relations machinery needs to come into play on this issue.  I hope both sides will agree to a process in which such machinery can be utilised to come to a resolution that is satisfactory to both.I have to hand a very detailed response on the rights of employees in regard to transfers of undertakings but I do not believe it is necessary to read it out.  However, I strongly support the idea that labour relations machinery should be utilised in this instance.  I would be very surprised if there has not already been a move in that regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I agree with everything Deputy Lyons has said.  Let us be frank and honest about it.  The issue at hand here is one of corporate social responsibility, a term we bandy around from time to time and can use quite easily.  If there is a transfer of undertakings here, as Deputy Lyons stated, it says something about the morality of the company.  There is a strong sense here of an obligation on the part of SPP, where it has taken over a facility in what is, effectively, a State entity, to ensure the rights of the workers are vindicated or at least that there is a recognition of the experience of the existing staff who go into the new undertakings.In this instance, though we recognise that no law has been broken, there is a certain corporate social responsibility.  I hope that common sense will prevail and that the extensive machinery of the State in labour relations could be applied in this instance.It is important that these issues are raised on the floor of this House also.  It sends a signal back to these entities that these matters are being looked at by Government and that there is a consciousness in this House of the issues Deputy Lyons raises.
SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	In February, we debated the budget measures in regard to teacher staffing schedules for schools.  The debate over the past two evenings has been a rerun of that debate.  While Deputy Flanagan's Bill is well intended, it is fundamentally misconceived.  I do not say that in a disrespectful way.  The proposals the Deputy advances would keep schools open even if there were not enough pupils to sustain them.  Therefore, the Government will be opposing this Bill.The value-for-money review of small primary schools, currently being finalised in my Department, should be available after the summer recess.  The review is simply about evaluating all the facts to inform future policy in this area.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, will publish the review and bring it before this House so we can have a wide-ranging and properly informed debate on its outcomes and proposals.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We should bear in mind that one third of public sector employees in the State work in the education sector.  It is, therefore, not possible to exempt staffing in education completely from the Government's need to reduce expenditure.  This is particularly the case at a time when the school-going population is increasing.  There will be more difficult decisions in the next budget and the one thereafter.  The very favourable staffing provision for small schools was put in place when resources were plentiful, at a time of demographic dividend when enrolments were falling.The Government rejects the claims that are being made about closing small schools.  The Opposition had been predicting wholesale closures of schools in the debate in February.  Five schools have indicated their intention to close over the coming school year.  Last year, there were three closures, and the year before there were four.  All that is changing for small close schools is that, from next September, their average class size will no longer be as advantageous as it once was.  The schools will still exist.I have listened to some alarmist claims about the threat of school staffing schedule changes affecting the very fabric of rural areas.  When I hear Deputies from Dún Laoghaire and south Dublin, and the great burghers of Dún Laoghaire and the great middle classes, lecturing me and the Government on the plight of rural Ireland-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	-----I find it very hard to take.  There is nobody more in tune with the needs of rural Ireland than Deputies and Ministers such as me.  We represent the very people in question and are doing our best to defend, when we can, the rights of the schools concerned.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I will take no lectures from the likes of Deputy Boyd Barrett who, on every occasion, manipulates people in the Visitors Gallery for his cynical aims.  He is no more a socialist than the man in the moon.  He is a cynic and manipulates public discourse for his own ends.  He knows nothing about rural Ireland or its people.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I remember that episode.
