SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-10-20T12:40:00+01:00	Mr. Jonathan Tobin, from Youghal, County Cork, is currently in hospital in Greece. He had a catastrophic accident on 29 July last. His family now wants to bring him home. The HSE is liaising with his family, and both Cork University Hospital and the hospital in Greece are liaising with each other. We are now trying to get the HSE to use its discretion under the treatment abroad scheme to get an air ambulance to bring him home. I ask the Minister to please intercede with the HSE to bring the man home if possible.
