[<p eid="para_273">I have just received notification this very minute that a company, Positive Care, which provides residential services for young people, is to be put out of business with the loss of up to 240 jobs. The company provides residential services for vulnerable young people in up to 25 facilities, as I understand it. I appreciate that I am inquiring with the Taoiseach about this matter at very short notice, but I ask him to make himself aware of what is happening. It is very serious for the provision of services for young, vulnerable people, especially those who are in residential care. The loss of this service provider represents a massive blow to the capability of this country to provide for the most vulnerable of our young people.</p>]
