SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I will couch my questions with a reference to the role and remit of the committee in looking at the regulatory framework and, more generally, where the banking sector stands today.  We have seen the downgrading by Standard & Poor's and Moody's which speaks volumes about the current banking culture in the State.On contracts for difference, what is the internal audit unit's regulatory role, as the delegates understand it, in terms of their internal procedures?  What is the regulatory framework for reporting contracts for difference in Anglo Irish Bank's operations?  What involvement has the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator had with the bank in these transactions?  Was there an internal auditing procedure to govern them?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If, for instance, a number of shareholders were loaned money to buy shares using the shares as collateral, would Mr. Tyrell have a role in that regard?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	There is a loan issue and there is a shareholder issue.  I understand the distinction Mr. Tyrell makes in terms of his role vis-à-vis a shareholder issue.  If there were loans which were acquired by people who are shareholders for the purposes of purchasing stock or shares in Anglo Irish Bank, would Mr. Tyrell have a role?  If I ask this question I am doing so as a layman who seeks an understanding, on behalf of the people who are looking at Anglo Irish Bank and wondering what in God’s name is going on.  We are trying to get an understanding of how the financial regulatory system works in terms of banking operations and how risk management and internal auditing functions are carried out.  I would like that information dissected and disseminated in such a way as to give the ordinary man and woman in the street some degree of understanding of how these things work, mindful of the fact that this bank is nationalised.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If Mr. Tyrell is looking at the lending controls, is he mindful, in terms of his operations, as to what is happening within the market or is it merely an internal compliance risk management issue?  Is Mr. Tyrell mindful of the fact that if a person, who was a shareholder for the purposes of purchasing shares, was to seek a loan, the internal auditors in that instance have no role whatsoever in terms of the lending policy?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If the internal auditors have a role is it flagged up or does one call time on it?  What is the exact procedure by which internal auditors act in such instances if it were to happen?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Therefore, the final decision is not that of the internal auditor.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I thank Mr. Tyrell.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	If the process was working so well, why does Mr. Tyrell think we are where we are today in terms of Anglo Irish Bank?  Can he give an overview, given his 12 years experience with Anglo Irish Bank and the fact that he was appointed head of internal audit in 2005 and is the former head of Anglo Irish Assurance Company?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Will Mr. Tyrell please elaborate on that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In Deputy Kelly's world, Fianna Fáil was never in power during the last ten years.  That was just a dream also.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am seeking a better understanding of the submissions being made to the committee.  No human being with any sense of reason could believe that if a chairman of one of the banks in Ireland approached that bank for a loan, he or she would be subject to the same stringent internal audit procedures as, for example, me, if I sought a loan from Anglo Irish Bank.  The delegates cannot realistically expect us or the people to believe what has been said about the internal auditing procedures as they applied to the loans of various directors.I am trying to look at this from the perspective of an ordinary shareholder such as a pensioner who had ordinary shares in the bank as an investment and was hoping for a return on that investment in their autumn or winter years.  There appears to be a sense of duplicity in how internal auditing procedures were effected with regard to directors' loans and how they were effected in the case of other loans such as to business.  I spoke about the contracts for difference.  I am anxious to understand before I leave this committee whether there was a procedure whereby loans were made to individuals who were shareholders for the purpose of purchasing shares, where contracts for difference were transferred into ordinary shares, if I understand the process correctly.  I have not received a satisfactory answer to assist my understanding of how the internal auditing procedures operate in such instances.It has been stated publicly or in the press that there were a number of what I call "angel investors" who assisted shareholders for the purpose of buying what was reported to be a 10% shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is also stated some of those were existing shareholders.  We are trying to find out the extent of the borrowings, what was used as collateral for these borrowings and whether there was a reporting procedure to the Department of Finance.  The delegates have stated they cannot talk about individual shareholders; therefore, I will put my question in another way.  If somebody who is a shareholder purchases shares and takes out a loan from Anglo Irish Bank for the purpose of purchasing these shares, is there an internal auditing procedure in that regard and is there a reporting procedure that must be undertaken to the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate the position——
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is not exactly what I am stating.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	My point concerns whether people took out loans using a particular form of collateral, namely, shares in the bank, to purchase shares in the bank.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I appreciate that, but it goes to the heart of what the committee is examining for whatever input we have into a legislative framework to shore up some of these matters in the future.  It assists our understanding of how we might proceed in that regard.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	What would lending of this nature typically be given for?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am trying to increase my understanding of the internal audit process, the risk management function in respect of lending and the credit control function.  We are just trying to find out what the nature of the loans might be.
