SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the representatives of Teagasc.  When we think about Teagasc which has a presence in many communities, there is a sense of positivity about its multifaceted work in areas such as education, research and consultancy.  While I acknowledge that its educational role is increasing, I wonder if the courses mentioned in the presentation would be so popular if the boom in the construction industry was ongoing.I would like to go off on a tangent by discussing the potential of the agriculture sector for the economy of rural Ireland, with particular reference to research.  Will the representatives of Teagasc give us details of the cutting-edge research being conducted in the agriculture and rural economy sectors?  The agriculture sector has a major opportunity to diversify into the production of energy from sources such as methane.  I will not refer to it as alternative energy production because it is about to become mainstream.  I ask the delegates to outline what Teagasc is doing in this regard.It would not be a bad idea for members of the committee to visit some of the Teagasc sites where research is taking place to obtain more information on its research function.  People in my local area are very proud of the work that takes place at the Moorepark research centre in the heart of my constituency.  While it may be a cliché to refer to it as the jewel in the crown of the east Cork region, we are proud of the centre and the research done there.  Without being too parochial, what does the future hold for centres such as Moorepark and local offices like the one in Mallow?  I understand the provision made for Teagasc in the 2009 budget represents a decrease of approximately 8%.  What impact will the decrease, from €132 million to €122 million, have on the delivery of services?  Will the delegates give us some feedback?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	On a point of order, I understand what Professor Boyle is saying about awareness and sustainability, but we would take that as a given.  I am specifically asking about research projects on methane and the greening of agriculture.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	In regard to the research function, I understand Professor Boyle's point about the return.  In terms of scientific proposals that are made, I understand Teagasc tenders for external research and that the Department has a tendering process in this regard.  In terms of the internal research function, the proposals made and the internal returns, as a lay man I wonder how many proposals will come forward to Teagasc on an annual basis, internally, and how many Teagasc makes returns on in terms of viability economically or in respect of a contribution to other components in the scientific community.From a geopolitical perspective, methane is coming on the agenda and there will be a global move to reduce herd numbers.  The basis of that will be the production of methane.  The scientific community must come up with something or the alternative will be to reduce herd numbers.  I am not proposing that we reduce herd numbers but I wonder where the scientific community is in respect or this.  The delegation stated that research is taking place in Oak Park, though I thought it was at Grange.  I am trying to ascertain whether we are ahead of, on or behind the curve in terms of where science is.Is there an appetite for take-up of the voluntary retirement scheme or has it been finalised?Regarding operating expenses, I note expenditure of €2.4 million for postage and telephones in 2007.  Fuel and petrol amounts to €2.1 million.  I understand Teagasc has 1,400 employees and it is an expensive spend.  How does Teagasc gain efficiency in respect of the service providers for telephones?  Does it tender on an annual basis?  Is it practical to do so?  Can the delegation give us an idea of how Teagasc operates from that perspective?
