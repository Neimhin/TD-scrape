I am not sure how much practical effect it will have. Mutual recognition of decisions concerning supervision measures as an alternative to provisional detention means, in layperson's language, mutual recognition of bail. An Irish resident charged with an offence in another member state can be given bail and have his or her bail conditions monitored here, as opposed to being remanded in custody abroad. Similarly, a resident of another member state charged with an offence here may be granted bail on condition that his or her bail is monitored in his or her home member state. We are talking about cases where the accused resides abroad and is given bail allowing him or her to return home on the expectation that he or she will return to Ireland for trial. I do not know how often that will happen in practice, but it is welcome, for what it is worth.
