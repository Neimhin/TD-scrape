[<p eid="para_34">I welcome Ms Gilleece and Mr. Molan to the committee.  It is unfortunate that the Cabinet reshuffle is taking precedence today.</p>, <p eid="para_35">I welcome the presentation which is direct and unequivocal.  The language is not coded in any way and clearly sets out the intentions and aspirations of CUMA.  That is what we need to hear in the committee.  A number of disparate views have been expressed on the application of section 35 and on the regulatory regime.  There is a clear divide between the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, and the ILCU with regard to the regulatory framework.  Has CUMA a criticism to make with regard to the ILCU proposals to have the regulatory framework housed under a Department?  If I remember correctly, the ILCU attested that the regulatory framework for credit unions should be outside of the Central Bank commission.  The only route to take is under the umbrella of the Central Bank commission, but how that is finessed is a matter for discussion.  I take the same view as CUMA with regard to a direct reporting system to the head of financial regulation rather than to a sub-head or assistant director.  If we are to recognise the importance of the credit union and the primacy of its role within society, it must be given due recognition with regard to the reporting role.  That is common sense.  What is the CUMA position with regard to the ILCU position?</p>, <p eid="para_36">I am amazed that CUMA is not part of the working group on section 35, as I was given to understand that all of the stakeholders would be actively involved in the process.  Bearing that in mind and based on what CUMA has said about the section 35 working group and the indebtedness working group, the committee should take a strong stance with regard to CUMA membership of both of those working groups.  If we are to achieve anything from this meeting, the committee should request the Minister, or demand of him if that is within our remit, to involve CUMA in those two working groups.  This makes sense.  CUMA is made up of credit union managers and it would be remiss not to involve it as part of the working group.</p>, <p eid="para_37">Section 35 is the big issue.  CUMA has set out clearly the permutations for the ordinary credit union member.  While CUMA is not part of the section 35 working group, it appears from its submission that it has an insight into the proposals.  What is the optimum solution with regard to section 35?  CUMA has outlined its critique of the section, in terms of the 20% of the loan book over five years provision and whether this is effective in terms of the liquidity scenario for a given credit union.  What direction should the Minister take on section 35?  If CUMA was to write or amend the legislation or the particular section, how would it do that?  CUMA's submission makes sense.  We need common sense in terms of the approach the regulatory framework should take and in terms of section 35.  CUMA is speaking my language on this matter.  However, if I am to push a position along the lines of an unequivocal analysis of section 35 with regard to what CUMA would like to see occur, it would be very helpful to me and members of the committee to have CUMA's views on what should be done.</p>]
[<p eid="para_41">Ms Gilleece mentioned the withdrawal of banking services.  Does CUMA aspire to filling a gap and expanding its services even further?  The ordinary layman is concerned that credit unions will become de facto banks and, therefore, lose some of their ethos.  I do not have particular concerns about that, but it is something that may be said.  If that is its aspiration, how far does CUMA want to take it?  At what point might it stop being an organisation with a duty of care?  It was stated that every financial institution has a duty of care to its stakeholders, depositors or whatever, but that is not always the case in reality.  I would like to understand the aspiration and whether we are talking about a potential reshaping of the credit union movement or whether the original ethos will be protected.  Is there a danger the ethos could falter?  I would like to understand and get some sense of CUMA's aspiration.</p>]
