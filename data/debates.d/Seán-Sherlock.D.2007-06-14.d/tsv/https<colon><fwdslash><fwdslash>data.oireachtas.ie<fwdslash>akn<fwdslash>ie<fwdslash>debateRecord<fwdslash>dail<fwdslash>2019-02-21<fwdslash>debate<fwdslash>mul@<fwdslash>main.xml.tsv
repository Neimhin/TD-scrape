[<p eid="para_354">I move:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_355">That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, leave be given to withdraw the Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016.</p>, <p eid="para_356"> I seek leave to withdraw my Prohibition of Micro-Plastics Bill 2016 on the basis that I gave a commitment that, if the Government published legislation or moved on the area of banning microplastics and microbeads, I would yield to it.</p>, <p eid="para_357">We have, to be fair to the Government, a general scheme of the Prohibition of Certain Products Containing Plastic Microbeads Bill 2018. I am quite happy to withdraw my Bill. I do so in good faith on the basis that in 2016 the TÃ¡naiste gave a commitment that this would be legislated for. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has published the general scheme of the Bill and I trust that the Government will now proceed in a timely fashion with the publication of the legislation and see it through to its logical conclusion and ban microplastics and microbeads from this jurisdiction for now and for all time.</p>]
