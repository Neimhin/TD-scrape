[<p eid="para_80">I am in Leinster House, the 1932 annexe. I thank the Minister of State for being present. I also thank her for the very professional manner in which she deals with queries from my constituency office on individual cases. I record my gratitude to her for her engagement with me on behalf of my constituents and people in the Cork region who live outside my constituency.</p>, <p eid="para_81"> I will start with the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party last week. I questioned the Minister of State about the figures during the debate. I had tabled a parliamentary question for answer on 8 April which showed that the total number of overdue applications for an assessment of need, AON, was running at 5,078, give or take. I need some reconciliation of the figures given what the Minister of State is telling us today. There was a slight discrepancy between what was in the script we received and the script the Minister of State delivered. She stated she was pleased to inform the committee that by the end of April we had reduced the waiting list to approximately 1,500 cases. The information I received was 5,078 versus 1,500 cases. That is the first point. Could the Minister of State give us a perspective on that? Perhaps in accountancy terms, a reconciliation statement needs to be done and that might require me tabling a further parliamentary question or perhaps the Minister of State could write to the committee.</p>]
[<p eid="para_83">I would be very grateful if the Minister of State, her Department or the HSE could communicate with the Department to correct the information or inform the committee because we rely heavily on these figures. I take her point and thank her for her clarification.</p>, <p eid="para_84"> I will run through my questions very quickly as I am conscious of time. The interim review of the SOP is due to take place. Is there a set of terms and conditions or terms of reference for the SOP and will that include taking testimonials from parents? Following on from the point made by Deputy Cairns, it would be vitally important that parents would be part of that process. If this issue is a matter for jurisprudence at the moment, that would certainly worry me. As a member of the committee I would have to be confident that this is not going to be just a box-ticking exercise. I am concerned about the possibility that it is going to vindicate the existing SOP and then we are out the gap in 2022 with the boxes ticked and we must do retrospective work on what could potentially be flawed AONs. I am genuinely worried that we would have a problem down the line.</p>]
[<p eid="para_86">I thank the Minister of State. I do not know how much time I have left.</p>]
[<p eid="para_88">I will ask a question. Again, it is about a response to a parliamentary question on 30 April where I asked about additional staff recruitment in CHO 4 since 2018. The reference number of the question was 20364/21. I was informed that there was one whole-time equivalent speech and language therapist for the Cope Foundation, one speech and language therapist for north Cork in St. Josephâ€™s Foundation, one occupational therapist for the South Lee Brothers of Charity, one occupational therapist for the Cope Foundation in north Lee, one occupational therapist for north Cork in St. Joseph's Foundation and one speech and language therapist in south Lee. I do not expect the Minister of State to internalise all of that, but I have given her the reference number of the parliamentary question and her staff will probably have regard to that. The point is that there has only been one of each type of therapist in each of the sectors in north Lee, north Cork, south Lee, north Cork, north Cork and south Lee. I refer to speech and language therapists and occupational therapists. It is never going to be enough to meet demand. Those are dismal figures in terms of the follow-on from the AONs and the need for access to the services. It is very hard to see how the Minister of State will be able to provide services to support people in each of those areas unless there is a serious effort in respect of recruitment. I put that information before the Minister of State.</p>]
