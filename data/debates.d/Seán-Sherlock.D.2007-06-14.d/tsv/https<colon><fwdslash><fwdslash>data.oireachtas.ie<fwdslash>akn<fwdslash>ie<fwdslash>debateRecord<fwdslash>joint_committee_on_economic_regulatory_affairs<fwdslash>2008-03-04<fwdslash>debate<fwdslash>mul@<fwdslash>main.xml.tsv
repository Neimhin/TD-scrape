SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the taxi regulator and her colleague.  Most of the points I wished to make have been covered.  There has been a tangible improvement in the level of service, particularly in larger urban areas such as Cork city and Dublin.  It is easier to get a taxi, day or night, than it was heretofore.  The regulator has been instrumental in bringing that about.I come from Mallow, north Cork and licences there used to be issued by the local authority, which gave an element of control.  Now, we see the local authority no longer has that power, which is vested in the regulator, and there is no interaction between the local authority and the regulator in terms of provision of spaces.  In Mallow, which is typical of many towns, more and more licences are being issued but the main street or the taxi ranks cannot cope.  Has there been consultation?  The regulator's submission refers to consultation with the local authorities but has there been consultation specifically with regard to the provision of taxi spaces?  There are currently 47 taxi licences in Mallow and the town does not have the space to cope with these.I differ from my colleague from the Green Party regarding the nine-year vehicle standard rule.  The German case is different in that there is a German brand, the Mercedes-Benz, in which there is national pride.  It is much easier to impose a certain type of car or colour in that scenario.I would argue that as long as a vehicle is up to certain standards in respect of cleanliness and its operation, I do not see why it cannot be used as a public service vehicle.  I differ in this regard.  Given that it is his or her business, a taxi driver who has the wherewithal to invest moneys in a licence should have a certain degree of autonomy as to the vehicle that he or she could choose to use.I seek clarification as to whether it is envisaged that a standard would be imposed whereby any vehicle that was more than nine years old could not be used.  While I may be wrong in this regard, I would be vehemently opposed to such a proposal.  Many vehicles, such as the aforementioned famous German marque, will go on for ten, 15 or 20 years and can be operated as effectively as any two or three year old car as long as they receive proper maintenance.  At present, people operate with older marques, many of which are more than ten years old, which are in perfectly good condition and I do not see why such vehicles cannot continue to be used.While those are the basic points, I also seek clarification on the ownership of taxi licences.  My understanding is that plates will no longer be transferable.  If that assumption is correct, will it be the case that if someone invests in a taxi business, this plate, which costs approximately €6,000, will be non-transferable and cannot be used as an asset should the person in question decide to dispose of it to a family member or otherwise?  Were this to be the case, I would have an issue with it.  Someone who builds up a business and invests approximately €6,000, should be able to transfer that licence as he or she sees fit, subject to certain provisions being put in place.  It should be subject to certain rules and regulations and the person taking over the licence should adhere to certain regulations and training.  If the plates are non-transferable, perhaps the regulator will clarify the reason and expand on this subject.  I thank the regulator for her submission.

SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I asked about uniformity but I think Ms Doyle addressed my question.  She does not propose uniformity of vehicle make or colour.
