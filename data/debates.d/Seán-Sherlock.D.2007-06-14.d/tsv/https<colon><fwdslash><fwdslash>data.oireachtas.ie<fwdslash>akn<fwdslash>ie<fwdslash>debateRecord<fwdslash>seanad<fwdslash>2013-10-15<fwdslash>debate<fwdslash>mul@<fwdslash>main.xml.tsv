[<p eid="para_446">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who has been unavoidably detained.</p>, <p eid="para_447"> The availability of dedicated urological input is particularly relevant for children with spina bifida, a highly complex physical disability. On average, 30 children are born each year in Ireland with open spina bifida, the most severe form of the condition. Best practice is that there are multiple professionals involved on a spina bifida team. Early intervention by a specialist and local team is essential to optimise long-term functioning of the children in question and prevent medical complications later in life.</p>, <p eid="para_448"> The Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, is the national tertiary care centre for spina bifida. All infants born in Ireland with spina bifida are transferred to Temple Street after birth for ongoing neonatal management. Children with spina bifida are seen by a multidisciplinary team at Temple Street which includes a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in spina bifida, a spina bifida nurse specialist and neurosurgery input.</p>, <p eid="para_449"> The model of care being developed by the Health Service Executive is to share care between the specialist team in Temple Street and the local team. The best care should be provided nearest to the patient's home, with guidance and support from the specialist team. However, it is acknowledged that many complex issues are best managed by the specialist team.</p>, <p eid="para_450"> The multidisciplinary spina bifida clinic was established in Temple Street in February 2011. However, there has not been any dedicated urological input to date. A recruitment process was under way in 2009-2010, from which the hospital hoped to recruit a consultant urologist. Unfortunately, the recruitment process did not produce a suitable candidate for the post and a further recruitment process in 2012-2013 was not successful either. However, a new recruitment process is in train. The post is with the national recruitment service, to be advertised by the Public Appointments Service. The HSE is hopeful this new recruitment process will succeed in hiring a suitable candidate.</p>, <p eid="para_451"> While awaiting the appointment of a consultant urologist, spina bifida patients are being reviewed by a consultant surgeon who has been granted honorary status at the hospital. The hospital has also been in negotiations to establish a regular clinic with a UK paediatric urologist. This is complete and dates have been scheduled for 17 and 18 October and in December for visits from the UK paediatric urologist. An appropriate service level agreement is in place.</p>, <p eid="para_452"> Consultants at the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, have identified patients requiring this support. As an interim arrangement, children requiring urgent urological input are prioritised clinically and seen in the United Kingdom under the treatment abroad scheme. All patients are being kept under regular review and referred to the UK on a case by case basis for treatment, pending the appointment of a permanent urologist.</p>, <p eid="para_453"> The Government is acutely aware of the challenges that patients with spina bifida and urological conditions generally and their families face in managing their care. The Department is committed to providing the best possible health service and will continue to work with the HSE to ensure the best possible outcomes for spina bifida patients.</p>]

[<p eid="para_460">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Alan Shatter, is unable to be here and has asked me to convey his thanks to the Senator for raising the matter. As the Senator may be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service. The 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which, of course, include the provision, maintenance and management of court buildings. Decisions about court venues are entirely a matter for the Courts Service board and the Minister has no role in the decision.</p>, <p eid="para_461"> In the current financial climate, the service has been obliged to review all aspects of its organisational and operational structures throughout the country with the specific objective of ensuring that it can continue to maintain the delivery of front-line court services and an appropriate level of service to court users. The Minister has been informed that no court venue has been singled out or indeed exempted from the review process.</p>, <p eid="para_462"> A comprehensive review of all venues throughout the country has recently been completed, the purpose of which was to establish a general framework within which venues could be considered for closure taking into account a range of criteria such as case load, proximity to an alternative venue, physical condition of the building, availability of holding cell facilities, etc. The likely impact on other justice agencies, such as An Garda Síochána and the Irish Prison Service, was also taken into account. The Minister is informed that the review identified a range of venues nationwide, which, based on the criteria applied, could be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case in respect of each identified venue.</p>, <p eid="para_463"> Since its establishment in 1999, the Courts Service has amalgamated nearly 160 venues, while, at the same time, the service has benefited from a very substantial capital investment to upgrade court accommodation around the country. The policy has been very successful, resulting in a more efficient use of time for the Judiciary, court users and gardaí. Rather than short sittings in the smaller venues, a full day's list can be dealt with which leads to reductions in delays in the District Court.</p>, <p eid="para_464"> The Senator has inquired, in particular, about courthouses in County Kerry. The Courts Service has informed me that Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Dingle have been identified as venues to be considered for closure subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case as mentioned earlier. Standard courthouse requirements include basic facilities such as consultation rooms, victim support facilities and holding cells for prisoners which are essential to ensure public safety and efficient use of Irish Prison Service resources.</p>, <p eid="para_465"> The Senator should note that the service has advised that the identification of venues as part of the review process does not necessarily mean that the identified venues will close, as each identified venue will be subject to a rigorous examination. The Courts Service board will take no decision on the future of Kenmare, Cahersiveen, Killorglin and Dingle as District Court venues without full prior consultation with local interested parties and court users. The Minister has been advised that the consultation on the identified venues is under way. Submissions were sought from a range of local interests and the closing date for receipt of submissions was 25 September 2013. The Courts Service has indicated that it has met local interested parties and the service has assured the Minister that the views expressed in the consultation process will be taken into account in the decision-making process. As I mentioned, the final decision on the closure of any venue is a matter for the board of the Courts Service.</p>, <p eid="para_466"> I thank the Senator for raising the matter and appreciate his interest in the administration of justice in County Kerry. I know the Senator will understand the need for the Courts Service to take the necessary measures to promote greater efficiency in the courts and hope the constructive engagement involving the Courts Service will result in reasoned and appropriate decisions being made on the venues concerned.</p>]
[<p eid="para_473">I acknowledge the statement of the Senator. If we are to make statements in public fora such as this, we should try to extrapolate a little more from the data. The data go back to 2006 and suggest some 3,000 houses do not have access to a motor vehicle. We can extrapolate from them the number of people who will present before the justice system and it would be fair to say the figure would be minuscule, but if they did have to present at a venue which was a little further away, to reiterate an earlier point I made, I imagine their access to justice would not be prevented in any way. I imagine the neighbourly people of County Kerry would facilitate them in any way they could.</p>, <p eid="para_474"> As I have stated, the Courts Service operates independently and makes independent decisions. There is no doubt that the Courts Service has identified venues which should be considered, as the Senator has outlined, but subject to a detailed assessment and the preparation of a business case. The response I am giving from the Minister for Justice and Equality is clear in that sense.</p>]
