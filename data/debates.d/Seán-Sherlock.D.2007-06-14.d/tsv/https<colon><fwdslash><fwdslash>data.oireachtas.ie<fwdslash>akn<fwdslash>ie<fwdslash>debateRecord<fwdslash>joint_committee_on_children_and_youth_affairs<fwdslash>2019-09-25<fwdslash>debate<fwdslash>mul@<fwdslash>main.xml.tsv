SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:30:00+01:00	I thank the representatives for coming before the committee. I do not doubt but that they seek to make a genuine effort to tackle these sensitive issues. A common theme which is emerging here is that of resources. I acknowledge the role played by the former Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in seeking to progress matters, particularly in mental health, and the challenges she faced in trying to get a greater slice of the health budget assigned to mental health. I understand the constraints. I will speak specifically on Cork. How many inpatient beds are there in Cork at present?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:30:00+01:00	That will be the operational number. How many are there now?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:30:00+01:00	Are they at capacity every night of the week?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:30:00+01:00	I know.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:30:00+01:00	My motivation in asking is, whether or not there is full occupancy, in an effort to understand the culture that exists within the acute inpatient facilities.I am trying to have some degree of knowledge about the decision-making process whereby a person finds himself or herself in one of the these units. Due to the culture or decision making process, there are situations from time to time when some of those beds are left vacant for prolonged periods when there is clear evidence of a demand for them. I do not have sight of that and Mr. Ryan might not be able to give an answer on it today, but I would be happy to revisit it with him and the HSE at a future meeting. If there is such a demand for services and if it is the case that there are empty beds, there is a disparity that must be addressed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	I do not wish to extrapolate too much from what Dr. Doody said or to put words in his mouth, but he referred to Linn Dara versus the Cork facility, Eist Linn. Eist Linn is a refurbished facility.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	Would that come up to the mark as a fit-for-purpose or appropriate setting post-refurbishment for the type of structures he just spoke about?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	My time is brief and I will refer back to Dr. Doody on the Cork facility at a future date as there are further questions to be asked about it to shed light on, and understand better, the dynamics that inform the running of the facility. There have been legitimate questions in the past about the culture that exists there. There are 130 individuals waiting more than 18 months for CAMHS assessments in my neck of the woods. If I am reading information relating to interventions correctly, and without putting words in anybody's mouth, the term "resources" is the key. It is preventing children and families in my area from receiving proper assessments. I understand there is a multidisciplinary team and that there are constraints with regard to recruitment and so forth. Has the HSE examined the multidisciplinary team model with regard to reducing the numbers on the waiting lists in such a way as to redeploy resources from other areas or through outside recruitment on short-term contracts or by ensuring that with proper supervision it might not necessarily have to be a psychiatrist who would make the initial assessment and it could be somebody else under the supervision of a psychiatrist? The bottom line is that the families I know must be able to get assessments. If we are talking about staving off problems down the line, as Deputy Lisa Chambers mentioned, intervention at the earliest stage is required. That is self-evident, and I am not a physician. It can prevent many problems down the line. Are more imaginative solutions being considered at present to ensure we can get the waiting list down in spite of the capacity and resource constraints?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	I apologise for cutting across Mr. Ryan but Dr. Doody is saying that 50% are seen within four weeks. I have 130 families waiting 18 months. That is based on a reply to a parliamentary question, which was Mr. Ryan's reply.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	There is a big gap there.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:40:00+01:00	What is best international practice vis-Ã -vis the multidisciplinary teams? Is it a flat structure or is it a hierarchical structure whereby the psychiatrist is the head honcho, as it were? Is that best international practice or does it differ in other countries?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-09-25T11:50:00+01:00	I will follow up with Mr. Ryan. We might have a meeting in Cork in respect of services there.
