[<p eid="para_658">I propose to make a few points and to ask a few questions. If the Minister can answer them in the time allocated, I would be grateful. If not, I would be happy to receive a written reply.</p>, <p eid="para_659">I wish to raise four issues: the status of undocumented workers, the enforcement of regulations by An Garda Síochána, direct provision and the status of the Garda task force.</p>, <p eid="para_660"> Regarding undocumented workers, the Minister will be in receipt of a letter issued by the CEOs of the civil society organisations calling for the regularisation of undocumented children, young people and workers. I will quote from a letter I received, and which the Minister himself will have received. It states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_661">Undocumented workers have stepped up and continue to work providing essential services in this crisis. They are working in sectors where Ireland needs workers right now – in elder care, healthcare, retail, cleaning, food processing, agriculture and fishing.</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_662">There is broad based support for the regularisation of undocumented people – from the public, business, civil society, and across all major political parties in Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_663">Could the Minister confirm whether the Government will commit to regularising the legal status of those undocumented persons currently carrying out essential front-line services, as care workers in particular?</p>, <p eid="para_664"> The second issue concerns the operational status of An Garda Síochána. I acknowledge the reference the Minister made in his statement to the Policing Authority report, but it is worth quoting from the report, which states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_665">In the previous set of figures released by An Garda Síochána, for the period 8 to 25 April, there were 760 such incidents. This means an additional 412 incidents have been recorded or confirmed in the past week (a 54% increase). It is noted that some of these incidents may have occurred prior to the 26th April but were not included in previous totals due to not being validated</p>, <p eid="para_666">The report set out the issues in respect of the policing of Covid. It further states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_667">Approximately 22% of the offences relate to public order, while a further 16% relate to simple drug possession. General road offences was the third most frequent offence classification, accounting for approximately 10%. However, when all types of road offences are combined, they account for almost 32%.</p>, <p eid="para_668"> In tandem with that, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties submitted a detailed letter to the Garda Commissioner setting out issues and queries regarding the implementation by the Garda of the regulations introduced on 7 April. Those regulations amend the 1947 regulations. The 1947 regulations, for instance, have powers of enforcement that can be invoked that include the power of entry onto private premises where the regulations are being breached. For instance, the holding of a party on a private property is an offence under the regulations on the part of the guests because they have left their homes without a reasonable excuse, and on the part of the host because he or she is hosting the unauthorised event.</p>, <p eid="para_669"> Is the Minister satisfied that the statistics put forward by the Garda Commissioner show there is a low level of use of those enforcement powers and that there is a need then to ensure that we return to normal policing as quickly as possible? Inherent within that, as we move to the next phase on 18 May, in terms of the normalisation of society, as it were, and as we move through the phases beyond that, we must have regard to the regulations in the 1947 Act. Is it the Minister's intention to relax or lift those regulations or what does he propose to do in respect of them? We are fast approaching 18 May but at this point, we do not have sight of his intentions in respect of the powers of the Garda. It would be very useful for us to have some perspective from him.</p>, <p eid="para_670"> Similar to other Deputies, I also seek assurances from the Minister that the Garda has access to the requisite PPE now and will have as we move through those phases. Further, has consideration been given by the Government or by him to priority testing and results for An Garda Síochána in respect of Covid-19?</p>, <p eid="para_671">My third point relates to direct provision. I share the concerns of other Deputies with regard to Cahersiveen. It is important that the Minister speak to the Cahersiveen issue specifically. It would be worthwhile. The Minister made no specific reference to it in his speech but I would like to hear from him in that respect. In his speech, the Minister said that 7,700 people are being supported under direct provision at present. On social and physical distancing supports and cocooning measures, he said "More than 600 residents have relocated to support social and physical distancing and cocooning measures in centres." There are 7,700 people in direct provision and, according to the Minister's speech, 600 people have been moved into safer accommodation. Will the Minister give us his perspective on the next phase? How far along are the Minister and his Department with regard to ensuring the safety of those who reside in direct provision centres?</p>, <p eid="para_672"> Will a Garda task force be set up for County Louth and for Drogheda in particular? Points regarding policing in this specific region have been raised by other speakers. Following on from that, what is the status of the Garda task force for Dublin's north inner city?</p>, <p eid="para_673"> If I have time to come back in, I would be grateful for the opportunity, but I doubt I will.</p>]
