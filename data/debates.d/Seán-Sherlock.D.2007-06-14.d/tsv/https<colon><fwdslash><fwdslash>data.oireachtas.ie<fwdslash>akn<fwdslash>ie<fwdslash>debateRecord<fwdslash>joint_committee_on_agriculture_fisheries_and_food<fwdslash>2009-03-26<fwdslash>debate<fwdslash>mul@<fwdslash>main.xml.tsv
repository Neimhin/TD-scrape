SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the organisations here today.  My questions are quite specific.  Where are the scientific assumptions underlying the preservation of cod stocks coming from?  Do both organisations agree with those assumptions?  Do they agree that the Council regulations put in place for the preservation of cod stocks represent the right way to go for a sustainable industry?Do the witnesses feel that the green paper on the Common Fisheries Policy will present a real political opportunity to overhaul that policy?  Do they think that it will come down to the same, last minute EU Council negotiations and will pan out in a beggar thy neighbour process?  We always talk about what a great resource fisheries could be, but if this green paper is to mean anything, there will have to be real political change.  Do the witnesses think there will be real political change to bring about the type of industry they want to see?Mr. Maddock stated that the IFO is totally opposed to the new regime because it is designed to split fishermen, will increase the value of some licences and make a number of licences worthless.  Can he clarify what he means?  I am still a little bit at sea — pardon the pun — in terms of my understanding of the assumptions governing the regulation on the limits of kilowatts per day in the Celtic Sea.  Can somebody elaborate on that for me?Is it possible to quantify how many boats will be adversely affected as a result of the restriction on mesh sizes?  When he spoke about net sizes, Mr. Ó Cinnéide stated that the other stocks are in a relatively healthy state.  Can he elaborate on that?
