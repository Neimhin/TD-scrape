[<p eid="para_505">There are measures in the Finance Bill that are laudable, such as the welcome measures to encourage companies to invest in environmentally-friendly equipment.  The measures under the save as you earn scheme are also a step in the right direction.  The health measures, such as the VAT reduction on non-oral contraceptives, including condoms, do not go far enough.  It is our contention that the Minister should have further reduced the rate to 5%, in line with the EU VAT directive.</p>, <p eid="para_506">I will specifically refer to the research and development tax credit.  The Minister should fix indefinitely 2003 as the base year for availing of the tax credit.  The Bill, as I understand it, extends the base year of 2003 for the purposes of the research and development tax credit for a further four years to 31 December 2013.  However, the Bill provides that the subsequent years' expenditure, for calculating the incremental spend, will be the ten years before the end of the relevant accounting period.  For example, 2014 will have a base year of 2004.  One can compare this to the UK position, which is based not on an incremental position but on all research and development spend.  This gives the UK a comparative advantage so we should consider adopting this approach.</p>, <p eid="para_507">If there is a new Minister of State responsible for innovation policy, I assume the Government is giving the notion of intellectual policy and innovation some degree of stature.  A gesture such as this would assist many companies and enterprises throughout the country which are increasingly endeavouring to heighten research and development spend.</p>, <p eid="para_508">Considering the matter <i>vis-à-vis</i> foreign direct investment and its current unstable nature, we will have to rely on many indigenous industries.  Much work is being done within universities and third level institutions, and many spin-off companies are established from that and through venture capital.  Research and development will increasingly be a component of this process so we should incentivise it where possible.  Fixing 2003 as the base year rather than just limiting the credit to 2013 would have provided increased certainty and would have been a more favourable measure.</p>, <p eid="para_509">I will comment on my constituency of Cork East and the relevance of this Bill to such a constituency, where unemployment figures are rising.  It has been proven that in towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Cobh and Midleton, the figures are going up year on year.  The current Amgen issue——</p>]
[<p eid="para_511">I have an answer to a parliamentary question which clearly proves the unemployment figures are rising.  I can make them available to the Minister of State if he so wishes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_514">We are currently losing jobs in Cork East.</p>]
[<p eid="para_516">We have lost traditional industries and, for example, the food industry is not what it once was and is going into decline.  Irish Sugar is no longer with us and Dairygold is downsizing its operation.  There is increasing uncertainty about Amgen.  In trying to be positive about how we proceed economically and taking north and east Cork as a region, if a similar situation becomes evident, we will have to rely on indigenous industries.  The Government must proactively seek to upskill those people working within existing industries and introduce some measures for employers to enable them to upskill and grow existing companies.  There are many family-based companies in these towns and I am sure they could do with some incentivisation to grow.  The Government should consider the issue given the current global economic climate.  I am not advocating looking inward but we can start thinking more locally about how to provide incentives to grow jobs.</p>, <p eid="para_517">These are the essential points I have sought to cover.  I would have liked the Finance Bill to provide for some composite scheme like the town renewal or urban renewal schemes.  Towns such as Mitchelstown, Mallow and, to a lesser extent, Fermoy are still characterised by certain areas where development has not kept pace with corresponding development on the outskirts of towns.  The Government could be in a position to consider some urban renewal scheme or an adjunct to the existing programme.  I realise a Goodbody report on the performance of the urban renewal schemes was published which indicated a slow take-up in some aspects of the schemes.  The climate is right for towns such as Mallow, Fermoy and Mitchelstown to benefit from those schemes so we could get rid of some of the dereliction still existing within the towns.</p>, <p eid="para_518">I have probably used much less than 11 minutes but I do not believe in filling time for the sake of it.  I have covered the points I wished to make and others which I could expand have been expounded upon by our finance spokesperson.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board.  I will be very happy to make the figures available to the Minister of State which prove beyond any doubt that unemployment figures have increased exponentially in these towns.</p>]
