SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	2014-05-08T12:00:00+01:00	Rather than delivering the speech circulated, I will cut straight to the point with regard to St. Paul's secondary school. Gabhaim míle buíochas leis an Seanadóir as an gcuireadh. I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I can advise him that the school's application for accommodation to replace its prefabs has been examined by the Department. Enrolments in the school have been stable in recent years. I am pleased to advise the Senator that approval has been granted to St. Paul's secondary school to replace its existing prefab with a permanent structure, which will address its accommodation needs. The school has been advised of this decision. I also wish to advise the Senator that funding has recently been approved under the 2014 summer works scheme, with which the Senator will be familiar, to facilitate the repair of the roof of the school building. These works and the replacement of the prefab at the school should ensure the medium-term and long-term accommodation requirements of St. Paul's secondary school are met. I thank the Senator again for giving me an opportunity to clarify the current position on St. Paul's secondary school in Oughterard i gContae na Gaillimhe.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2014-05-08T12:00:00+01:00	A pragmatic approach is being taken to schools like St. Paul's secondary school which are not included in the so-called five-year plan. If the case they make is strong enough and stands on its own merits, officials in the Department can exercise a degree of common sense. That is obviously the case in this scenario and, as a result, I am confident these facilities will be replaced expeditiously.
