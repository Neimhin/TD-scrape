SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I welcome the officials.  What is the relationship between Coillte and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in deciding on the payment of a grant of €45 per linear metre?  Is it possible to determine how much Coillte has benefited?Does the forest road scheme have regard to thinning?  I note the definition of "thinning" included in the introductory statement.  There is a reference to outcomes.  I can only surmise that the outcomes have been negative in terms of thinnings in certain parts of the country.  However, I may be wrong and may be hitting the wrong angle and, if so, I stand to be corrected.What we have in the south, particularly in my constituency, is HGV traffic operating on Coillte land.  While access to the forest at certain points is extremely good, certain roads are substandard as a result of the excessive volume of HGV traffic.  HGVs should not go near these roads, but they are being used as rat-runs to gain access to the forestry.  Does the Department have a role in this regard or is it a matter for the local authority?  If it is a matter for the local authority, I hope this will be taken into account when allocations are being made under the scheme.  In Ballyhoura in north Cork certain roads are in an atrocious state, but beyond a certain point, the standard of the surface is better than on the Cork to Dublin road.  There is an inconsistency
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I would like the issue to be addressed.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Forgive me because my earlier question may have been long-winded and could have been misunderstood.  Some 80% of the eligible costs are subject to €45 per linear metre, and with a budget of €18 million, by how much did Coillte benefit from that?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	How much will Coillte earn potentially?  Is Ms Nolan saying that is far as it can go?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I could table a parliamentary question, but could I have a breakdown of by how much Coillte has benefited from this scheme, including the geographical locations involved?  I would also like to know the geographical locations where private entities have benefited from these schemes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	I am trying to get a sense of the scheme.  Forgive me if we are not totally au fait with the workings of the scheme; maybe we should be.  I do not mean to be facetious, but forestry road schemes are not on top of the list.  Now that the officials are here, however, I would like to get the pounds, shillings and pence of where the money is going.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	Yes.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	That is a good question.
