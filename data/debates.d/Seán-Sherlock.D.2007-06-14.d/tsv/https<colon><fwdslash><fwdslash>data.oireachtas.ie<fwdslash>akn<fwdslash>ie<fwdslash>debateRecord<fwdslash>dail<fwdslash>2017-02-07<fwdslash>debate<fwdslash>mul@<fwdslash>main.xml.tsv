[<p eid="para_402">I wish the Minister well. It is good to see him back on his feet and at his desk.</p>, <p eid="para_403"> My question relates to the universal service obligation. Does the Minister have a timeframe and what are his detailed plans for revising the current universal service obligation for telephony services from basic copper telephony to ensure high-speed broadband connectivity and to ensure it is available as an enforceable right?</p>]
[<p eid="para_408">Is the Minister saying that the Government's position is that it is without ambiguity seeking a USO for all premises and citizens? How many people in the Minister's Department are working on the national broadband plan? The Minister speaks of people being left behind, and across the political landscape we all acknowledge those people, but when will nobody be left behind? What is the reasonable expectation of people who do not have adequate coverage for the roll-out and 100% penetration?</p>]
[<p eid="para_410">I would be very grateful if the Minister could revert to me with an indicative timeframe. It is also important that we know exactly how many staff are working on this important infrastructural project in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Is the Minister planning for a scenario in which litigation is taken by one or more of the potential bidders for the national broadband plan? Is the Department making plans for such a potential scenario as we speak?</p>]
