SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-11-20T15:00:00+00:00	The Labour Party supported that motion as well, for the record. The An Post mail centre in Cork, we are told, is now under threat of closure, with the potential loss of 200 jobs. I am asking the Minister if he can confirm that that is the case. It would have a devastating effect on postal services in the southern region. I also want to raise the issue of the promise that was made in respect of a new post office that was supposed to be tendered for in Kilworth, County Cork, which has not come on stream yet. Does An Post intend to close the Cork mail centre, with the loss of 200 jobs? We need confirmation on that.
