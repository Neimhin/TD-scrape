SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T14:40:00+01:00	I compliment Deputy Eamon Ryan on the wonderful shirt he is wearing today.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T14:40:00+01:00	It is a very tropical issue indeed. In respect of the new plan by the Government, the word "ambitious" is perhaps verbose in the circumstances. It is our view that the plan is less ambitious than the 42 recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, which were made in March. The risks of failing to act are enormous when we consider future generations. We have 12 years left to reduce emissions drastically. If we do not achieve massive and rapid decarbonisation, we are facing climate breakdown with enormous consequences globally for failing to act. We all acknowledge this as a fact at this stage. There is unprecedented scientific consensus on the need to start reducing emissions by between 5% and 10% per annum starting now. However, this plan aims to reduce emissions by just 2% each year from 2021 to 2030 and then by 7% each year after 2030. The worry I have about the Government's plan is that if we kick these targets further down the road and fail to act today, we will miss the 2030 targets by a significant margin. The plan delays action relative to what we said we would do in the joint committee. This delay is based on a red herring that new technologies will somehow emerge to reduce emissions. We already have the solutions we need; we need the political will and the policies to implement them. We brought in a lot of expertise in the joint committee and worked out how many of these solutions could best be implemented now. It is the view of the Labour Party that the Government's plan takes some of those actions and waters them down. The joint committee agreed that new climate legislation would be enacted by the Oireachtas in 2019 and that it would contain several crucial new governance structures, including emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 and carbon budgets to map out the quantity of emissions allowable in each five-year period. The Government's plan now rolls back on the all-party recommendation and instead says it will publish legislation in March 2020.This House has already declared a climate emergency. It could be late 2020 before the Government's legislation sees the light of day and is passed by the Oireachtas and another year will have passed. The joint committee felt strongly that carbon budgets were an excellent way to plan for emissions reductions in a way that is transparent and accountable. We have been pushing for them but the Government's climate action plan departs considerably from the UK plan, on which we kicked the tyres, as it were, in the joint committee. Unlike the UK plan, on which the committee formulated its recommendations for planning and setting carbon budgets up to 2035, the Government plan allows carbon budgets to be changed every five years. The whole point of setting the budgets in law well in advance is to safeguard the process from short-term political horse trading. We need to make sure that carbon budgets are done properly when it comes to laying down the procedure in a new or amended climate Act. On the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action agreed that new functions and powers should be given to the climate council in line with the Citizens' Assembly recommendations. These should include greater capacity and a bigger budget to match the greater demands being placed on this important climate body. The Government's action plan, however, does not allocate the extra capacity or resources that are needed. We need to make sure we are doing things right. I hope this matter will be revisited. On home energy retrofits, the new Government plan sets a target of upgrading 500,000 homes to a B energy rating by 2030. The joint committee's plan had already agreed to put the measures in place to deliver 800,000 deep energy retrofits by 2030. There is now a gap between the joint committee's ambitious recommendations and targets and the Government's targets. It is our view that the Government plan rows back significantly on what we agreed in March. Instead of showing an urgency to deliver home energy retrofits, it commits to a nominal increase in the existing national target as laid down in the national development plan. There is huge unmet potential in Ireland for community-owned energy. Community energy is a way to collectively reduce energy demand and achieve renewable energy targets. It does this with local, social and economic benefits. It democratises energy generation and could go a long way towards helping to meet anticipated strong growth in energy demand in the period until 2030. Against all expectations, the Government plan does not do anything more to encourage and support community energy than what was already committed to under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS. The timeline is no more than what is already required under existing EU targets. Again, we perceive a lack of ambition on the part of the Government plan. We need to remove the barriers to entry for community energy projects and have a ring-fenced pot for community energy in the first RESS auction. These recommendations were in the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action but are not in the Government plan. Peatlands restoration may offer a nature-based solution to climate change. The joint committee proposed many actions on nature based solutions which are not reflected in this report. We need to use nature to capture carbon and keep it in the ground. This new plan refers to peatland re-wetting but does not contain any targets or specific measures. The joint committee did considerable work on this. The Labour Party sought targets to restore 200,000 ha of natural and cutover peatlands and 50,000 ha of industrially harvested peatlands by 2030. This is not an issue specifically for the line Minister, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan. We had some deliberation with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, on this matter yesterday. There must be a whole-of-Government response on this issue. We contend that resources must be provided to address the urgent need to start a major re-wetting programme to stop existing emissions from peatlands. This feeds into the just transition issue. While the proposal to establish a just transition review group under the auspices of the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is welcome, we would also argue that the just transition task force must address or have the capability to address the issues that arise in the midlands. On forestry, rather than the industrially managed monocultures of Sitka spruce, we need to shift to continuous cover forestry with a better mix of tree species. This type of forestry is far better at capturing carbon, is better for the environment and would provide more higher-value jobs in direct employment and in local industries. The Government plan relies heavily on forestry to soak away carbon but contains nothing about the sustainability and environmental performance of the forestry models to be used. This is a climate issue and needs to be treated as one. The new plan refers to a climate action delivery board. There must to be further deliberations on this. I welcome the discussions we had with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in the joint committee yesterday on how the climate action delivery board will work but it remains the view of the joint committee that, in buttressing the powers and resources of the Climate Change Advisory Council, one has an independent council that sits outside of the Government that can put smacht - or manners - on the Government of the day. It becomes an issue if too much of the plan depends on what is happening in the Government and through the individual Departmental silos. Without any proper oversight or real power vested in an independent council, I fear there would be slippage in the targets. Notwithstanding the presence of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who sought to knock down many of the silos that exist within Government, having been in Government, I recognise that if individual line Departments are protecting their own briefs and edifices, I worry about the danger of the overarching policy or plan becoming bogged down in internecine and interdepartmental wars. For this reason, we need proper oversight of the plan to ensure carbon budgeting is nailed down and has a legislative base, with a statutory carrot and stick to ensure the plan gets delivered. I would like to see greater dovetailing and interoperability between the plan and the recommendations of the joint committee. We must remember that the recommendations of the joint committee reflected the findings of the Citizens' Assembly. As such, the committee's report came directly from the people. Some work was needed to get 42 distinct and separate voices together to agree, by and large, a set of policies, principles and recommendations. This is why I am hopeful the Government and Minister of the day will lean more towards the report's recommendations because they are radical and take more of them on board as the plan moves through its iterative process.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T15:50:00+01:00	I am delighted to wholeheartedly welcome the Bill. I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing it before the House. We have been through quite a process since 2016 in seeking to have this placed firmly on the agenda and I am delighted to be part of a process where we are in agreement with the Government's Bill on the important issue of banning microbeads. I acknowledge Senator Grace O'Sullivan's role in this because she started the ball rolling. When her Bill was rejected by the Government on the basis of Single Market issues and certain articles in the EU treaty, we took up the cudgels. As has been stated, we used the precedent of the smoking ban as a mechanism to progress the issue through the introduction of our own Bill. I recall speaking on Second Stage of that legislation on 4 May 2017 and acknowledging that it was not being opposed at that juncture and that I would gladly withdraw it if I saw the colour of the Government's money. I am glad that the Minister has delivered on the promise that was made. While I am possibly in uncharted territory in that I may be the only member of the Opposition to withdraw a Private Members' Bill, which I am not sure there is precedent for, on the basis of a commitment the Government gave to introduce its own legislation, I did so on trust. I am glad to state that my trust was repaid with the publication of the Bill before us. The passing of this legislation could be the Minister's greatest legacy. Future generations will thank this House for legislating in respect of this very important issue. Notwithstanding that, we all know what microplastics and microbeads are. I do not need to speak about their effect on the environment. We are all well-educated on the effect that they have for marine and other life in our watercourses and the oceans. I have a question on a matter to which Deputy Ó Broin referred. I refer to the lack of intention on the part of the Government to target leave-on or wear-off products at this time. I know it is not possible for the Minister, his officials or any of the agencies of State to police the daily ablutions of citizens regarding what they do in their own bathrooms but we have to acknowledge that, even when the Bill is enacted, the risk that microplastics will still enter our watercourses and the oceans. I want the Minister and his officials to clarify the position in respect of the leave-on products.The Minister stated:Although there are readily available alternative ingredients to replace plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetic products, manufacturers cannot currently reformulate leave-on cosmetic products as easily. The impact to the cosmetics industry and to consumers would be enormous if such a blanket ban was introduced at this time.The primary purpose of the legislation is not to take on the cosmetics industry, its modus operandi is for an environmental good, to ensure future marine life and human health so that we are not ingesting this plastic back into our systems. We already have an evidence base which shows us that sea life is already consuming plastics and it is inherent within it and humans as well. I am worried if we are not going the whole hog in terms of banning microbeads outright and if we are introducing an exception. I hope the Minister will allay my fears when he replies. If we have to wait for a six-year lead-in time for restricting leave-on cosmetic products on the basis that he is allowing for product reformulation, then I am fearful that we may be in a position where we will not have tackled the problem fully. I accept the Minister's bona fides in respect of the Irish position but I am concerned because, as Deputy Ó Broin indicated, the cosmetics lobby has more direct access to the European Commission than any member state in terms of the efficacy of its lobbying. It could seek to put a stay on any legislative proposals coming from the Commission in respect of wiping out the use of microbeads in cosmetics altogether. I hope my concerns in this regard will be addressed. I have a question on the maximum size of microbeads, which is referred to as being 5 mm. Does any industry standard specify 5 mm? Was the figure determined on the basis of advice received from particular entities or scientific advisers? It is not that I doubt the 5 mm specification in any way but I am interested in the logic behind it. I welcome the legislation and thank the Minister for bringing it before the House. I acknowledge that he delivered on the commitment he gave that he would legislate in respect of this issue. I also acknowledge that all Members of this House, in a non-partisan way and through the interventions they have made, are very clear regarding their intention to seek to have this matter legislated for.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T16:10:00+01:00	If I am not mistaken, when the Minister was referring to leave-on products I believe he could have been referring to what might loosely be termed "cosmeceuticals", where there is marketing of a cosmetic that claims to have a medical benefit. I am not sure if that is where he was going with this but there must be clarity on Committee Stage, notwithstanding the points he made about delaying the legislation. If we do not fully legislate for the abolition of microbeads or if there is any doubt about that in terms of passing legislation in the House in which there is a massive amount of exceptions, it defeats the purpose of the Bill.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T16:10:00+01:00	This issue arises from the proposed takeover of GlaxoSmithKline, GSK, in Cork by Thermo Fischer Scientific. It has given rise to concerns on the part of the workers and their representatives, specifically SIPTU which represents the majority of the affected workers. They relate to the interpretation or perceived lack of adherence to the regulations in respect of the transfer of undertakings regulations of 2003. The trade union SIPTU has written to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, but I understand the matter is now in the bailiwick of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty. I will quote from a letter I received in respect of concerns that were raised with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. It refers to:...GSK management's announcement that they have failed to consult fully with the union and merely put in place a communications strategy to inform our members of both employers' unilateral decisions to change existing terms and conditions of employment. The type of unilateral changes communicated by both employers to workers have far reaching economic impact on our members for example the ceasing of the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, fundamental changes to the Bonus scheme, non-transfer of annual leave entitlements, ceasing of the revenue approved share purchase scheme.They are just some of the issues that have arisen. The workers in GSK were informed by their employers on 16 May last that the plant, which employs over 400 people, was to be sold to Thermo Fischer Scientific "under transfer of undertaking for the purposes of the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003...". In plain English, one entity has been taken over by another. There were pre-existing and longstanding agreements collectively arrived at and it is feared that they will now be pushed aside. These relate to holidays, sick pay and other changes the employees will have to incur, particularly with regard to their pension entitlements or a previously negotiated pension arrangement. Any entity, regardless of what it is, must be compliant with the law. I am raising this with the Government to ensure that the workers in GSK and Thermo Fischer Scientific are protected in law and that a process is put in place forthwith through the machinery of the State, be it the Labour Court or through a conciliation process, whereby the Government is watchful of what is happening and ensure it is aware of the situation so there will be a proper dialogue between the two sides to ensure no worker's rights are undermined in any way.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T16:20:00+01:00	I welcome the fact that the Minister clearly and unambiguously stated the law. A Minister who sits at Cabinet has stated, on the record of this House, the law of the land in respect of this issue. I hope that any parties bearing witness to this exchange are mindful of this. However, he also stated, "I currently have no reason to believe that the companies involved will not comply with the legislation." I have no way of knowing that and I am sure the Minister of State has no way of knowing it because he is taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. I am hopeful that, by virtue of the fact that we have raised this issue, some process can be entered into whereby the Minister of State's colleagues in Cabinet will take heed of the main provisions of the regulations, as he has clearly set them out. As a Minister of State who sits at Cabinet has set out the regulations on the record of the House, I am pretty sure the parties involved will take heed of them.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-06-20T17:50:00+01:00	I record my gratitude to the Chairman, Deputy Ó Caoláin, and the committee for bringing forward a very insightful report and a set of recommendations that I feel are based on common sense, are very pragmatic and should be easily implementable. Arising from those recommendations, I acknowledge the contribution the Police Service of Northern Ireland made to the committee in respect of some of the initiatives in which it is involved, particularly in respect of the use of social media. There are approximately 900,000 followers of the PSNI and it is used as a very good mechanism for communication. Given the times we live in, and notwithstanding the good work of Muintir na Tíre, which is also acknowledged in the report - the text message alerts are very useful and should be retained and resourced - there are also the other forms of social media that present an opportunity for gardaí and the population to engage in a proactive and preventative way where incidents occur. I was struck today by the intervention of the representative of the Garda Representative Association on "Morning Ireland" in respect of issues in Longford. He mentioned that the force there was operating on a fire brigade basis, which is how he put it. The import was that gardaí are reacting and that they are providing all-to-call service. If nothing else, this report and its recommendations seek to move us away from that towards a more reflective type of policing mechanism, where gardaí are on the ground, gathering intelligence on a day-to-day basis, and they can engage with people actively in a way that prevents crime from happening. If we can take the recommendations in this report and inculcate them into the policing model that is evolving, and let us acknowledge how it is evolving, and if we can achieve that in a pragmatic and sensible way, we could do a lot to prevent what is happening in the towns and cities of the State, and prevent a lot of crime. We acknowledge there are increasing resources and the magic number is 15,000, if I am not mistaken. However, while seeking to reach that point, we have to try to prevent incidents such as those that are happening in Longford and other parts of the State. If the local GRA representatives are saying we are operating a fire brigade service where we are reacting to incidents and it is very hard to keep on top of that because there is a lack of resources and a need for a stronger Garda presence, then we need to look carefully at what is being said and react positively to it. I welcome what is a very progressive report. The proposals and recommendations in regard to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 warrant further investigation and attention. The report states: "The Committee believes that, whilst some collaboration does exist between An Garda Síochána and other organisations to provide community-based services in Ireland, much more needs to be done to implement a properly structured and effective multi-agency model." It also states:The Crime and Disorder Act (1998) defines the core group of agencies involved in these partnerships, as well as their functions and role at the local level. The Committee recommends that serious consideration be given to introducing similar legislation in Ireland.There is a lot of common sense in that. It could be that this thinking is already taking place within the Department and with the Garda Commissioner. If that is put on some sort of a statutory footing and formalised, it would have a massive impact in terms of how policing is done on this island. I welcome the report, which is a very good template to work from. The Minister has welcomed the report. I congratulate the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, in particular its Chairman, Deputy Ó Caoláin, for a very positive intervention.
