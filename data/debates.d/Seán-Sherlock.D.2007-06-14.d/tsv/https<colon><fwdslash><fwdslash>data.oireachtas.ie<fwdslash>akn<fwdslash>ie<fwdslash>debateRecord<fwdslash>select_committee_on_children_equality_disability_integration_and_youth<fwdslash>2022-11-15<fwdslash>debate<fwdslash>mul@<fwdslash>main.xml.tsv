[<p eid="para_15">I move amendment No. 1:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_16">In page 5, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_17">
<b>“Report on operation of Scheme</b>
</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_18"><b>2. </b>(1) The Minister shall cause a report on the operation of the Scheme to be commenced on the day that is six months after the establishment day and to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after its completion.</p>, <p class="indent_2" eid="para_19">(2) A report under this section shall consider the following matters:</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_20">(a) whether and to what extent persons engaged in the management, administration or operation of relevant institutions should be permitted or required to contribute to the cost of making payments under this Act;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_21">(b) whether the 180 days residence requirement provided for in<i> section 13(1)</i> and <i>(4)</i> should be amended or repealed;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_22">(c) whether the Scheme should be extended so as to make provision for recognising persons who were boarded out as children as relevant persons;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_23">(d) whether there is a need to provide for additional institutions in Schedule 1;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_24">(e) whether the requirement imposed on applicants by <i>section 27(3) </i>should be removed;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_25">(f) whether the duration of the Scheme should be extended;</p>, <p class="indent_3" eid="para_26">(g) whether payment rates under the Scheme should be increased.”.</p>, <p eid="para_27">Those are all self-explanatory. I am not sure what the Minister's position is; we will hear from him shortly. We feel certain issues are not contained within the legislative proposal before us. I have been told that the amendment is in order. One of the limited tools we in opposition have is to seek reports on the issues that are pertinent to the many people who feel left out and feel that they should be included in the Bill. The amendment would at least allow for a report on those issues affecting those people who see themselves as being excluded by the Bill.</p>]
[<p eid="para_46">We need to delve further into what the Minister is saying as to what he will return with on Report Stage. The question is now whether I withdraw or press my amendment. I am of a mind to press it. Before I do, however, I will signal my intention to propose another such amendment on Report Stage. I will say that for the record. We will wait and see what the Minister has to offer on Report Stage.</p>, <p eid="para_47"> On the issue of the 180 days, the reason for our amendment is that we feel strongly that the issues of temporary absence and the 180 days under section 13 are hanging like the sword of Damocles. There needs to be some reporting mechanism to speak for those people. I ask that the Minister come back on Report Stage with some language in that regard because what the Minister is proposing in section 13 seems too strident or prescriptive. It refers to a person who "was resident in a relevant institution for not less than 180 days, shall be entitled to a general payment in respect of the number of days, referred to in <i>column 2</i> of <i>Schedule 2</i> at any reference number, during which the person was so resident". What we are trying to do is to speak for those people who left, came back again and left again. They do not seem to be encompassed by what the Minister has brought before us. As my colleagues, Deputies Funchion and Cairns, stated, more than 60% of children are not deemed to be eligible for redress and not covered by this legislation. We have to find some way to address that. I feel that my questions during the Second Stage debate as to the modelling or cost permutations the Department has considered with regard to the exclusion of the category of people who spent less than six months in a home have still not been definitively answered. The justification for not including those people has not been provided. I do not think those people can be excluded. Whatever the reporting mechanism looks like, it has to include those people as well because they have a voice.</p>, <p eid="para_48">That is the bottom line.</p>]
[<p eid="para_60">I appreciate the point the Minister makes about the 180 days. I may have misinterpreted that initially so I take that point. Speaking to the amendment, however, the question is merely whether the 180 days' residence requirement provided for should be amended or repealed. First, I hold to the view that a report into that is still a reasonable ask. Second is the question as to whether the requirement imposed on applicants by section 27(3) should be removed. The logic of where I am coming from here is that if somebody was resident in a relevant institution for up to and including 89 days, the general payment is €5,000. That is according to Schedule 3. The total amount, therefore, is €5,000. The Minister's subsection (3) states that if one receives a payment of €5,000, one "shall not [and I stress "shall not"] institute civil proceedings, and shall discontinue any other proceedings instituted by or on behalf of the applicant". My worry about that is that there is the compensation, which in these instances is small, but there is also the issue of the seeking of justice, whereby a person will seek to have recourse to the courts. I just wonder what the legal basis of signing a waiver will be to that end. By dint of this legislation, I cannot help but feel that the Minister is restricting people from being able to seek recourse to the courts in seeking to have justice applied to themselves, which is a fundamental right that people have. Is the Minister taking that right away from them if they sign this waiver stating they have received their €5,000 and can no longer institute or take any further proceedings? I am not a lawyer. I would defer to legal experts on this one. Is the Minister entitled to do that? Obviously, he feels he is because, otherwise, he would not legislate for it, but what is the legal strength of such a waiver? How is it to be written? Is it a contract? Is it a <i>pro forma</i> form that will be handled by an administrator within the Department? How does the Minister envisage that this would be dealt with?</p>, <p eid="para_61"> Finally, and I thank you for your latitude, Chair, that is why I sought to have a report into how this will operate. If a hundred people come forward, for the sake of argument, at €5,000 per person, some of those people may feel that they would like recourse to the courts on this and that, while they have signed a waiver, they still have a right to go to the courts. I do not think we should disbar those people from going to the courts. That is where I am coming from.</p>]
[<p eid="para_104">I refer to having some regard to the role that public representatives, Deputies, Senators and others, will have in advocating on behalf of the people they represent who will interface with this new office. What is being created here seems similar to the Department of Social Protection, and it is normal practice for us to interface with that Department and the HSE on regular payments being paid out by the State. This is particularly the case regarding the Department of Social Protection. I hope the role of Deputies, Senators and others would be recognised and that we would not be hampered by the general data protection regulation, GDPR, if permissions and consents are given to us to advocate on behalf of our constituents. I refer to us being recognised as public representatives to some degree in interfacing with such a body. I say this because not everybody will be able to make their own case in this context.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I am stretching this, so I beg the Acting Chair's indulgence. I ask that the Minister show some caution. There was a time when we could approach Irish Water with representations and those would go into a central repository, where they would be handled by a third party and so on. There are issues around that. I will be so bold as to make a suggestion. I take the Minister's point that it should not necessarily be put on a statutory basis, but there has to be recognition of the role of the public representative. People need to have advocates on their behalf, and that is largely a role that we all have as public representatives. I would not like to see the organisation writing back to the person who is making the representation on the basis of the length of time he or she spent in an institution saying that the organisation will not speak to Deputy Sherlock on the matter and he has nothing to do with it. The system and culture of the organisation must be ones of interfacing with the public and must recognise us as public representatives acting on behalf of people. This is where I am coming from - I should have been clearer about it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_121">We will take a look at it again, but a thought occurs to me in respect of payments that accrue to persons who are deemed eligible for a payment. Has there been a discussion with the Department of Social Protection on how these payments are dealt with when assessing means for other payments under that Department's rules?</p>]
[<p eid="para_123">Is that clearly stated in the legislation?</p>]
[<p eid="para_127">Up to and including all payments under the Schedule. The Minister is allowing for payments of up to €125,000.</p>]
[<p eid="para_150">I seek further clarification concerning the chief deciding officer. We are talking about an enhanced medical card. There are physiological elements to that. Are psychological elements taken into account? I am trying to get the Minister on the record saying they are, so that if issues arise down the line, we can refer back to committee debates. These are thoughts that are occurring to me as are seeking to legislate here <i>in situ</i>. I am trying to think of the person who presents with trauma or psychological issues where there are psychiatric or psychological reports. Forgive me if I am misinterpreting the circumstances in which the enhanced medical card will be granted.</p>]
[<p eid="para_152">And that is it.</p>]
[<p eid="para_154">I suppose I am so culturally entwined in Department of Social Protection schemes, where you seek to fight cases on behalf of people, that it is hard to decouple myself from that. Apologies.</p>]
