[<p eid="para_12">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a comprehensive statement to the House on the threat to health and safety posed by the estimated half a million tonnes of hazardous material containing chromium 6 and other toxins still on site at the former Irish Steel site at Haulbowline, County Cork; the reason the removal of the material was stopped by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the contractor was instructed to cap the materials; and the need for the Minister to outline what steps are now planned to remove this material to ensure that any risk to the health and safety of residents is removed.  In view of the importance of this request, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to it being taken.</p>]
[<p eid="para_332">I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I echo the sentiments of our spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, on this Bill.  The legislation, as it is put to us, and the subsequent statements by the Minister, would leave one wondering what is the purpose and content of this legislation.  There are few meaningful sections in the Bill.  The culture and sale of alcohol in this country would probably be better dealt with in the sale of alcohol Bill.  However there are some good provisions in the Bill that are worthy of support.</p>, <p eid="para_333">In this country we cannot talk about alcohol without its having some very deep cultural meaning.  Our relationship with alcohol has been ambiguous and we have spoken about it since Adam was a boy.  In my research I came across a study in the <i>Journal of Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland</i> entitled Issues for Irish Alcohol Policy: A Historical Perspective with some Lessons for the Future, published in 1991.  The author of that report, Mr. Daniel McCoy, cited a quotation: “No one can be competent to discuss the drink question unless he has thought over it sufficiently to realise how complicated the subject necessarily is.”  On page 21 of that study the author refers to historical views of the relationship we have with alcohol in this country:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_334">Irish drinking was seen as convivial rather than ritual and was used as a bonding with people of the same or other groups.  Irish people ... have a "social acceptance" of drunkenness something that is completely opposite to the Islamic view.</p>, <p eid="para_335">While I do not advocate that we all turn to Islam, neither do I advocate some of the points raised in this piece of legislation that seeks to modify behaviour.  For example, I do not believe the provision on sale of wine in supermarkets is good.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to reverse that trend.  The vast majority of people drink responsibly and like to imbibe and share a bottle of wine in their homes.  The notion that somebody would have to go to a supermarket that has an off-licence and ask for a bottle to be handed out by a member of staff so that he or she could handle it before purchase is ludicrous.  I am glad the Minister has reversed that provision.</p>, <p eid="para_336">I want to speak briefly on theatre licences.  There should not be uniform closing times for nightclubs.  Having hundreds of people spilling out onto the streets at one given time is not an effective method of regularising alcohol consumption, if that is the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Bill.  By modifying or regulating closing times in a very uniform way one will not modify behaviour.  The core of the legislation should be to seek to change the culture.  By staggering closing times, particularly for nightclubs with theatre licences, there would be more of a drip-feed onto the streets and it would be easier to control.  The legislation proposes to have CCTV cameras installed and that would be a good way to monitor the behaviour of clientele exiting onto streets at night time.  However restricting licences, particularly theatre licences, will not be a good way of modifying alcohol consumption.  The two do not correlate.</p>, <p eid="para_337">I have attended the Gaiety Theatre, which has a late licence, on a number of occasions.  According to its website, this weekend four different events will take place simultaneously in the theatre's four bars.  There will be a live band playing indie and retro music, on another stage there will be northern soul and there will also be some hip hop.  In a city the size of Dublin one is catering for a wide range of musical tastes and a clientele that likes to go out clubbing.  These people do not necessarily see themselves as deviant in any way when they have taken alcohol and will go home after enjoying a responsible night out.  Curbing that person's behaviour through legislation will not necessarily create a panacea for how alcohol is consumed in this country.  The vast majority of people behave responsibly, like to go out and have a varied night, such as the night provided by a facility such as the Gaiety Theatre.  Restricting those types of licences will not necessarily change the culture.  Although the alcohol advisory group made recommendations with regard to closing times, not all of its recommendations are necessarily contained in the Bill, from what I have read.  I repeat Deputy Pat Rabbitte's point that the sale of alcohol Bill must deal with the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption in this country by modifying closing times and the right to be able to purchase alcohol in a supermarket or off-licence.  Making provisions whereby a certain aspect of a supermarket has to be closed off and all alcohol moved behind a counter was totally ludicrous.  I welcome the changes announced in the Minister's speech and the overtones in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_338">With regard to early morning houses, while I understand the Bill must go through Committee Stage, as it is constituted at present it almost criminalises those who have early morning licences and seeks to convey an impression that anyone with such a licence is the purveyor of all sorts of iniquity.  Many people, some of them constituents of mine, have worked either as dockers or have worked night shifts all their lives.  Due to their pattern of sleeping following a night shift, they will enjoy a pint in the morning in the early house and will then proceed home in a proper and orderly fashion.  Of course, there have been instances where early houses have probably had some degree of anti-social behaviour but this is not outside the norm of any other establishment holding a normal licence.</p>, <p eid="para_339">The advisory group did not undertake any quantitative or qualitative studies.  I do not know of one licensee in the early morning trade to whom I spoke who had a visit from any departmental official during the framing of this legislation.  I believe this measure was included as an afterthought and I am glad the Minister has made some concessions in this regard.</p>, <p eid="para_340">In conclusion, I am glad the Minister has seen sense.  If we are talking about the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption, the link between the cultural aspects and education have to be expounded more vociferously by the Government.  The only way we will change the culture is by a process of education.  I do not believe some of the provisions in the Bill would necessarily change that culture and, in fact, they would drive alcohol more into an underground mode.  While I welcome the Bill in some respects, I am glad the changes the Minister has proposed will now be made.</p>]
[<p eid="para_741">Will the Minister of State acknowledge that the projected cost of fully cleaning up the site is estimated to be in the region of €300 million and that this was a determining factor in the Government's decision to send a letter to the contractors on 18 April, as reported in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, stating that the required course of action would be to “cap the lagoon with inert slag material (or other such suitable available material), pending a detailed risk assessment of the entire site”?  The Government found out how much it would cost to clean up the site and is now seeking to spin the matter in such a way as to suggest that the subcontractors on the site were acting outside their station or <i>ultra vires</i> and is now seeking to put the blame on them.  When the Government realised that it had unearthed such a problem, it refused to acknowledge it and sought to cover it up.  Its intention, in the first instance, was never to fully assess and continue the works that are necessary on the site.  </p>, <p eid="para_742">This is a bombshell to the people who reside in the vicinity of the site.  They thought that the Government was acting in good faith when it decided that the Haulbowline site would be cleared.  For the Government to state that the contract only covered above-surface works and not sub-surface works is an attempt to cover up the problem that exists from a subterranean point of view.  Its intention was never to expend the funds necessary to clean up the site and make it safe for those who reside and work in its vicinity.  I ask the Minister to specifically address the point in the letter dated 18 April 2008 because it is the most pertinent point relating to this issue.</p>]
