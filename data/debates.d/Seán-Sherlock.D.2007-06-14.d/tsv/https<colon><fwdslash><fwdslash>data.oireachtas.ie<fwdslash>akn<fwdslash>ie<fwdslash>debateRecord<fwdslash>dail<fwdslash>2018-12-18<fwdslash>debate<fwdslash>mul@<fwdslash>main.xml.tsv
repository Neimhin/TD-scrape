SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T16:20:00+00:00	The Minister attended the meeting in Katowice. It would be very useful for the House to understand his level of engagement with our multilateral partners and through the prism of the European Union.Arising from the new rule book that has been agreed with regard to putting the 2015 Paris Agreement into real action, will the Minister give me a sense of his vision in terms of the type of funding instruments the Government will use to move us to a rapid decarbonisation phase?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T16:30:00+00:00	The Minister addressed the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action on 5 December and made very specific references to the €500 million climate action fund. He has already said that there are seven major climate change projects that will share €77 million in Government funding. He also made reference to the sovereign green bond. If we are talking about how the decisions we will make by 2020 will determine whether global heating can be kept at 1.5° centigrade above pre-industrial levels, that expenditure will be vital in terms of programmes that will be put to good use on our own little island. I would like to hear the Minister tell us what sense of urgency exists across the Government with regard to deploying that funding in very specific areas like decarbonisation of buildings, transport networks and smart grids. I would like to get a sense from him that there is an urgency across Government with regard to its own response. If we are signing up to this rule book as per the 2015 Paris Agreement and if we are serious about hitting the pre-industrial targets in terms of mitigating against a 1.5° centigrade increase in temperature by 2020, what measures is the Government taking?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T16:30:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister's commitment, about which there is no question. In asking the question, I was trying to find out what the sense in Government is. I understand that the Minister has met the various line Departments but it is about a whole-of-Government approach led directly by the Taoiseach that recognises the urgency of the challenge and ensures that the net behavioural change that needs to happen so that we can hit these targets is implemented. I would not like to see this become too process-driven. I would like for it to be recognised across all line Departments that the silos within Government should be broken down and that this is probably one of the biggest challenges we will face as a country for the foreseeable future. I would like to see a massive response in terms of the initiatives that citizens can avail of in terms of better transport networks and decarbonising buildings such as public buildings and schools. I would like to get timelines from the Minister as to when he can start rolling out that funding for bespoke projects.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T17:10:00+00:00	The Joint Committee on Climate Action is sitting currently in response to the Citizens' Assembly report. Committee members visited Tipperary recently. I note the Chairman of the committee is present and the Vice Chairman was present up to a moment ago. We had the good fortune to visit Youghalarra national school. That school has converted to heat exchange technology. Effectively, the school has been decarbonised. It is a wonderful project. The school has decarbonised its heating provision and has moved away from oil and gas into using the grid for heat exchange. One challenge put to committee members in the course of our interactions was that schools are finding it hard to use or deploy this technology. Has the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment had any interaction with the Minister for Education and Skills? In other words, has the Minister spoken with himself about this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-12-18T17:10:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister's response. Could a formal engagement be made between the Ministers to put in place some type of service level agreement or memorandum of understanding? Can we develop an understanding for those who are tendering for these projects so that it would be as seamless as possible? Applications would have to measure up to the regulatory framework naturally, but the process should not be overly burdensome in terms of the bureaucracy or bells and whistles that contractors have to go through to roll out these projects at a speedier pace.
