[<p eid="para_85">I welcome the three speakers. It has been quite informative and it is interesting to get their perspectives. I will start with the political-economic element of this. I want to kick the tyres a little bit. I do not think it follows that the direction of travel will be closer to European integration. The Franco-German alliance has been quite strong since the end of the Second World War. It may have been under threat but the election of Macron has settled it. I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath on the veto. The veto still exists and there is very clear, unambiguous messaging about Ireland's position on the veto. There are other smaller countries that potentially have similar positions to ours. It is not just one country on the western periphery setting its face against the 26. There will be other countries as well. The Dutch, the Danes and others might be in a similar position to us. I want to get the witnesses' perspective on it briefly because it is 5.04 p.m. We have until 5.30 p.m. but Deputy Tóibín wants to get in as well. The briefer the answers, the more we can get through. I want to get a sense of the BEPS and OECD process. As far as I am concerned, it is a transparent, open and clear process we have subscribed to as a country. Will the witnesses discuss it?</p>]
[<p eid="para_87">This is dead in the water.</p>]
[<p eid="para_89">What is the position if there is no political willingness, unanimity or treaty change any time soon? My opinion is woe betide any nation that tries to propose a referendum on any changes to the CCCTB or any matter of tax competency in the EU treaties. It would find it quite difficult.</p>]
[<p eid="para_91">I will park it for a second. I just wanted to make the point that I do not think the so-called new paradigm is necessarily a new paradigm. The Irish position is unambiguous. It depends on who is in government at a particular point in time. We will not be presumptuous.</p>, <p eid="para_92"> I want to talk about prudential supervision. Does Mr. Pat Lardner or Mr. Marc Coleman know how many new authorisations have been granted by the Central Bank across financial services in the past six or 12 months?</p>]
[<p eid="para_94">Is that as a result of the IDA strategy of going out and winning the business or because of corporate decisions?</p>]
[<p eid="para_96">Do we know how many changes there have been to existing operations in terms of new authorisations? There is an authorisation for a very specific activity. If one wants to change that activity they have to seek a change to the authorisation.</p>]
[<p eid="para_98">I am aware of that but I just wanted to get a perspective from the guys who are at the coalface of the industry.</p>]
[<p eid="para_100">I am asking because if the authorisation is changed it could change the type of activity. It could have an impact on the types of jobs whether they are front of house or back office.</p>]
[<p eid="para_103">In fairness to Mr. Coleman, he referred to FinTech earlier. That has the potential to be a game-changer around how business is done. This leads me then to seek a perspective from the witnesses on the existence of the European supervisory authorities, the Single Supervisory Mechanism for instance. If a company in the UK is thinking of moving outside of the City of London for instance, and I do not confine that to a geographical space but rather the City of London as we know it, and is thinking of moving to Dublin, it presumably still has to subscribe to those rules and adhere to those two regulatory mechanisms.</p>, <p eid="para_104"> I put it to the witnesses that the decision to locate in Dublin is a marginal call. It is a competition between Dublin, Paris, anywhere in Switzerland or effectively anywhere across Europe. The decision to move to Ireland may not necessarily be predicated only on the skill-set. I have worked in banking myself and anyone smart can be trained within a short eight-week window. There is not necessarily a need for a long apprenticeship; anybody can be trained in any country with the right type of approach. My point is that the call to move to Dublin could be predicated on quality of life indicators as much as regulatory or prudential supervisory ones. There is no certainty about this whatsoever, we are still in a nebulous space because the political negotiations are nowhere near getting down into the nitty-gritty yet. If we are talking about winning jobs post-Brexit, however, the decision to move to Dublin would not necessarily be predicated on the financial culture but more on the following question: can my employees live, work and exist in this city? That is as much a decision on the call to move here as anything else.</p>]
[<p eid="para_107">I am conscious of time so-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_109">Being deliberately parochial here, I suggest to Dr. Regan that an IDA Ireland strategy for those kinds of wins does not have to be centred on Dublin. It can be centred on Limerick or Cork if we are talking about quality of life indicators, because the technology allows for it now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_167">I will be brief, as I am under time constraints, so I apologise in advance. I welcome the submission. Were we seeking the Central Bank's state of play in the context of what is still arguably a nebulous process in terms of the politics of Brexit and the negotiations therein, this would be a good one.</p>, <p eid="para_168"> I will ask a simple question to seek a better understanding of the nature of authorisations. Mr. Sibley referred to "currently authorised firms that are considering changes to existing operations and those that are considering seeking entirely new authorisations". Will he give us a brief sense of what that means in real terms? What types of changes to those authorisations and new authorisations are being discussed? Will he break them down by sector? Do they relate to banks, fund managers, financial services and so on?</p>]
[<p eid="para_170">That makes sense.</p>]
