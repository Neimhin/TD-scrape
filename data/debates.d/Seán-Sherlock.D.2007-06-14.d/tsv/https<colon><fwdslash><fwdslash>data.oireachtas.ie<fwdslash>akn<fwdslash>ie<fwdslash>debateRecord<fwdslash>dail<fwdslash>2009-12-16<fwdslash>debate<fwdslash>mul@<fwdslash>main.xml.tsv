SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	——-I believe we need to start slaughtering a few sacred cows in this great Republic of ours.  When somebody in the public service has to incur a cut of €1, 500 in his or her salary and a member of the Judiciary is exempt by virtue of a constitutional arrangement, that speaks volumes about the nature of the society in the Republic.  If Ireland, as a republic, is to treat and cherish everybody equally, and if we subscribe to the French principles of liberté, égalité and fraternité of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware, then we should have no qualms in these troubling times about reducing the salaries of the members of the Judiciary. I believe we are unduly deferential to people who hold such positions.  While we are respectful of the role they have and of the constitutional arrangements as regards the separation of powers, I do not believe they should be exempted from such cuts by virtue of a legal advice that has been given to the Government.  We rely too much on such legal advice matters and hold them in too great a stock, because sometimes they supersede what is fair and equitable in terms of how the common man or woman might perceive such questions.  I gladly support the amendment that has been tabled on the basis of it being equitable and right for this country at this time.
