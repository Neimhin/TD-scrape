SeanSherlock	Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)	None	I hope I can respond positively to all the ideas that were put forward.  I acknowledge the contribution by Members to the debate on the past two evenings.  Members have been generally constructive in their comments to date.I wish to put on record press releases from the IDA which outline certain examples of foreign direct investments made in the past two weeks.  On 26 September the headline read "Twitter to establish international office in Ireland".  On 22 September, the headline read "MSD opens new €100m R&D centre in Tipperary".  On 21 September the headline read "arvato Finance marks 15 year anniversary with ambitious growth plans".  On 20 September the headline read "Pfizer invests €200m in its Grange Castle biotech site".  On 20 September the headline read "HCL Technologies establishes Software Delivery Centre in Dublin".  On 16 September the headline read "The Coca-Cola Company opens new manufacturing and innovation facility in Wexford."  I only put those on the record because they are examples of success in attracting foreign direct investment.As Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, we are currently engaged in a research prioritisation exercise.  The purpose of the exercise is to narrow down key elements of areas of research so we can continue to attract that kind of FDI in order that we can ensure we have a platform for the basic research and applied research and that the level of collaboration between industry and academia is deepened so we can ensure we can continue on that platform and to put us even higher up the global rankings in research and innovation.   No party or Government should claim for itself this evolutionary process which has been put in place since 1996 by various parties.  It is only successful because of the fact that we have organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Science Foundation Ireland and Forfás which have the level of expertise to pitch to a market and attract the type of companies we need.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I apologise to Opposition Members because my time is limited and I would like to respond.  Since July, some 1,400 people have signed up to the jobs initiative and the national internship scheme.  It will not be a panacea but it is making incremental progress.  That is how the Government will proceed.  We will not have a great leap forward within the next thee or four months because we must still address a deficit issue which has been acknowledged by all sides of the House.  There will be differences over the manner in which we continue to address the deficit, but we still have that restraint in terms of our public finances which hampers one's ability to concentrate solely on stimulus.  It will be a mix of stimulus and retrenchment, which is the reality of the situation.  I will not blame past Governments but will rather look forward to our FDI and strong export sector.My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, will soon be receiving the first draft report of the small business advisory group.  He announced today that county enterprise boards will get another €3.1 million.  These are all initiatives which locally and nationally will create the type of stimulus we need.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	It is a slow, incremental process but our hearts and minds are in the right place.  If I am to engage in a bit of rhetoric along with some of my counterparts in opposition, I would say that to govern is to choose.  That means we will have to make tough decisions in future, but at the same time we are trying to keep the basics right.I would like to address the habitats directive and farming, as Deputies have referred to them.  The "Food Harvest 2020" document has been bought into by all stakeholders involved in the rural economy, including the co-operative movement and farming organisations.  We will see tangible growth in that area, but the challenge is whether it will be jobless growth.  I acknowledge we must be cognisant of that also.Flooding was referred to and the Deputy mentioned his inability to get information on the habitats directive.  However, not one Deputy in the Technical Group has ever approached me as a Minister to ask for any kind of briefing on the area I represent, which is a foundation for the growth we are talking about.  Like other Ministers, my door is open to any Member of the House in order to engage with them constructively on any aspect.  Let us do away with the rhetoric that has filled the air for a long time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	We will work together constructively with those on the Opposition benches.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I extend the invitation.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	None	I extend the invitation to Opposition Members to engage with us on a personal level and we will do everything we can to bring their agenda to the House.
