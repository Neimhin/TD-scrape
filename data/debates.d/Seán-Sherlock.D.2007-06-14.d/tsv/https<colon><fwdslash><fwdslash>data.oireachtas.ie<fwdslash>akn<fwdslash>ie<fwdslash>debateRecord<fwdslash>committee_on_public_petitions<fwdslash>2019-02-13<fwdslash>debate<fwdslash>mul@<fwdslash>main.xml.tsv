[<p eid="para_8">As we have a quorum, we are in public session.</p>]
[<p eid="para_9">The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00047/18. It seeks the organisation of an all-Ireland citizens' assembly to negotiate and agree the basic structure of an independent 32-county Ireland, and to negotiate an all-Ireland referendum on Irish unity. The decision of the committee is to propose to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition. Before we make a decision, I will open it up to the floor for members to make a submission on the issue.</p>]
[<p eid="para_12">I thank Deputy Tóbín.</p>]
[<p eid="para_14">I thank Deputy Mitchell.</p>]
[<p eid="para_20">Cork.</p>]
[<p eid="para_25">I thank Deputy Cassells. I invite Senator Buttimer to contribute.</p>]
[<p eid="para_29">I am not opening up a big debate, Deputy Tóibín. I am telling you now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_31">No, not even a small debate, and I will be very clear and succinct. There are other fora to debate the nature and extent-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_33">That is not the fault of this committee. I suggest that this is not the time for that and there are other more appropriate fora. That is a ruling I am going to make, Deputy, but please do intervene, if you want to - for a short time. We are not doing political football now. I can tell you that now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">No, but this is your second intervention.</p>]
[<p eid="para_37">No, I am making a ruling now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_39">No, I am making a ruling now. I am very amenable as a Chairman and the members present will attest to that. I am not opening up a discussion or a political debate on the future of the island. The committee has already made a determination in respect of-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_41">The committee is about to make a determination, and I am asking the committee now-----</p>]
[<p eid="para_43">I do not want to be rude either. I am making a ruling now.</p>]
[<p eid="para_45">I am not giving the Deputy any more oxygen. I am asking the Deputy to obey the Chair.</p>]
[<p eid="para_47">I propose that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition. Before I ask for agreement on that, I want to state that the petition was deemed to be premature on the basis that the petition clearly said, "The Irish people must decide on their own future instead of awaiting a Border poll from a nation that has blatantly dismissed their grievances and sentiments". There is very clear language in the Good Friday Agreement in respect of the Border poll which we have all signed up to. We are all republicans, so we all have a perspective on the future of the island and there is a lot more common ground on that than people might think. Is it agreed that we would forward a copy of the response from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the petitioner and close the petition? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_48"> The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00220/19 from Ms Laura Hackett. The petition concerns the well-being of breeding dogs in Ireland. The proposal is that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the revised guidelines to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">I thank the Senator. Is that agreed? Agreed. The final petition for consideration is petition No. P00049/2018 which is from Mr. Mark O'Hagan. I propose that we deem the petition inadmissible in accordance with Standing Order 111C(1)(<i>d</i>). Is that agreed? Agreed. I thank members for their attendance.</p>]
