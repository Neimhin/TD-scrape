SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	I wish to come back to financing and scalability, which are the two elements to this that I can discern. If questions about finance have already been asked and answered-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	How can we get banks and credit unions to finance this opportunity for people living in typical 1970s bungalows? Such people might have some savings and can benefit from the SEAI grant. However, they still fall short of the a cost of a deep retrofit or a better energy solution. How do we fill that final piece of the pie? I have not been able to figure that out. The credit union movement and the Irish League of Credit Unions have talking about getting into this space. I imagine the banks could not care less about this space. However, relatively small loans could be scaled up to achieve a lot.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	That is the first question.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	Yes, please.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	I appreciate that. There is more work to be done around financing but at least we can take some empirical models from the SEAI research. I welcome Mr. Tom Parlon back to the House, if that has not been done already. I am sure it has. I refer to Part L of the building regulations and the skill set needed for retrofitting. A finite pool of labour is available for construction in Ireland at present but that is going to ramp up. I have a two-part question. First, how will the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others train the type of people the Tipperary Energy Agency is supplying in order to meet the demand? 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	As I said at the outset, for efficiency's sake if my questions have been answered already the witnesses need not answer them. The second question concerns Part L of the building regulations. We have discussed nearly zero energy buildings. What is the energy fit in these buildings? Is it boilers, advanced boilers or heat exchangers? What is the CIF's interpretation of Part L for new builds? My fear is that solar and heat exchangers might not be part of it. Is there any thinking within CIF on that? 
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2019-07-10T15:40:00+01:00	That is the challenge. We are now going to load the grid. We will effectively use fossil fuels to add more power to the grid to meet the targets from a building perspective. At the same time, there will be an exponential increase in the amount of fossil fuel we use to keep the grid going. I am playing devil's advocate now-----
