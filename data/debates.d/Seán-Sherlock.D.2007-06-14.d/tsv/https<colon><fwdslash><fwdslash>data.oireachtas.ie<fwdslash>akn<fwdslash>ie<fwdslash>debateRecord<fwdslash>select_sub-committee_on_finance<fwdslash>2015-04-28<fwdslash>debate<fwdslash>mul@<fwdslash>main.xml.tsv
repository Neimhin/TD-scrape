Section 2 is the interpretation section of the Bill and provides for the definitions. Amendment No. 1 is to provide a definition of "duties of customs", which is used throughout the Bill. The definition will ensure that the phrase will have the same meaning in the Bill as it has in the EU customs legislation. Amendment No. 2 deletes the definition of "other Member States", which on an analysis of the Bill following its publication, was found to be no longer needed. Amendment No. 3 amends the current definition of "officer of customs" in the Bill as published. The purpose of the amendment is to widen the inclusion text to provide for the inclusion in the definition of "officer of customs" of an officer of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>]

[<p eid="para_29">Before responding to Deputy Tóibín's question, I will address amendments Nos. 6 and 7. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 tabled by Deputy Doherty are to section 6, which provides that the Revenue Commissioners may appoint, for the purposes of the Customs Acts, any place in the State as a customs port or a customs airport for the arrival and departure of vessels and aircraft into or out of the State.</p>, <p eid="para_30"> The effect of the amendments, if accepted, would be to place in section 6 a legal requirement on the Minister for Finance to make regulations as to how controls of vessels and aircraft are to be applied to foreign military naval craft and foreign military aircraft, respectively, which land in the State. At present section 6 does not contain provisions relating to the control of either vessels or aircraft arriving into or departing from the State. Therefore, the two amendments are not relevant to the section.</p>, <p eid="para_31"> Provisions relating to the control of vessels and aircraft are, however, contained in sections 8 to 11, inclusive. It is the intention that the Revenue Commissioners will make regulations under these sections specifying the arrangements that will apply to different types and classes of vessels and aircraft arriving in or departing the State. Under section 39, regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners regarding, <i>inter alia</i>, the procedures relating to conveyances, including vessels and aircraft, are to be laid before the Dáil.</p>, <p eid="para_32"> However, on the substantive point in both amendments, namely, the controls that are to be applied to foreign military naval craft and foreign military aircraft which land in the State, such aircraft or vessels are not liable to inspection or search due to internationally accepted principle and customary law on sovereign immunity. Essentially, there is no right in international law for any state's military aircraft to enter the sovereign airspace of another state nor is there a right of naval vessels to enter the territorial waters of another state. Entry requires the consent of the state concerned and, of course, there is no obligation to grant it. However, once granted, the vessel or aircraft concerned enjoys sovereign immunity from the jurisdiction of the consenting state and if it violates any conditions attached to that consent, the only remedy available to the consenting state is to require it to leave its waters or airspace. </p>, <p eid="para_33"> As the proposed amendments would impinge upon internationally agreed principles and customs law, the Government cannot accept these amendments.</p>]
[<p eid="para_35">This is the Customs Bill 2014.</p>, <p eid="para_36">If the Deputy wishes to bring forward a Bill or an amendment to other legislation to address the issues outlined by him there are appropriate ways of doing so. The Government is not in a position to accept these two amendments because, as I have stated, this is a customs Bill. Permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish airports is subject to policy conditions, including that the aircraft carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of any military exercise or operation.</p>, <p eid="para_37"> As I said, this is a customs Bill. Arguably, it is a consolidation of legislation dating back to the 1800s in relation to the issue of customs. There is a more appropriate mechanism available through which the Deputy can address the issues he raised.</p>]
[<p eid="para_39">For clarity, in regard to civil aircraft, An Garda Síochána has statutory powers of entry and arrest. However, these powers can only be exercised where a garda knows or reasonably suspects that a person has committed an offence. There is no legislative basis to permit random or routine entry to or a search of civilian aircraft for the purpose of the detection of any offence. Amendments to these legislative provisions are the responsibility of the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Day-to-day implementation of these provisions is an operational matter for An Garda Síochána.</p>, <p eid="para_40"> The Deputy has spoken specifically of military aircraft. The situation in this regard is different. Under the Chicago Convention, which provides the basis for the regulation of international civil aviation, military aircraft are deemed to be state aircraft and are excluded from the application of that convention. Accordingly, section 3 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946 excludes state aircraft from its provisions. This is subject to the wider provisions of the Chicago Convention. Again, for the purposes of this legislation, which is a customs Bill, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>]

Amendment No. 12, also to section 10, concerns the obligations of the pilot in command of an aircraft entering into or departing from the State.

Amendment No. 13 makes a corresponding change to section 11, which provides that the pilot in command of an aircraft arriving at, or departing from, the State is required to deliver a report as outlined earlier. The amendment also provides that the revised text does not constitute any change of substance to the requirement in the original text as published.</p>]

The amendment in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) is to provide that a person entering or leaving the State shall also answer any questions put to him or her by an officer of customs in respect of the person’s identity, place of residence and address within the State.

[<p eid="para_109">Amendment No.15, in the name of Deputy Doherty, is to section 12. The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be that any person either searched or found to be liable for duty or tax on imported goods could request in writing the reason that he or she had been searched or the reason he or she had been charged the duty or tax.</p>, <p eid="para_110"> The charging of any duty or tax on imported goods only arises where such goods are so liable under the law in force at the time. Information regarding rates of duty and tax applicable is freely and widely available, for example, on the Revenue Commissioners' website and in public notices. Any assessment to duty or tax made by customs would be fully explained to the person concerned at the time of importation or at any subsequent time, if so requested. Accordingly, it is considered that a provision in legislation, as laid down in the amendment, is absolutely unnecessary.</p>, <p eid="para_111"> As regards the search of baggage, the selection of baggage for examination is based on a combination of customs risk assessment criteria, intelligence information and an element of random selection. Search of passengers’ baggage by customs is a standard control mechanism at ports and airports worldwide and it is not considered necessary or desirable from an operational point of view to disclose to the passenger the reason his or her baggage was selected for examination.</p>]

[<p eid="para_139">Section 22 provides that in civil or criminal cases where judgment is given against a Revenue official as the defendant on account of the seizing or detention of anything, the plaintiff will not be entitled to any damages or costs and the defendant will not be liable to punishment or penalty, providing the court finds probable cause for the seizure or detention. No change of substance is involved. This section protects officers seizing or detaining goods or anything where a civil or criminal case is taken against such officers, provided that the court or judge certifies that there was probable cause for such seizure or detention.</p>, <p eid="para_140">This provision mirrors a similar provision, namely, section 129 of the Finance Act 2001, in respect of the seizure of exciseable goods. It is considered that this is a reasonable safeguard for customs officers when carrying out their official duties and acting in good faith. From the plaintiff’s point of view, he or she has the safeguard that the court must find that there was probable cause for the detention or seizure. If the section were not included, customs officers would be unable to carry out their official duties for fear of exposing themselves to threats of vexatious litigation. Forgive me for not understanding the question posed. Perhaps the Deputy can pose it again.</p>]
[<p eid="para_142">Customs officers, when they have probable cause for detention or seizure, must be protected when enforcing the law. This type of protection has existed for customs officials this since the early days of customs law and also exists for other officials of the State enforcing law. For example, Revenue officials enforcing excise law have had this protection since the early days of excise and it was renewed in the 2001 Finance Act. If the court or judge fails to find that the customs official had any probable cause for detention or seizure, the section does not provide any protection and the owner or holder of the goods seized can, if they so wish, seek compensation through the courts.</p>]

[<p eid="para_162">In general terms, the Deputy referred to being citizen-friendly and it is important we recognise the work of customs officials is citizen-friendly. If fines are issued successfully, it is because there has been a breach of regulations. We all subscribe to the rule of law in that context.</p>, <p eid="para_163"> I will explain to the Deputy the Government's position and the Deputy can explain why he seeks a return to a District Court judge and give us some insight into the Sinn Féin position on this. The amendment gives a customs officer, on reasonable grounds of suspicion, the power to detain goods and conveyances being imported or exported pending the outcome of inquiries and investigations into whether the goods in question are in compliance with the Customs Acts. Section 33(4) provides that a customs officer may detain any goods being imported or exported that he or she has reasonable grounds to suspect might be required as evidence in any criminal proceedings under any enactment other than the Customs Acts and to place such goods in the custody of the Garda Síochána or other appropriate authority for the purpose of such proceedings. Section 33(4) is a new power and is being proposed to cover instances where Customs and Excise officers, in the course of their duties, discover items that, while not in contravention of customs law, could be required as evidence in criminal proceedings involving breaches of other laws. An example would be false passports discovered in a postal consignment. These would not be in contravention of any customs laws but would clearly be evidence of wrongdoing under other legislation and could be required as evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>, <p eid="para_164"> The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be to limit the period of detention of such goods to 30 days and, after each period of 30 days, to require the officer to seek permission from a District Court judge to continue to hold the goods. It is considered that a determination as to whether goods detained under this provision are required as evidence in proceedings would, in the vast majority of cases, be made without undue delay and certainly within the 30-day period proposed in the amendment. However, it would be restrictive and time-consuming to lay down in legislation a requirement to return to the courts on one or more occasions while inquiries were ongoing. On this basis, I do not accept the amendment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_166">If the Deputy examines the Bill, section 33(3) includes the provision that if, within 30 days of the detaining goods, the customs officials do not have any good reasons to seize the goods, they must be released. Other provisions are included in the paragraph the Deputy wants to amend, section 33(4), which are for cases where other goods, which may be evidence in criminal proceedings, are detained. These goods will be handed on to the custody of the Garda Síochána as soon as possible. The goods will no longer be in possession of the customs authorities. In the first case, the customs authorities either release or seize within 30 days and in the second case the Garda Síochána has custody of the goods.</p>]
[<p eid="para_172">To be helpful to the Deputy, perhaps we need to distinguish between what is a customs issue, in effect, and what is an excise issue. If this amendment were accepted, its effect would be to introduce a new section in the Bill under which the Minister for Finance would be statutorily obliged to "lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effect of fuel, tobacco and other types of smuggling on the economy and propose in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Assembly measures to tackle these crimes.". The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners monitor the illicit trade in excisable goods on an ongoing basis and continually make recommendations to tackle the issue. The Minister has used successive Finance Acts to introduce measures to tackle the illicit trade in fuel and tobacco and will not hesitate to do so again in this year's finance Bill, if he sees a need to do so. I hope any such measures will gain the support of all parties.</p>, <p eid="para_173"> Three reports in this field have already been completed this year. The Revenue Commissioners recently published an analysis of oil duties, entitled The Oil Market in Ireland: Duties, Prices and Consumption. This report included an examination of consumption and revenue loss to the Exchequer due to laundering and smuggling. This report indicates that the overall strategy being pursued by Revenue to combat fuel laundering is working.</p>, <p eid="para_174"> A report recently published by a committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, entitled Cross-border Police Cooperation and Illicit Trade, found that "the current level of cooperation between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI was excellent with evidence that both police forces worked closely together, formally and informally, on many issues".
