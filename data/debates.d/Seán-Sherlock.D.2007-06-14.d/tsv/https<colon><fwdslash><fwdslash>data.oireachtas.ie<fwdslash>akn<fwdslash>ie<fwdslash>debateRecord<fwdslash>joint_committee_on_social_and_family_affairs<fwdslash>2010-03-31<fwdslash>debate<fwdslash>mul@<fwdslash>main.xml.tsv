[<p eid="para_55">I apologise for missing the submissions as I was attending a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The issue is one of equity.  It also speaks to the fact of how women are treated <i>vis-Ã -vis</i> the pensions system as a whole in this country.  The issue is very simple in that if the terms of a scheme are agreed, people buy into the scheme in good faith and the bona fides of the scheme are clearly established, as a matter of equity and fairness it is necessary that the obligations of the scheme are met.  These women signed up to the scheme in good faith and the State should honour its commitments in that regard.  There is also the wider issue of the treatment of women who are atypical workers, if I can use that phrase, and how we are to deal with their pensions provision into the future.  I welcome the submissions.  I have been in touch with the IFA on the issue and welcome the fact it is represented here today.</p>]
