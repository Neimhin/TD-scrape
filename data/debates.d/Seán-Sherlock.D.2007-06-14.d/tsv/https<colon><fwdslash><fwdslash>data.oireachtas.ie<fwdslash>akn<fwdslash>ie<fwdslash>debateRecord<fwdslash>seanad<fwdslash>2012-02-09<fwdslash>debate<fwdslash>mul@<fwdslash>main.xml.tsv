[<p eid="para_501">I thank Senators Power and Zappone for raising this matter.  As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has said, he extends his apologies that he is unable to be present, therefore I speak on his behalf.</p>, <p eid="para_502">Before commenting on Sweden's legislative model which criminalises the purchase of sexual services I  wish to outline the legislative measures in place to tackle the phenomena of human trafficking and organised prostitution.  Ireland has strong legislation to combat the scourge of human trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 gave effect to Ireland's obligations in various international instruments to criminalise human trafficking.  The trafficking of persons for sexual exploitation, including prostitution, is a criminal offence and those convicted of such trafficking are liable to life imprisonment.  In addition, it is an offence under the legislation for any person to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.</p>, <p eid="para_503">In the case of prostitution legislation, there are a number of offences directly aimed at protecting prostitutes from exploitation.  Under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993, it is an offence to organise prostitution, coerce or compel a person to be a prostitute, knowingly live off the earnings of a prostitute, or keep or manage a brothel.  In addition, the solicitation offence in the legislation is targeted at buyers, sellers and third parties, such as pimps.  Buyers as well as sellers are liable to prosecution and the same penalties apply.</p>, <p eid="para_504">The 1993 Act, as amended, provides that a person who solicits or importunes a child — whether or not for the purposes of prostitution — to commit an act which would constitute carnal knowledge or sexual assault is guilty of an offence.  Moreover, in addition to being charged with such solicitation, a person who engages in a sexual act with the child could be charged with serious offences under sexual offences legislation.  In these circumstances, consent to the sexual act is not a defence.  Strong as the law is, there is always room for improvement and the law on prostitution is being reviewed with a view to enhancing the protection of vulnerable persons.</p>, <p eid="para_505">I should add that the law is being enforced.  An Garda Síochána continually targets the individuals and criminal groups involved in prostitution and related activities.  A number of individuals and criminal groups have been identified, arrested, prosecuted and convicted.  The Garda carries out targeted operations to address crime in regard to prostitution, and these often encompass situations where it is suspected that women and girls have been trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation.  This includes monitoring of websites associated with the advertising of prostitution, targeting the activities of criminal groups involved in organised prostitution, brothel keeping and money laundering offences.  Given the involvement of organised crime gangs, such operations may be supported by specialist assistance provided by units such as the Criminal Assets Bureau the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p>, <p eid="para_506">As part of the review I mentioned earlier, the Minister announced in October that he would be arranging a consultation process on the future direction of prostitution legislation.  A detailed discussion document to facilitate the consultation process is being prepared.  It will be appreciated that the discussion document, if it is to fully inform the public, needs to be prepared carefully.  It is expected that the document will be ready in the coming weeks.</p>, <p eid="para_507">The Senators have asked for clarification as to whether it is the Government's intention to change Ireland's laws on prostitution to bring them into line with the Swedish approach, as advocated by the Turn off the Red Light coalition.  The Government has not made any decision in this matter.  When the review, including public consultation, is concluded, the Minister will bring any legislative proposals to Government in the normal way.</p>, <p eid="para_508">While no decisions have been taken with regard to legislative proposals, it is important to point out, as was already indicated in the Seanad debate last October, that any proposal to criminalise the purchase of sex within our legal framework raises complex issues.  A provision in the substantially different constitutional framework of one jurisdiction cannot be simply transposed into another jurisdiction's constitutional and legal framework.</p>, <p eid="para_509">The Minister does not wish to appear to be dismissing the Swedish model out of hand.  All options will be considered but it is important to mention that there are issues which require in-depth examination.  The Swedish offence of purchasing sexual services would appear to be a strict liability offence.  There are difficulties in this jurisdiction in establishing offences of strict and absolute liability arising from the Supreme Court decision in the CC case.  If the Swedish approach were adopted here, one party only to a two-way transaction between consenting adults would be guilty of an offence.  The buyer only would be culpable and subject to penalty, with all that entails.  The buyer would have no defence in law and the seller would not commit any offence in respect of the receipt of a consideration for sexual services.  Criminalising one party only in this manner, were it not clearly justifiable on objective grounds, could be open to constitutional challenge.</p>, <p eid="para_510">There would obviously be concerns too, at criminalising the sale of sex by exploited persons.  In addition to legal concerns, there are different and genuinely held views on this matter.  The Minister does not believe that the introduction of a Swedish style ban could be advanced here without a considered public debate.</p>, <p eid="para_511">This is an issue which affects individuals and communities.  It is also a societal issue.  Public debate should be open to the widest possible audience and the Minister wants to ensure that everyone who wishes to make a contribution to this important debate is given the opportunity to do so.  That is the reason the Minister has decided on a consultation process before charting the way ahead.</p>, <p eid="para_512">I would like to thank the Senators for raising this issue today.  The Minister would like to reiterate that everything that can reasonably be done to combat prostitution will be done, and he looks forward to the outcome of the consultation process, which is expected to get under way shortly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_516">We must have due regard to what Senators Power and Zappone are saying.  If such a statement was made in October 2011 and if they justifiably feel that no progress has been made on that issue, then I would like to assure them that I will speak to the Minister and that we need to make haste on it.  I genuinely have regard to the statements that have been made.</p>, <p eid="para_517">As this is a cross-bench issue and affects all of us as a society, I hope that the Senators' views would have a major influence in the process and I hope that the Department would take seriously the views that have been expressed here today.  I will talk directly with the Minister and try to move the process along.</p>]
[<p eid="para_524">I am glad that both Senators have raised the issue.  The last point made was about the over-dependence on the construction industry.  That is part of the structural difficulty which exists in many of the regions outside of the larger urban conurbations, where the labour force moved into the construction industry.</p>, <p eid="para_525">When the construction industry fell apart, all of a sudden there were massive rates of unemployment.  The south east, in particular, has seen its unemployment rate jump from 4.9% in 2007 — which was marginally above the countrywide average of 4.6% — to 18.2%, compared with a national average of 14.3%.  There is a clear acknowledgement of the difficulties facing the south east.  I will be frank and say that neither of the two Senators have proffered any solutions.  We must acknowledge that State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as local authorities, academic institutions and enterprise boards, will have to be part of a plan to stem that tide of unemployment and reverse the trend.</p>, <p eid="para_526">The south-east action plan contains specific actions to address the unemployment problems affecting the south east.  The plan, which is geographically oriented towards that area, was launched more than two months ago, on 2 December.  Its intention is to provide for regular meetings with a forum representing the agencies and local stakeholders to progress its implementation.</p>, <p eid="para_527">The structural challenges faced by the south east region have built up over many years and will not be reversed by a simple set of actions.  What is required is to build a stronger local enterprise base in the region as a whole.  The report identifies many actions that can help deliver on that ambition, but it will only achieve so much.  The Senators will acknowledge that we cannot reverse the unemployment trend overnight.  There will need to be structural changes and investments in key areas in order to stem that tide.  There are challenges for all agencies to build up the region's competitive advantage and then promote it in a co-ordinated manner.</p>, <p eid="para_528">One of the key issues that no single agency or Department can hope to address is the issue of the overall coherence of the region's value proposition to investors from home or abroad.  What has arisen again and again in consultation with all the relevant stakeholders and agencies in the region is the need for greater co-ordination of effort from all those with an interest in improving the enterprise potential of the region.  This was brought to the fore when the agencies, local authorities, CEBs, educational institutions and other local representative groups met with the Minister on 24 November last.  That meeting was the first time a group of that nature had met with a focus solely on what could be done to improve the region's fortunes, which is worth noting.  We must also bear in mind that the figures quoted by Senator Cullinane are from a time when a different political entity was at the helm.  In all fairness, what this Government has done is to seek to meet the challenges faced by the south east head-on, in partnership with the State agencies.  I understand the Senator will want to score a point off me, as Minister of State, but he should recognise that people across party political boundaries want to work together to stem the tide of unemployment.</p>]
[<p eid="para_530">The Minister intends in the coming year to facilitate a series of further meetings of that same group as a means of monitoring the implementation of the proposals in this report and also to forge greater co-operation and collaboration between the various stakeholders across the region.  I hope Senator Cullinane will get on board with that process.</p>]
[<p eid="para_533">It is not just a matter of identifying a set of metrics from 2007 to 2010.  We need to consider the problem from a qualitative point of view.  We cannot just extrapolate from the rate of investment by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland and say that in monetary terms, the south east has not benefited, because other regions have the same claim, in real terms.  We can say that the larger urban areas such as Cork, Dublin and Galway have a disproportionately high rate of inward investment in the form of IDA projects, but we also need to consider human capital, soft skills and the relationships among stakeholders.  There is now a model, sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to deal with this.  It is not that I am being defensive.  If we are debating an issue, we need to set out the parameters for that debate.  We must have due regard to the fact that all of the stakeholders want to drive this on.  In fairness to all political entities, they also want to drive this on.  If it needs to be critiqued, we are open to that.  However, it is not just a question of investment by the IDA, although that is one aspect of it.  It is a question, also, of ensuring that we can deliver on education.  Senator Cullinane will be aware of my commitment to the Telecommunications Software &amp; Systems Group, TSSG, which is, as far as I am concerned, a beacon for the region.  We need to mine more of that intellectual development and human capital.  Inch by inch, that is what will restore the region so that we have a level playing field.  I have listened to the points that were made.  We are not going to be complacent about this.  We have a job to do.</p>]
[<p eid="para_535">Yes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_541">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  It is recognised that international ranking systems are referenced by international investors, employers and students and consequently they cannot be ignored.  However, it should also be noted that these systems are not infallible and it is widely agreed that they should be interpreted with caution.  We can draw encouragement from the overall performance of the Irish system on the latest Times Higher Education system performance tables which place Ireland firmly in the world's top 20.  We are ranked 17th overall and sixth in the world relative to our GDP.</p>, <p eid="para_542">The focus in Ireland is on sustaining and advancing performance throughout the system as a whole rather than investing in elite institutions.  Earlier last year the Minister, Deputy Quinn, set out his priorities for the development of the higher education system during the next 20 years and endorsed a range of actions to develop the quality of teaching and learning and to ensure the relevance of programme and curriculum design throughout the system.  These actions are focused on improving the overall student experience and improving the quality and employability of Irish graduates.</p>, <p eid="para_543">On 30 January the President of American Chamber of Commerce Ireland joined the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Chairs of the Higher Education Authority, the expert group on future skills needs and ICT Ireland to launch a new action plan to address the high-level ICT skills needs of enterprise in Ireland.  The action plan is available on the Department website.  It was developed in response to a clear message from industry that there are ICT skills shortages and, more important, that jobs can be created if we have the graduates to fill them.  In a highly mobile and global sector such as ICT, inward migration by skilled professionals will always play a key role in meeting the skills needs of companies.  However, boosting the domestic supply of graduates for 21st century jobs is a key objective for the education system.</p>, <p eid="para_544">The action plan, published last week, has been developed during the past 12 months with close collaboration between officials of the Department of Education and Skills, the expert group on future skills needs, the HEA, ICT Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  It sets out short-, medium- and long-term actions with specific time-bound targets to meet the skills gap in the short term while, in tandem, building up the longer term supply of high quality graduates.  This includes the establishment of an ambitious target of doubling the annual output of ICT graduates from 1,000 this year to 2,000 by 2018.</p>, <p eid="para_545">The skills shortages experienced have not arisen overnight and are not unique to Ireland.  There are no quick-fix solutions that will meet all of the shortages overnight.  However, the plan includes steps that will be taken to increase the supply of graduates within the next 12 months.  The key action in this regard is the immediate roll-out of 750 places on 17 new fully funded graduate skills conversion programmes throughout the country.  These programmes have been developed by public and private higher education providers in collaboration with industry partners.  Participants on the programmes will obtain a post graduate qualification in core computing skills at honours degree level and will be offered a work placement with one of the companies involved in the design of the programmes.  Details of all of the new conversion programmes are available on the <i>BlueBrick.ie</i> web portal.  The majority of the programmes will be under way by March and applications can be submitted immediately through the website.</p>]
[<p eid="para_547">I appreciate the points made by Senator Walsh but I do not believe there is a sense of complacency.  The opposite is the case; there is a great sense of urgency and there are sleepless nights in respect of how we should address this problem.  The bottom line is that one can extrapolate from the Times Higher Education system performance tables.  One can delve into the criteria they apply.  Criteria for measuring rankings differ from one set of rankings to another.  There is no sense of complacency.  The data are important and widely reported and when the reports come in we take them seriously.  In fairness our work and that of previous Governments with American Chamber of Commerce Ireland stands up.  When they send signals across the table we sit up and listen, as have previous Governments; if messages come from them we take note.</p>, <p eid="para_548">It is important to realise that there are many Irish people working in US companies who have had long and distinguished careers in those companies.  They are very attuned to their needs as well and they have the ear of Government.  In fairness, traditionally Fianna Fáil Governments have set out this approach and have been a part of the process for the science, technology and innovation programmes.  This is an apolitical area.</p>, <p eid="para_549">With regard to the points made by Senator Walsh, there is a strong sense of the urgency in respect of dealing with the skills shortages.  However, the Senator will acknowledge that there was an over-reliance on construction and many children went into construction studies from second level rather than software engineering or other engineering programmes and one cannot turn around that ship overnight.  It is healthy for the system to have world class researchers coming from abroad.  It causes us to up our game.  I appreciate the points made.  There is no sense of complacency; we are moving rapidly to address the deficit.</p>]
[<p eid="para_560">Iarraim ar an Seanadóir mo leithscéal a ghabháil toisc nach bhfuil Gaeilge líofa agam.  B'fhearr liom leanúint i mBéarla, lena thoil.</p>, <p eid="para_561">This House is aware that, in the context of budget 2012 and the need for the State to achieve economic independence in the coming years, difficult choices had to be made to achieve savings.  To this end, in 2011 all Departments carried out a comprehensive review of expenditure on all budgets and programmes, and proposals to achieve savings were put to Government.  As one of the largest spending Departments, this was also the case in regard to expenditure on education.</p>, <p eid="para_562">In making these difficult decisions, priority was given to protecting resources for front line services as far as possible in the coming years.  For example, the general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level has been maintained and the overall number of special needs assistants and resource teachers will be maintained at current levels.  However, savings had to be made, even against a background of the expected increase in the school going population in the coming years.  One such decision was the abolition, for new students, of the grant paid for student teachers' three week placement in Gaeltacht summer colleges.  Currently, satisfactory attendance at an Irish language course in the Gaeltacht is a compulsory element of the primary initial teacher education, ITE, courses.</p>, <p eid="para_563">In respect of students in the State-funded colleges of education, the Department pays a grant of €637 per student directly to the Gaeltacht summer colleges per three week course.  This is an annual cost of over €700,000, representing moneys that would have to be found elsewhere within the education budget.  The removal of the grant means students will be liable for the cost.</p>, <p eid="para_564">We would all prefer if this choice did not have to be made.  It has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible.  This move brings the primary ITE courses more into line with a number of other types of degree programmes, such as language degrees, where students are required to bear the costs of additional special requirements themselves.  For example, there are modern languages degrees where a stay in a foreign country might be required.</p>, <p eid="para_565">The Senator might wish to note ITE courses are being reconfigured in line with the recommendations of the Department's literacy and numeracy strategy and the Teaching Council's policy on teacher education, and the need to ensure that all primary teachers are competent and confident in their use of the Irish language, especially given its importance in the primary school curriculum.  To this end, we are looking at raising the bar in regard to the Irish leaving certificate entry requirement for teacher education, but the quality of engagement during the Gaeltacht placement also needs to be of a high standard and be more focused on the outcomes required for our teachers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_568">The Senator's point is fair.  I wish I was in a position to be able to tell him we can  reverse this decision but we cannot.  Some 80% of the budget relates to pay.  There are commitments under Croke Park.  I have to be honest and straight with the Senator.  The decision has been made with regard to this budget line.  However, the IT courses will be reconfigured in line with the recommendations.  It is the case that the money is not there.  I do not want to plámás the Senator or give him the usual political platitudes but I must be straight with him and tell him that the money is not there.</p>]
