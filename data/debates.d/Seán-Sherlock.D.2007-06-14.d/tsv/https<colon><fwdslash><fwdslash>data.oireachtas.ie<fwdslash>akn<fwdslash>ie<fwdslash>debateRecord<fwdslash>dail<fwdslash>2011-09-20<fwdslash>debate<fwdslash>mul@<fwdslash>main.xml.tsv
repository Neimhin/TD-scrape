[<p eid="para_690">I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for raising this issue, which provides me with an opportunity to outline some of the ongoing developments in mathematics and science that are most pertinent to the matter she has put forward for debate.  Providing for high quality teaching and learning of mathematics and science is of strategic importance to the State and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue in the House.</p>, <p eid="para_691">As part of the Government's overall strategy to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics in schools, a number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years.  Deputy Murphy referred to the project maths initiative, the aim of which is to change how mathematics is taught and learned in post-primary schools.  Its purpose is to show how mathematics connects with real life problems and how skills developed in the subject can be used in other subjects, the workplace and at home.  It also aims to change attitudes to mathematics and encourage more students to take the subject at higher level in their examinations and study mathematics and mathematics related subjects in college.</p>, <p eid="para_692">The Government is committed to the full roll-out of project maths, which is supported by industry, colleges and universities.  The roll-out of the programme is supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for all teachers of mathematics.  By the end of 2012, teachers will have been offered six workshops, and a range of supplementary evening courses and teaching resources has been made available.  A bonus points system for mathematics for third level entry has also been introduced on a trial basis.</p>, <p eid="para_693">The Teaching Council, about which questions have been raised in certain quarters, is an independent body which operates at arm's length to the Department.  The council sets standards for teacher qualifications across the curriculum.  It was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 to promote the professional development of teachers and regulate standards in the profession.</p>, <p eid="para_694">Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, the council shall "review the standards of education and training appropriate to a person entering a programme of teacher education and training" and "review the standards of knowledge, skill and competence required for the practice of teaching and shall advise the Minister".  To be registered as a teacher of mathematics with the Teaching Council, a person is required to have a recognised teaching qualification and degree in which mathematics represents at least 30% of the course over at least three years and which qualifies him or her to teach the syllabus to the highest level.  As part of its ongoing remit, the Teaching Council is reviewing the registration criteria for teaching subjects on the post-primary curriculum, including mathematics and science, and will publish its decisions in this regard as soon as they are finalised.  The appointment and deployment of teachers is a matter for individual schools.  Schools have been directed by my Department, as far as practicable, to appoint only appropriately qualified and registered teachers.</p>, <p eid="para_695">The Teaching Council recently carried out the survey of post-primary schools to which the Deputy referred to ascertain the qualifications of mathematics teachers.  I acknowledge the rate of response highlighted by the Deputy.  Preliminary results show 68% of teachers teaching mathematics in 258 schools are fully qualified to do so, 29% have undergone some studies in mathematics and only 2% do not have any third level qualifications or studies in mathematics.  The survey findings will help us obtain a clearer picture of what is happening in schools and allow us to plan to meet training needs.  The schools have until 26 September to respond.</p>, <p eid="para_696">The Department is keen to arrive at a position in which all teachers of mathematics have a qualification in the subject.  It is making arrangements for the provision of a new training programme for mathematics teachers which will provide unqualified mathematics teachers with the opportunity to upskill their knowledge of the subject and study the strategies best suited to the new project maths syllabuses.  Tenders will be invited shortly.</p>]
[<p eid="para_699">We can overcome the challenges facing us notwithstanding the recruitment embargo.  The national centre of excellence in the University of Limerick is doing a great deal of work in the area of continuing professional development to enable teachers to attain the required standard.  In addition, there are conversion courses that can be done.  In this way we can ensure we have a coterie of teachers with the right skill sets to help us to achieve our aims.</p>, <p eid="para_700">The question of how we got to this point is one that would have to be teased out over a longer time period than the two minutes I have.  However, if we are open to the challenge, which we are, we must find out where we need to go.</p>, <p eid="para_701">Deputy Murphy raised valid issues about fragmentation, with which I agree.  We must ensure there is standardisation across the board and that the Teaching Council and the individual boards of management are singing from the same hymn sheet in terms of what we need to achieve.  However, I am confident that the Project Maths initiative, in spite of whatever hiccups it may have along the way, will ensure we can help the students currently achieving E, F and NG grades to move up the scale.  I am less concerned about those currently achieving A, B and C grades.  The introduction of bonus points for maths will facilitate those students who choose not to do honours maths because it is time consuming.  They can devote more time to ordinary level maths and still get a reasonable number of points.</p>, <p eid="para_702">There will be a tender process for training and continuing professional development.  We are engaging with industry and academia in this regard,  but there are challenges.  We will not turn the ship around within the next 12 months.  However, we are engaging with the issue in a deeper fashion than heretofore.  Based on the soundings I have taken outside of the usual advisory groups — I have delved into academia and sought the views of individual teachers — there is a sense that if we stay on track with Project Maths, we can tackle the qualitative and quantitative issues involved in getting grades up.</p>]
[<p eid="para_704">I apologise for not giving Deputy Murphy a more comprehensive answer, but I will be happy to engage further with her on an individual basis.</p>]
