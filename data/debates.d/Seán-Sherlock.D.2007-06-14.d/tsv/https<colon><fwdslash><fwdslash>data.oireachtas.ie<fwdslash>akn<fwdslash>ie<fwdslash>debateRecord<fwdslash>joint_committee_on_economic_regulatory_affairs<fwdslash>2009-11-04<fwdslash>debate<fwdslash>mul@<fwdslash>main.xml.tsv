[<p eid="para_31">I welcome the delegation.  Ms Smith's contribution suggests that there is a difference in approach to the regulation of brokers compared with the banking sector, which is subject to a lighter touch.  What is the solution?  PIBA is seeking one primary codified set of regulations embodied in legislation.  Ms Smith stated, "A primary objective is to collate all applicable legislative requirements and then provide brokers with guidelines to assist them in how best to ensure that they comply with all legislative obligations in their day-to-day business".  Is current regulation weak in general?  Does legislation need to be changed?</p>]
[<p eid="para_34">That is reasonable.  The committee will meet the regulator shortly and we should address this issue with him.</p>]
