SeanSherlock	Deputy Se√°n Sherlock	None	I welcome the submission as a fellow citizen who has a bank account.  It appears those who have genuine complaints against banking organisations have no recourse to mechanisms that would provide a remedy.I am amazed that in response to the question of whether it kept a record or reported on a case for which it claimed it was not responsible, the Financial Regulator stated: "This was not possible in your case because your complaint falls outside the definition of a consumer".  That is an extraordinary scenario.  It would be appropriate for this committee to ask the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator the questions Mr. Beades posed in his conclusion.  We should at least write to them to seek answers to some of these questions.  If we are now in a situation whereby complaints made by individuals are defined as "non-consumer complaints", what recourse is open to anybody who holds a bank account in this State?  If the role of the Financial Regulator and the ombudsman is protecting consumers, it is clear that a flaw exists in the system.  Questions must be answered by these taxpayer funded bodies in regard to the practices of the banking sector.
