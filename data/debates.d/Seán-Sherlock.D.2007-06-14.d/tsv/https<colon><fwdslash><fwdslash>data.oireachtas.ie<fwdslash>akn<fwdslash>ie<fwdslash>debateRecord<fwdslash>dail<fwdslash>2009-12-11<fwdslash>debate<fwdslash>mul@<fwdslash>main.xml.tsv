[<p eid="para_957">That is not what the Minister indicated.</p>]
[<p eid="para_965">I wish to be helpful to the Minister and in no way to appear facetious, but the process was instigated by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias de Rossa.</p>]

[<p eid="para_1182">If those on jobseeker's benefit aged under 24 are residing with their parents, will there be a <i>pro rata </i>cut to reflect the parents’ means?  I have received more and more calls from parents whose sons or daughters recently left college and are living at home.  They have a high dependency on the parental income to give them spending power.  How will they be affected?</p>, <p eid="para_1183">The reduction in income for claimants in this category will have a detrimental effect because the Minister's announcement about additional training places has not been set out in concrete form.  We do not know what shape the places will take or whether a demographic or qualitative study has been conducted as to who in this category would slot into the places.   We do not know how they will slot in or what type of course they will take up.  This is ill thought out.  The overarching philosophy of the Minister was to drive a coach and four through those who most need that marginal income without any thought or lateral view of how this might impact on them.  Will the Minister outline how this cut will affect those people if their parents' income is above a certain level?  I fear for them.  For example, if a parent who works in the public sector has an income up to €40,000 per annum and has a son or daughter who has just graduated, it is most likely that son or daughter is now living at home because he or she cannot get a job.  If that graduate son or daughter cannot find an adequate training place because, as has been stated, he or she is over qualified for the training position, will he or she now be penalised through a reduced payment because of refusing a training place?  What negative effect will this have on their income if they live at home.  These are issues of concern.  In talking about active labour market mechanisms for people who are under the age of 25, the Minister should have thought a little more laterally about putting some well thought out schemes in place before effecting a cut.</p>]

[<p eid="para_1384">On a point of order, if one is shoving somebody——</p>]
[<p eid="para_1726">There are approximately 69,500 people aged under 24 on the live register.  The Minister for Finance claimed in his speech that he will make 26,000 training places available.  Therefore, we cannot force all of those people into training schemes because there are simply not enough places.  Many of those are graduates who will be over qualified for the type of training places I imagine will be envisaged under this proposal.</p>, <p eid="para_1727">We are now in a situation where parents, especially those in the public sector who are in the €30,000-45,000 income bracket and who have seen their incomes reduced, will see a further squeeze on their finances if they have children who have recently graduated living at home who may not fit the type of training schemes that are envisaged.  Under section 3, the Minister has already acknowledged there will be a <i>pro rata</i> decrease, depending on means.  I understand that the minimum amount for which somebody living at home could be eligible is about €30.  That is pocket money and it reduces the dignity of people who qualify from third level education and who continue to live at home.</p>, <p eid="para_1728">There are over 69,000 people aged under 24 on the live register and a significant number of them are graduates who cannot get a job.  The logical conclusion — I say this rationally and without emotion — is that many of the people to whom I refer will be obliged to migrate to some other part of the world to obtain employment.</p>, <p eid="para_1729">In the past ten years, Australia was the new Klondike and it was a good place for people in their early 20s to go.  However, this choice is no longer available because the employment situation in Australia is not as good as previously.  It appears Canada is the new Klondike for many people.  However, employment opportunities there will also soon dry up.  As a result, a significant number of people under the age of 25 will be obliged to reside at home with their parents.  These individuals will be obliged to survive on incomes of €30 or €40 per week and this will place an increased burden on their parents.</p>, <p eid="para_1730">What we needed in the budget was some degree of programming which would ensure that people would not be obliged to take up positions on Mickey Mouse courses in order to maintain their social welfare payments.  The Government should have put in place a proper, well thought out, structured programme of internships.  This would have allowed the people to whom I refer to use the knowledge and qualifications they possess.</p>, <p eid="para_1731">The Minister should think about things in a more lateral fashion.  If she is going to put in place schemes, these should be properly thought out.  People's entitlements should not be cut until they can be given positions on meaningful courses or be provided with internships.  If they are afforded such opportunities, it will assist them in getting back into the workplace.  My party is opposed to this amendment because it will place further hardship on low-paid parents whose sons and daughters under the age of 24 continue to live at home.</p>]
