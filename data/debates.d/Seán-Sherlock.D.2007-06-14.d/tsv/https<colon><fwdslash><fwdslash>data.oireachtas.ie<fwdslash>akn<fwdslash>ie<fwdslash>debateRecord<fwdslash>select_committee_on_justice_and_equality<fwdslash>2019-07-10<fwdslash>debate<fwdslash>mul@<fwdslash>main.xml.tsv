[<p eid="para_35">I, too, welcome the Minister of State's statement on the need for further legislative solutions to the regulation of gambling, particularly in respect of the licensing and registration of casinos. I think all of us in this House would like to see a compendium of legislation that deals with all the issues, particularly online. Mobile technology is now moving at such a pace that regulations in certain areas are soon outmoded by dint of advances in technology. We should therefore take an overarching view.</p>, <p eid="para_36"> I seek clarification on this amendment. I note the Minister of State's comments on the 1956 Act. I would like his confirmation on the following question. Since the Bill does not speak specifically to private members' clubs, could it be said - and I will be guided by the Chairman on this - that one would in effect, by dint of supporting this amendment, be making new law if one were to seek to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act? Nonetheless, I welcome the Minister of State's statement in the round.</p>]
[<p eid="para_76">It was his misspent youth.</p>]
[<p eid="para_81">I welcome the withdrawal of the amendment to allow for a further discussion on this. Three cent to €10 per spin or per game is a significant increase. As legislators, we must consider the exceptions that can be created, no matter what type of figure one puts on the cost per game and the prize money. When legislating for specific figures, no matter what figure one puts in, even if it is low, one must not drive people into other forms of gambling. The advocates from the public health point of view, such as Mr. Barry Grant and Dr. Colin O'Gara, have made a legitimate case in terms of these specific figures. We have listened to them in that regard.</p>]
[<p eid="para_177">It will be a busy summer.</p>]
[<p eid="para_198">If I may, I would like to seek clarification from the proposers of both amendments. Would the effect of the amendments be such that if my neighbour, who is of pensionable age and likes the odd flutter on a Saturday night, and who might purchase a lottery ticket but also likes to go to the bookies to bet on two or three numbers, be prevented from having that flutter? Would this be the effect of both amendments?</p>]
[<p eid="para_202">In effect, the bookies would no longer be allowed to take bets on the outcome of lottery numbers.</p>]
[<p eid="para_219">Before Report Stage, could the Minister of State provide statistics on the opportunity cost of the facility to bet on the Lotto numbers in a bookmaker's? Determining the cost is quite difficult, and possibly insurmountable — I do not know. One would have to go into every single bookmaker's shop in the country and seek to measure the revenue arising from bets on the Lotto numbers on Wednesday and Saturday nights. I am not sure how feasible that is. The Minister of State might have a response to my remark nonetheless.</p>]
