SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T10:10:00+00:00	The articulation of all of this for Deputies like me, who represent both urban and rural constituencies, is that we have villages and townlands that are being split down the middle. The only way I can articulate my point is by giving a practical example and that is the village of Ballyhooly, in north County Cork.Typical of every small village throughout the country, it is quite literally being split down the middle in that part of it is to be provided with broadband through the national broadband plan and the other part is to be provided for by the market. In the case of Ballyhooly, there is a housing estate that quite literally is being split down the middle in this regard. While we accept that the market is providing and that there is an entity called NBI, as public representatives who spend a lot of our time advocating on issues such as access to broadband, particularly in the current climate of remote working, we find it hard to understand why there is not a greater degree of interoperability or connectivity between NBI and the private operators to solve problems and ensure provision of services to people in villages. It is extremely frustrating.  Can Mr. Hendrick provide any reassurance to public representatives like me that people in Ballyhooly and every village like it throughout the country who want to get connected and have a right to be connected will be guaranteed access, that they will not be denied access in the times we live in?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T10:20:00+00:00	I appreciate and understand all of that. When the national broadband plan was rolled out there was an expectation - Mr. Hendrick can tell me if it is not a legitimate expectation - that there would be a more timely intervention in those areas where there are serious gaps. I refer again to Ballyhooly, because as far as I am concerned it is a ground zero for every village of a similar type. There was an expectation that there would be a realisation of the commercial realities, but also a realisation of the corporate social responsibility of ensuring that where there were gaps, right down to micro-level, NBI would be the responsible partner in ensuring that where public representatives like me make representations through our broadband officers in the local authorities or directly to NBI, there would be an understanding of that dynamic and there would be moves to fast-track or, at least, recognise the fact that there are households wherein there are two parents working remotely and a post-primary or third level student who are quite literally taking turns using the broadband such is the lack of capability. Mr. Hendrick speaks about an offering by NBI of minimum speeds of 100 Mbps, a 1G product and a new 2G product. Is NBI guaranteeing those speeds or is it, as set out in the small print, "up to" those speeds. There is a big difference between "up to 1G" and actually guaranteeing 1G. The term "up to" could mean anything up to that level. Those are the issues that we are trying to deal with here and that, as public representatives, we are trying to navigate. We are quite literally reflecting back to NBI what we are hearing on the ground from countless numbers of citizens in the types of villages mentioned, who are deeply frustrated that there is no intervention that appears to be serving them.  Mr. Hendrick is telling me about something that is going to happen in the future, the future is now as far as those people are concerned. The pandemic has fast-tracked remote working and they want results now. What can I tell the people of Ballyhooly arising from my engagement with the witnesses today that would give them some hope that there will be an intervention to meet their needs and they will get a service?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T10:20:00+00:00	Thank you.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:10:00+00:00	It is a nice segue that we are talking about the reliance on external advice. If I understood Mr. Griffin correctly, he is talking about 25 consultants assigned to the roll-out of the national broadband plan. I submitted a parliamentary question for written answer on 19 January of this year asking how much the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications was spending on external consultancy services. The figure I got back was €14.3 million, of which €10.1 million, approximately, was being spent on external services for this very project. If I break that down further - and the reply is a matter of public record - Analysys Mason received €3.9 million, EY business advisory services received €5.3 million and William Fry legal advisory services received €846,000. That adds up to approximately €10.1 million. Is it possible to give a further breakdown of the spend between the three entities I have just mentioned? The reason I ask the question is that I perceive that in latter years Government Departments have been hollowed out and there is an increased dependency on external advice. None of us are against the idea of external advice. It needs to be procured if and when a certain skill set or a specific project needs to be delivered. That is understood. However, €10.1 million seems to me to be an extraordinary figure. What were EY's business advisory services, for example? The consultancy, the PQ reply states, is for financial and commercial advisory services, but it amounts to €5.3 million, which is not an insignificant amount of money. Is it possible to provide the committee with a further breakdown of that cost in terms of, to use the vernacular phrase, billable hours? What is the Department getting for €5.3 million? What is it getting from Analysys Mason for €3.9 million and what is it getting from William Fry for €846,000 so far? That is only for 2021. It would be very useful if this committee had a further understanding of just how much money is being spent on consultancy services, not only for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - officials from that Department are here today - but for every Department of State, for that matter.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:10:00+00:00	I thank Mr. Griffin.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:10:00+00:00	I have only four minutes and Mr. Griffin has taken a fair chunk of time. I am conscious he wants to develop the point but I have a limited amount of time.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:10:00+00:00	I appreciate that. What I would like is a deeper understanding of the breakdown of these costs. We need that for every single line Department that relies on external services and consultancy. I am not sure we have a deep understanding of that. Certainly, I speak for myself in that regard. The question then, and Mr. Griffin can fold this all into the reply in two minutes, is do I take it from his reply that the Department will continue to require the services of external consultants for this? If the answer to that is "Yes", which I think it is, for how long more will it require them? It has spent €10.1 million so far. What does Mr. Griffin anticipate the future spend will be on external services for the lifetime of this project?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:10:00+00:00	With respect, I have a very short time available to me. I think we all appreciate that there is a reliance on external services. We have all acknowledged that. I am merely asking at this juncture - I think Mr. Griffin was about to defer to his colleagues on the matter - about the breakdown of costs and to have sight of the breakdown of those costs. If I could come away in the short time I have with some understanding of that and a commitment that the Department will write to the committee in that regard, I would be grateful for that.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T14:20:00+00:00	On the legal side-----
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T15:20:00+00:00	With respect, Mr. Mulligan should understand that we are at the front line in understanding people's needs. We are the people who run constituency offices. We understand full well the significance of the NBP. We also understand the deficit which exists in respect of the provision of the broadband service. I think that is self-evident, and I do not think we need to be reminded of it. I am, however, concerned about the standard of replies that my office receives when contact is made via the dedicated email address for representations to NBI. I would like to see a greater degree of transparency regarding the number of representations made through that email channel and how many of those representations from the offices of Deputies and Senators are actually resolved. I refer to a broadband connection ultimately being made. Whether we like it or not, and whatever about the commercial considerations and the costs, the fact remains that an expectation was created that a service would be rolled out. The advent of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased or fast-tracked that expectation. I think we would all agree on that point. Therefore, a demand and an expectation exist for these services, which I think is a legitimate one. I refer to people in particular circumstances of which we are all aware, whether down dale or up glen, where there is an expectation of being able to work remotely. Sometimes there is a perception that people in rural Ireland have particular types of jobs and fulfil particular types of functions.I want to remind everyone that the people in rural Ireland are the people with PhDs, MBAs, masters, and they are working remotely across pharma and academia, and that needs to be understood. They need the access; that is the bottom line. They are professional people living in these communities and they have a legitimate expectation. If there is one thing arising from today it is that the quality of engagement with Oireachtas Members should improve such that we can expect legitimately that, when we make representations on behalf of these very people whom I am talking about and there is some sort of priority give to that. Very often we are the door of last resort for these people because they have tried every other option, given they are more than capable of engaging with the commercial providers themselves and they have done so, but they are coming to us because they have no other place to go. They have a legitimate expectation of us that we would interface with representatives at nbi.ie and they would then expect, and we would expect, that we would receive some sort of a return, and a deliverable. The deliverable in this case is a connection ultimately.  That is why I was concerned by the amber map from day one. I do not profess to be an expert in; I am a layman in all of this, not a financial wizard. I have no technical knowledge in respect of networks or telephony, but I do know what the needs of my constituents are. I do not see how, in this day and age, there is not some blend of service that could be provided that is a solution for each household. I do not think there is anything that is insurmountable by way of a solution for every household given the paradigm shift that has taken place. That is where people like are coming from, quite simply. We need to get information back to this committee in respect of how many representations have been received by Oireachtas Members and how many of those have been resolved whereby a connection is made. We need some qualitative and quantitative analysis of those representations in terms of whether they are succeeding through our interventions. My second point relates to the BCPs. How many BCPs are up and running and live as we speak?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T15:30:00+00:00	What I raised with NBI was an outworking of this very issue. I would like Mr. Griffin to go away from this meeting understanding that there is a little village in north County Cork called Ballyhooly, and I deliberately use the example of Ballyhooly because he will remember that name. There is a new estate in Ballyhooly called Lios Ard, peopled by the professionals I am talking about from all walks of life, and one half of the village can get broadband and the half other cannot. This is why I am frustrated by this amber mapping. We all bought into it and now it seems that this amber map has become such an arbitrary tool that we are going to end up with a situation where there will be those people who will have and those who will not all because of a mapping exercise, ultimately. I do not know what can be done about that. The question is: what can I tell the people in Lios Ard, Ballyhooly, tomorrow morning? They are representative of thousands of people throughout this State. What hope can I give them tomorrow morning that they are going to be guaranteed a connection? That is the bottom line. That is ultimately what people want to hear.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2022-02-10T15:30:00+00:00	Like my colleague, Deputy O'Connor, we will be having a chat after this meeting.
