SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee today. We are involved in the process of examining this issue. Very often we hear voices from academia and industry but the most important voices of all are those of the witnesses. What they have done today is to articulate a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and they have done so with such clarity that I want to get copies of their submissions. They have distilled the issues with such clarity that it has given me, as a member of the committee, a clear sense of what we need to achieve now. I express our gratitude to the witnesses. I have a few questions arising from the submissions. My first question is for Ms Reynolds on the role of parents. We are trying hard to grapple with where parents come into the equation. Do the witnesses think the vast majority of parents have the confidence to monitor, as Ms Reynolds said, the activity of their children online so they can make the Internet safe for their children?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	How would this be done? If I asked Ms Reynolds to design a workshop or programme to educate or help parents would she do it in the school community or in the sporting community? If I gave her €1 million to design a programme for the country, what would be her vision and how would she do it? Would it be done during school time or out of school time? Parents are looking for programmes they can grab onto in their communities so they can educate themselves. Mr. Burke spoke about peer to peer programmes and young people teaching young people but there is a big gap in adults' minds on this issue. Will Ms Reynolds give me a sense of this? It might help in the devising of schemes here also.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	Do the other witnesses have a perspective on this?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	I am not a technophobe but I am not a technophile either. Probably like most people, I am somewhere in the middle. One does not necessarily have to fully understand the technology to be able to use it. I am an early adopter of technology but I am probably in the minority. The majority of people do not feel confident about trying to reach in and understand what their children are doing. Where is Comhairle na nÓg on this? It has its charter. How do we implement the charter? How do we get it to a point where every citizen in the country, young and old, has a sense we are designing a safe place for people to inhabit when they use the Internet? How do we get there?
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	Get the programmes up and running, start the learning and replicate them throughout the country.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	My next questions require short answers. Do the witnesses believe there is a cut-off point with regard to children and young adults? Smartphones have been spoken about quite a bit recently, and people are saying children under the age of 12 or 16 should not have access to a smartphone. What is the view of the witnesses on this? Ms Muireann Whelan wants to answer it.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	Ms Whelan is stating parental responsibility is key to all of this and there is an onus on parents.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2018-02-07T10:50:00+00:00	The relationships and sexuality education, RSE, module has been mentioned. We have had some engagement with the Department of Education and Skills and with parents about the role of teachers. What I am picking up from the witnesses is that it depends on what school someone goes to. Some teachers are very confident with technology and some are not. Should we start rolling out programmes at undergraduate level for teachers in training so they do a compulsory module on Internet safety? They would then be able to roll out programmes in their classes through RSE and other programmes.
