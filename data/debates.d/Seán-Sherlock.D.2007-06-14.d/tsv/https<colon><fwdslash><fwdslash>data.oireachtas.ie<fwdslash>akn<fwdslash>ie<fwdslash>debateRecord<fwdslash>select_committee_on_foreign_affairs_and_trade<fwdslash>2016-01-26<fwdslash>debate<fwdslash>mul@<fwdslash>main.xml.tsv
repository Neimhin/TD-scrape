[<p eid="para_8">I thank the Vice Chairman and the members of the select committee for the opportunity to discuss the motion proposed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, which has been referred to it for consideration. I am joined today by Caoimhe Ní Chonchuir, Paul O'Hara, Elisa Cavacece and Karl Finnegan from the Department.</p>, <p eid="para_9"> The motion seeks Dáil approval of the terms of the agreement establishing an association between the European Union and its member states, on the one hand, and Central America, on the other. The six countries which form Central America are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Diplomatic relations between the European Union and Central America were formally established with the San José dialogue in 1984 and were driven partly by the desire of Europe to help bring to an end the political violence and instability that afflicted the region at that time. Europe and Central America concluded a framework co-operation agreement in 1993 and a political dialogue and co-operation agreement in 2003. In 2007, the European Council authorised the Commission to begin negotiations on an association agreement. Talks on the agreement concluded in 2010 following the EU-CELAC summit in Madrid. The association agreement was signed by all parties in Honduras in June 2012 and received the approval of the European Parliament in December of that year. </p>, <p eid="para_10"> Each member state of the European Union, together with the EU and the republics of Central America, will become a party to this mixed competence agreement. It is called a mixed competence agreement because some of the areas covered by the agreement are matters of EU competence while others remain within the competence of member states. The agreement contains three pillars: political dialogue, co-operation and trade. It was agreed that the trade pillar of the agreement, which involves European Union rather than member state competence, would be provisionally applied pending the ratification by all EU member states of the agreement. The trade elements of this agreement therefore came into effect during 2013. </p>, <p eid="para_11"> To date, all six Central American republics have ratified the agreement, while on the EU side, 12 member states, including Ireland, have yet to notify the European Commission that they have completed all internal procedures necessary for the ratification of the agreement. For Ireland, receiving the approval of the Dáil is the last step of our domestic procedures necessary for its entry into force. </p>, <p eid="para_12"> I will turn now to the substance of the agreement. This agreement has real value for the European Union and its people and for the people of Central America. There are significant economic advantages for both sides. The trade pillar of the agreement will eliminate high tariffs, tackle technical barriers to trade, open up services markets and public procurement markets and protect EU geographical indications. For Europe, this means new business opportunities for European exporters and investors. For Central America, it means access to the European market of 500 million consumers and a chance to move up the industrial value chain and create better quality jobs for workers.</p>, <p eid="para_13">Over time, under the agreement import duties on industrial goods and fish will be eliminated. It is estimated that the overall value of tariff elimination on European exports will be in the region of €90 million.</p>, <p eid="para_14"> Agricultural trade will also open up, while protecting sensitive products in both regions. Central American exporters of fruit and vegetables stand to gain significantly from the agreement. Conversely, key European exports such as whiskey and wine will enjoy zero tariffs. This is good news for the producers of Irish whiskey which we already export in significant quantities to Panama.</p>, <p eid="para_15"> The agreement also simplifies customs procedures. All Central American countries will, within three years, use a single customs document, thereby reducing the administrative burden for European exporters and traders within the region. In addition, our partners in Central America have committed to removing barriers to services, trade and investment, which will make the region more attractive for European investors. When fully enacted, the reduced costs of trade should have a beneficial impact on growth and job creation in all Central American countries and it is expected that the agreement will have a poverty-reducing effect overall in the region. EU data suggest Central America’s GDP could grow by over €2.5 billion as a result of the agreement. Economic resilience will also be improved by reducing reliance on the United States as a destination for Central American exports.</p>, <p eid="para_16"> In 2014, the first full year in which the trade pillar of the association agreement was in effect, goods trade between the European Union and Central America was worth €10.5 billion, an increase of 1.2% on the figure for the previous year. The European Union is Central America’s second largest trading partner after the United States, excluding intra-regional trade. In 2014 there was a trade surplus of €1.7 billion in favour of Central America. The chief imports to the European Union from Central America are data processing machines, coffee, bananas and pineapples. The main EU exports to Central America are machinery, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and steel products. </p>, <p eid="para_17"> I reassure the committee that the agreement contains very strong safeguards for human rights, the rule of law, democratic principles, respect for the environment and workers’ rights. The very first article states human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles constitute an “essential element” of the agreement. This means that, in a situation where a government violates this essential element, any of the parties would be able to react unilaterally by taking proportional measures that could go as far as the suspension of the whole agreement. This provision is a powerful statement of our commitment to uphold our values. The co-operation pillar of the agreement commits the two sides to co-operate to achieve full compliance with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the building and strengthening of democracy. It commits the parties to work together in promoting good governance, fighting against corruption and supporting the participation of civil society in decision-making. </p>, <p eid="para_18"> The agreement has sustainable development at its heart and commits both sides to respect, implement and enforce a series of universal standards for labour rights and the environment, including the eight core conventions of the International Labour Organization. The agreement contains a binding arbitration mechanism to ensure these commitments are respected, which can be triggered unilaterally by the European Union or any of the Central American countries, even against the will of the country concerned.</p>, <p eid="para_19"> In regard to oversight, the agreement foresees the creation of a committee of parliamentarians, composed of MEPs and Deputies from the Central American parliaments. The committee will have the right to demand information and make recommendations to the European Commission and Central American governments. The agreement will also establish a civil society dialogue forum and a consultative committee, designed to allow civil society to hold government parties accountable.</p>, <p eid="para_20"> I now turn to what the agreement means for Ireland.</p>, <p eid="para_21">Many Irish people feel an affinity with Central America. From the late 1970s up to the 1990s, a solidarity movement grew up in Ireland in reaction to the political upheaval and civil wars affecting El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras and many Irish people travelled to the region in that period as volunteers. There is also a tradition of Irish missionaries in Central America, particularly from the 1970s onwards. Our relations with Central America received a significant boost with the visit of President Higgins to El Salvador and Costa Rica in 2013, where he received a very warm reception. We do not have an embassy in Central America and most Central American republics are accredited to Ireland from their embassies in London. There is, therefore, significant potential to develop our relations, which can only be assisted by an agreement such as this. </p>, <p eid="para_22"> Ireland’s trade with the region is small but growing. Ireland’s chief exports to the region include medicines, infant food, medical equipment, industrial machinery, computers and alcoholic beverages. Our chief imports from Central America include vegetables and fruit, coffee, sugar and honey. </p>, <p eid="para_23"> In 2013, total trade in goods between Ireland and the region was worth €106 million. In 2014, the first full year of operation of the free trade agreement, total trade grew to €126 million, representing growth of almost 20% in our trade. Figures from January to November 2015 show continued strong growth in Irish exports, particularly in trade with Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica. While it is not possible to prove causation, trade data seem to indicate that there is at least a correlation between the entry into force of the trade elements of the association agreement in 2013 and recent growth in Ireland’s trade with the region.</p>, <p eid="para_24"> This agreement will provide a framework for strengthening the relationship between the European Union and Central America in trade, policy dialogue and co-operation. It provides a platform for bi-regional engagement on issues concerning health, the environment, climate change, energy, education, employment and science and technology and will allow us to work together to tackle global challenges, such as migration, terrorism, money laundering, organised crime and corruption. It contains important safeguards for human rights, workers’ rights and the environment. The ratification of the EU-Central America Association Agreement not only strengthens the foundation of the relationship between the EU, its member states and Central America but also charts a course for political and economic reforms. Through Ireland’s ratification of this agreement, we will show our support for the people of Central America. </p>, <p eid="para_25"> I thank the committee again. I hope this motion will meet with the committee’s approval and that Dáil Éireann will approve the terms of the agreement so that Ireland can proceed to ratify in the near future. I am happy to take questions at this point. </p>]
[<p eid="para_44">I wish to thank Deputies in general terms for their comments. I will endeavour to reply to some of the issues that have been raised. As regards labour rights and the universal standards that apply to them, the eight core principles of the ILO are part of that agreement. As regards the main provisions of the agreement concerning human rights, if one examines the various articles inherent in the agreement, for instance, article 1 deals specifically with protections around human rights, the rule of law and democratic principles. Climate change is inherent in articles 50 and 51, so there are specific references to responsibilities in respect of those issues.</p>, <p eid="para_45"> It is evident through Irish Aid support that we have committed more than €17 million since 2012 to this region. We do much work through our partners, including Trócaire, which is a key example in terms of capacity-building to assist the people who are most directly affected, namely, the primary producers. We do much work at ground level in that respect.</p>, <p eid="para_46"> Articles 41 to 46 specifically refer to addressing poverty, inequality and exclusion. Provisions are made through specific programmes in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_47">There is a programmatic element which ensures decent work for all, respect for workers' rights, equal access to education and public health and special initiatives aimed at vulnerable groups such as indigenous communities, something on which we are very strong from an Irish perspective.</p>, <p eid="para_48"> Let us look at the trade terms. As I said, they favour Central America in trading with the European Union. In that sense, we are on a good footing. It means that primary producers trade in coffee and fruits, in particular. As Deputy Eric Byrne said, in Ireland we are good consumers of coffee. In the case of Fairtrade Ireland, Java Republic, Bewleys and other brands, not to be too brand specific at this committee meeting, there is a very strong impetus towards purchasing unroasted beans directly from producers through intermediaries but giving a fair price to the primary producer. This is now inherent within the Irish consciousness when we consume coffee. We have moved a long way from buying jars of instant coffee.</p>]
[<p eid="para_50">As a nation, we are now very discerning when it comes to ensuring a proper dividend is paid to the worker who operates in the field. We are satisfied that the agreement contains protections in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_51"> I will restate the following for the benefit of the committee. In 2014 there was a trade surplus of €1.7 billion in favour of Central America. That shows that the trade terms favour Central America. Ireland is growing its level of trade on a bilateral basis. </p>, <p eid="para_52"> On climate change, Ms Cavacece might want to reiterate what the nature of the relationship is with NGOs from an Irish Aid perspective. We are confident that everything we are doing in respect of the agreement corresponds with our foreign affairs policy on inclusive economic growth.</p>, <p eid="para_53"> I will come back to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on her question on Belize. I am pretty sure Ms Ní Chonchúir has the answer.</p>, <p eid="para_54"> On Cuba, I met Dr. Herrera in the past few weeks and we had a very positive discussion on how we could enhance and improve the relationship between Ireland and Cuba across a range of sectors, including medicines, pharmaceuticals and education. Work is ongoing between him and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in that regard. If there are specific areas about which the committee has ideas, I can assure members that the Department operates an open door policy when it comes to areas in which we can enhance co-operation.</p>, <p eid="para_55"> When we talk about equivalence, there are very specific measures in the areas of food safety, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, energy, mining, tourism, science and technology, as well as governance in terms of taxation and small to medium-sized enterprises. We are trying to reduce technical barriers to trade. Sometimes there is a certain connotation surrounding the liberalisation of markets, but we are satisfied that the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated is such that there will be very stringent checks and balances explicit within it. Also, there will be a parliamentary oversight function through the European Parliament. If one also has directly elected Members of the European Parliament overseeing these agreements, it means that when issues arise, they will come to the fore through the European Parliament.</p>]
[<p eid="para_66">I would not disagree with anything Deputy Smith has said. I share some of his concerns, as do certain European member states, on the dispute mechanism. However, we must remember that this agreement is far from being concluded. We are currently engaged in the 12th round of talks and a mechanism has been proposed by the European Union on the investment courts but we are a long way off an agreement.</p>, <p eid="para_67"> I absolutely concur with Deputy Smith on the protection of agriculture standards in particular. We have exacting food health, food provision and food production standards. There is no way we would want those in any way diminished. Agriculture is a key component of our export strategy. I totally agree with the points made by Deputy Smith, which have now been put on the record. However, an agreement is still a long way off.</p>, <p eid="para_68"> On the procedure around the negotiation of TTIP, for an association agreement, it is not just about trade as we are talking about it today. There is also political dialogue and co-operation given TTIP is a trade agreement. Mr. Karl Finnegan, who represents the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is with us here today and if the committee would like a little insight - after the meeting - on where negotiations are from a technical point of view, we would be happy to facilitate that. In political terms, we are a long way from an agreement and we all, as parliamentarians, have concerns about the dispute mechanism and the power of corporations relative to member states.</p>]
[<p eid="para_73">I thank the Vice Chairman.</p>]
