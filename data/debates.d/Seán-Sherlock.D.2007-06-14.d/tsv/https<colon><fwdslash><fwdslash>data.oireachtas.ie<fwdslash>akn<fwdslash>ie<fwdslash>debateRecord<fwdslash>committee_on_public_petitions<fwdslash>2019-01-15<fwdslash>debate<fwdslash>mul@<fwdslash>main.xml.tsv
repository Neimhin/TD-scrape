[<p eid="para_25">There is a proposal that we would discuss this further. What we have are the latest responses from the Department of Justice and Equality. The gaming and lotteries (amendment) Bill is still with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The general scheme of the gambling control Bill gives rise to the intention to establish an independent regulatory authority. There is arguably robust legislation coming down the line. The question is how should we seek to influence the acceleration of such legislation. It might be advisable to seek to have the Minister before the committee to discuss this issue specifically. I suggest the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is taking a lead role on this, might be the most appropriate Minister who might come before us. If that suggestion is agreeable, maybe we should propose that and see where we go from there.</p>]
[<p eid="para_28">There is a suggestion. In the context of the petition, which we have agreed is to remain open, I now propose that we formally write to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and ask if he would appear before the committee to discuss some of the responses that have come from the Department of Justice and Equality and take it from there. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_29"> Moving on to petition No. P00040/18, the proposal is to forward a copy of the reply from the Department of Justice and Equality to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_30"> The final petition is petition No. P00042/18. I propose that we forward a copy of the responses from the Department of Finance to the petitioner and close the petition. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>, <p eid="para_31"> The next meeting will be on Wednesday, 30 January 2019 at 1.30 p.m., which puts us back to our regular time. I thank the members for their attendance.</p>]
