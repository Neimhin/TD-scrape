[<p eid="para_139">What is the view of Teagasc and the Department on the first three proposals of the ICMSA on page 6 of the submission?  On page 4 of Teagasc's proposals in the independent review document it is stated that it had been demonstrated that in specific farm scenarios those anomalies are leading to large structural phosphorus deficits.  I would like to get a broader view of what that means in terms of understanding the language.  On pages 24 and 25 of the same document the denitrification process is referred to and it is stated that during the delay period a large proportion of nitrate is expected to be ameliorated and denitrified to environmentally benign N2 gas.  Would it be possible to explain the preceding paragraphs in layman's terms?</p>, <p eid="para_140">The reason I ask those questions is because they have a bearing in terms of calculations.  On page 3 of the Teagasc submission the introduction of new scientific research and flexibility in the closed period is referred to.  I would like an explanation of that paragraph and the transitional arrangements for pig and poultry manure.  Specific reference is made to proposed amendments in the submission on nitrogen availability in organic manures.  Could one of the Teagasc representatives expand slightly on this? It seems what is being suggested is that amendments on the simplification of calculations for maximum nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser allowance be adopted to encourage the use of pig and poultry manure by livestock farmers.  What is the basis of that advice?  I would like to know that in layman's terms because perhaps I do not fully understand the scientific language of it.</p>, <p eid="para_141">The draft GAP regulations include a mechanism through which they can be regulated to reflect the outcomes from new research on peer requirements of crops and animals as soon as these are published before the next review.  Can the delegates expand on this also?  Page 97 of the Teagasc document refers to streamlining the derogation under the GAP regulations.  This has a major bearing on outcomes in the political process.  Teagasc believes that having two separate dates associated with the process can cause unnecessary confusion for derogation applicants and participants.  Can the process be streamlined mid-stream?  What would the benefit of that be in real terms?</p>, <p eid="para_142">We are all in complete agreement that the Food Harvest 2020 proposals will have to be predicated on the notion that we can continue to maximise efficiencies and that there is a political process set up so that Ireland's comparative advantage on food production will not be compromised.  There is a programme set out for each of the sectors such as dairy, poultry, pig and so on, and the Labour Party would welcome that new programme.  If the science is suggesting that we can deal with phosphorus and nitrogen and manage it in such a way, and if Teagasc is coming up with research that ameliorates it so that we do not compromise on our production and our comparative economic advantage, then every political party will have to support a process that ensures we can achieve the best for Irish agriculture.  I happen to think that the science is there to ensure that, but I also think that a message should be sent to the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government that if there are pollutants within the agricultural sector and if he is hell bent on going down the line of constricting agricultural practices, then he must take cognisance of the fact that there are other major pollutants that are also under his remit, such as local authorities.  If the Minister spent more time going after local authorities and invested properly in infrastructure, that would significantly improve water quality in this country also.</p>]
