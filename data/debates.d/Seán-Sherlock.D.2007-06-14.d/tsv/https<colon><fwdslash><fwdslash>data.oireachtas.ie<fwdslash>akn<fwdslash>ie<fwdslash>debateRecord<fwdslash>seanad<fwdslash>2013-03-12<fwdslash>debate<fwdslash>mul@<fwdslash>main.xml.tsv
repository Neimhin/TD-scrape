[<p eid="para_397">I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</p>, <p eid="para_398"> I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on a proposed new school building for Summercove national school. The school has applied to the Department for large-scale capital funding for a new school building. The school is currently located on a half acre site and an alternative greenfield site is required for a new school In the context of the co-operation by the Department of Education and Skills with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for schools, the Department has worked with both the Office of Public Works and the local authority over a number of years in an effort to identify suitable sites for the construction of permanent accommodation for the school.</p>, <p eid="para_399"> The Senator might find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years are made. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level. To ensure that every child has access to a physical school place, it is vital that there is sufficient school accommodation available to cater for these pupil enrolments. The delivery of building projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the duration of the five-year plan, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most demographic growth will be concentrated. In this regard, Kinsale has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth. Pupil enrolment projections for Kinsale indicate that enrolments will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future.</p>, <p eid="para_400"> Officials from the Department's building unit met with Summercove school authorities in January 2013, as Senator O'Donovan explained, to explore the options that might be open to the school to improve its existing accommodation. Subsequently, a member of the Department's technical staff visited the school to examine the possibility of addressing the school's most urgent needs. However, the option of providing some permanent accommodation to replace the school's temporary accommodation and to address traffic management on the site does not appear possible due to the restricted nature of the site. The Department accepts therefore that a new site is required. However, given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years. In this regard, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a building project for the school will be progressed. I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.</p>]
[<p eid="para_402">I appreciate where Senator O’Donovan is coming from.</p>, <p eid="para_403">It does me no good to say that a school in my own county cannot have a definitive timeframe for the provision of a new school. The Government is faced with Hobson's choice at the moment because demographics do come into play. We are now faced with a situation in this country where there are pockets in metropolitan and urban areas where school places will not be available in the future. One must make provision in constrained economic times to allow for the necessity of people to be able to go to school. That is the Hobson’s choice that faces us.</p>, <p eid="para_404"> I am willing to speak to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, about the issue again. I am aware of the history of the case, dating back to 1999, and some of the difficulties that arose between some of the State agencies involved. It is not possible at this stage to state exactly when a new school will be built. One could argue that we are putting it on the long finger. I accept the point that has been made against the Government but it must prioritise those areas where school places will not be available and make provision for them.</p>]
[<p eid="para_407">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. The question posed by her as to whether there are any plans to introduce legislation to tackle higher prices charged by traders in this jurisdiction as compared with prices charged in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction seems to presume that price control measures can protect consumers from what may be perceived as high or unjustified prices. In so far as the general issue of tackling high prices is concerned, price control measures are not an effective means of reducing prices. During the 1970s and 1980s price control was used as one of the primary tools for combating increasing consumer prices and inflation. Various analyses of that period have shown that price control was an ineffective way of tackling high prices, as in many instances maximum prices prescribed for goods very quickly became minimum prices with the result that inflation during that period rose close to 20%. In addition to failing to tackle high prices, price control also effectively acted as a disincentive to businesses becoming more efficient and further prevented justified price rises arising from legitimate cost increases incurred by business. It was for that reason that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 essentially repealed the legislation which allowed for price control and there are no plans to revisit the matter.</p>, <p eid="para_408"> As regards differentials in prices for goods in this jurisdiction when compared with prices in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction, there can be legitimate reasons for prices to differ, such as exchange rate movements, different distributional costs, etc. Notwithstanding this, I do not doubt there may be instances where the level of the differential in prices charged for the same goods in the two jurisdictions cannot be justified by reasons such as exchange rate movements. In such instances, it is important that consumers use their discretion. I read the article to which the Senator refers and it is interesting to note a comment made by Mr. Mark Gould of MG Consulting who states: </p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_409">Everyone is on the web, you can see what a retailer is charging in Britain versus the Republic, so why everyone hasn't responded to that transparency I don't really understand. Retailers that get caught on this only have themselves to blame. </p>, <p eid="para_410">We all have access to the Internet and consumers can exercise their power. Their price sensitivity can determine purchasing behaviour, particularly as it relates to conspicuous consumption.</p>, <p eid="para_411"> In contrast to the price control era of the 1970s and the 1980s, Government policy in the area of prices has been focused on the promotion of competition and consumer awareness, given that freely functioning competitive markets are more effective at setting fair prices. In so far as promoting greater consumer awareness of prices is concerned, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 specifically mandates the National Consumer Agency to promote public awareness and conduct public information campaigns on issues such as prices. The agency has been very active in raising awareness of prices in a number of different areas. Evidence available to it shows that consumers are becoming more price conscious and changing their shopping habits to achieve better value for their money. It is the case, therefore, that competition and price awareness among consumers are more effective tools to tackle high prices than the price control policies of the past.</p>, <p eid="para_412"> As regards general price trends, the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office shows that prices in Ireland rose by 1.2% in the 12 months to January 2013, whereas the corresponding index in the UK, the retail prices index, shows that prices there increased by 3.3% in the same period. At the European level, the harmonised index of consumer prices, which is the accepted measure for comparing price trends across the European Union, shows that prices in Ireland increased by 1.7% in 2012 as compared with an increase of 2.3% across the Union and 2.7% in the United Kingdom in the same period.</p>, <p eid="para_413"> I am firmly of the view that consumers, by exercising the power they command, are better placed to ensure they get a fair deal than any legislative intervention that would seek to regulate the prices traders charge for goods and services. Accordingly, by informing themselves as to the different offerings in the marketplace and being strategic in their shopping decisions, consumers can help to ensure they achieve the best value for their money, which is all the more important in the current economic climate.</p>]
[<p eid="para_415">I note the article in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>of 24 February states that a shift dress on sale in the Monsoon chain is priced at £129 in Britain, which converts to just under €150, whereas the Irish price is €199. The word "shift" in Cork parlance has completely different connotations. Perhaps the Senator will enlighten me on the matter afterwards.</p>]
[<p eid="para_420">I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter and convey the Minister's regrets that he cannot attend this debate in person. To set the context, the position is that payments by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the agri-environment options scheme, or AEOS as it is commonly known, are well advanced at this stage. Before discussing the details, I emphasise the commitment of the Minister and Government to the agri-environment schemes, namely, AEOS and the rural environmental protection scheme, as operated by the Department. The schemes put environmentally friendly farming to the forefront and recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods in protecting the environment and natural heritage for the benefit of society as a whole. This commitment is evident in the fact that despite serious budgetary pressures facing his Department, the Minister opened AEOS to new applicants last year. In this regard, an additional €20 million was made available annually for five years to fund new applications under the scheme. This ongoing commitment is also evident in the fact that more than €750 million was spent by the Department on agri-environment schemes in the past three years alone, with a further €200 million available in 2013 under both REPS and AEOS.</p>, <p eid="para_421"> There are currently almost 30,000 participants in REPS and their contracts will continue until expiry of the five year contract period in each case. The successor to REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme for which funding is provided from modulation funds under the Common Agricultural Policy health check. As Senators will be aware, AEOS specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at European Union level as needing urgent action. The format of the scheme is a menu type approach, as distinct from the whole farm approach adopted under REPS. It consists of actions which can be demonstrably linked to the three important challenges targeted.</p>, <p eid="para_422"> There are approximately 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 2, which were opened to new participants in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The EU regulations governing the scheme and other area based schemes require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, is completed before any payment can issue. Previous EU audits have made it clear that compliance with the regulations must be strictly adhered to and all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues. This means payment cannot be released until all aspects of a farmer's application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved. These requirements are a significant administrative challenge, albeit one that the Department has successfully addressed. </p>, <p eid="para_423"> The current position regarding payments under AEOS is that under AEOS 1, all outstanding payments due in respect of both 2010 and 2011 have been finalised.</p>, <p eid="para_424">Of the 7,500 participants remaining in that scheme, nearly 6,500 have received payment in respect of 2012. The remaining cases are being cleared on an ongoing basis as queries are resolved.</p>, <p eid="para_425"> There are 6,250 approved participants in AEOS 2, 5,300 of whom have received a payment in respect of 2011. The outstanding cases are being finalised as outstanding queries are received. Applicants have been informed of these outstanding queries and payments are being made on an ongoing basis as responses are received.</p>, <p eid="para_426"> Last year saw the first full-year payment for AEOS 2 applicants. In order to activate payment where non-productive capital investments were selected, a valid capital investment claim form was required. The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2. In all, 2,500 have received payment at this stage. There are a large number of queries arising. To deal with the outstanding queries, additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible. The majority of the outstanding payments relate to applicants who chose a capital investment option, such as the planting of trees or hedgerows, on their AEOS contract. Under the scheme, payment for these options commences in 2012. In order to be paid for 2012, farmers must have submitted valid receipts.</p>, <p eid="para_427"> Approximately 1,000 farmers have not submitted any claim form to date and of those who did, a very high percentage had queries which require further contact with the farmer. For these farmers, no part of their 2012 payment can be issued until they submit their receipts and the outstanding issues are resolved with them. The Department has contacted farmers who have not submitted claim forms at least twice, including where possible by phone, and is now dealing with replies received and outstanding queries. Where applicants have received correspondence in this regard, they should respond as soon as possible. On the basis of responses received from letters that have issued and the phone calls made by officials in the Department, the Minister aims to ensure that all outstanding cases are resolved in the shortest time possible.</p>, <p eid="para_428"> As I have mentioned, AEOS 3 was opened to applications at the end of 2012. The funding of €20 million per annum that the Minister has provided will allow for approximately 4,000 new participants to be approved. The Department is currently processing the applications with a view to issuing approvals in the next few weeks. It is expected that payments will commence towards the end of the year.</p>, <p eid="para_429"> I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the agri-environment schemes. The Minister is at all times conscious of the importance of the payments to farmer's incomes. He asked me to convey that he will ensure that his Department continues to make every effort to expedite all payments under these schemes.</p>]
[<p eid="para_432">I fully acknowledge the points made by Senator Higgins. To be helpful, I will make sure to speak to the Minister on the issues she has outlined in respect of her constituency. A legitimate question arises if no queries arose regarding individual farmers' applications and if the files still have not been dealt with expeditiously. I will certainly relate this to the Minister.</p>]
