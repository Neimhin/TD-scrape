[<p eid="para_43">I welcome Mr. Elderfield to the committee in his role as Financial Regulator.  He will be aware that he has been dubbed the "sheriff of Dodge city".  I was expecting him to come wearing a Stetson and star.  I am delighted to see that clear, unequivocal language is developing in the regulatory regime between the regulator and Professor Honohan.  There is no room for ambiguity.  We are getting a clear message that the so-called Dodge city needs to be cleaned up.  There is an acceptance among the general public in that regard.</p>, <p eid="para_44">This is a broad ranging discussion in which I wish to raise a number of issues.  I would like to focus directly on Mr. Elderfield's submission on Anglo Irish Bank.  There is a school of thought that suggests it should be wound down.  Mr. Elderfield's view is that the cost of winding down the bank would be prohibitive.  How did he come to that conclusion and what is the basis of his logic in that regard?</p>, <p eid="para_45">Mr. Elderfield stated a small new bank was likely to be carved out and that he would apply his process on that entity.  Will he elaborate on what he means by the process?  I presume that once all of the bad assets are transferred to NAMA he will be left with an entity.  Does he believe a new entity will be created from this?  What is the vision from his perspective?</p>, <p eid="para_46">I appreciate that Mr. Elderfield would prefer to deal with the Quinn issue on a separate occasion and realise that matters are before the courts.  However, this is the first opportunity for the tribune of the people to ask questions of the regulator about Quinn Insurance.  Will Mr. Elderfield give us an insight into the motivation for his actions up to the point at which a legal process started?  For instance, did he have a mandate to tackle the solvency issues?  The reason I ask that question is that 5,000 workers feel the regulator's approach was perhaps heavy-handed.  Perhaps there was a lack of clarity as to what his motivation was and the mandate for the actions he took.  Will the regulator give us some insight into the process and the reasons behind the action he adopted?</p>, <p eid="para_47">Is it technically possible for Anglo Irish Bank to take a stake in Quinn Insurance?  Some claim it is not and that this is all just optics so Anglo Irish Bank can start a bidding war among other insurance companies for Quinn Insurance.  What are the regulator's views on this, if it is possible for him to give them to the committee at this stage?</p>, <p eid="para_48">The committee is examining the regulatory regime for credit unions.  There is broad consensus on section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 which will be addressed in the new Central Bank Reform Bill.</p>, <p eid="para_49">However, there is no consensus among the representative bodies on the regulatory framework.  Some credit union representative organisations argue regulation in the past was overly stringent due to a lack of knowledge as to how the credit union model worked.  It is argued that to achieve more efficiency in this regard a separate regulatory board for credit unions compromising credit union managers and members should be established under the Financial Regulator's framework.  What are the regulator's views on this?</p>, <p eid="para_50">Financial markets being what they are, there will always be some financial wizard to design an elaborate mechanism for making money.  Accordingly, those who regulate the markets must be almost ahead of them.  Will the cream of the financial services workforce need to be working in the Financial Regulator's office to ensure the banks do not sidestep any regulatory regime by creating elaborate mechanisms?  Does a recruitment embargo apply to Mr. Elderfield's office?  Does his office need more staff?</p>]
[<p eid="para_64">On that, there is the process that led up to the instigation of judicial proceedings, and the idea of a State owned bank taking a stake in an insurance company was mooted in the public domain.  We have the regulator before us.  It is completely legitimate for us to ask questions about the process by which that could come about and whether that is a legal process, whether it is in compliance with any rules of the European Union and whether we are not setting up a potentially monopolistic position because the VHI is already in existence.  These are completely legitimate questions which are being asked by people outside these walls in any case.  I do not understand why they cannot be answered.</p>]
[<p eid="para_256">Are the solvency ratios for all insurance companies adequate?  I may have misheard Mr. Elderfield earlier but I thought he said two insurance companies were under investigation.  Will he clarify whether he has investigated or begun proceedings against other companies?  If that is the case, will he elaborate on which companies are involved, if possible?</p>]
