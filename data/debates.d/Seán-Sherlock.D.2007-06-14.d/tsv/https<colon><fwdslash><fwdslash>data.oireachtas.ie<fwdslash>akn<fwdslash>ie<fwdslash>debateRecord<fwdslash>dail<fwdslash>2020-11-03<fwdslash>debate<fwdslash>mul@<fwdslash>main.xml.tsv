SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-11-03T22:10:00+00:00	I support the Bill. It is not the first time we have seen a Bill of this nature. I was doing research earlier and discovered that my former colleague, Willie Penrose, brought forward a similar Bill in 2000. The issue has been ongoing for a long time. With due respect to our colleagues in Sinn Féin, they are not the first to the party on this matter. There were attempts as late as 2016 by Fianna Fáil and Deputy Troy, who is now a Minister of State, to publish a Bill on this. Up until last March, Deputy Troy gave a commitment to his constituents that he supported the establishment of a single Shannon authority with statutory powers. March is not very long ago. In fact, a former Taoiseach, John Bruton, gave a commitment on the issue as well, fadó fadó. This is not new and every party and none has supported the principle of the establishment of a single authority. I did not receive a copy of the Minister of State's speech, but I listened carefully to what he said. My understanding of the Government amendment is that the Bill is deemed to be read "a second time this day nine months, to allow for an examination on the legislative landscape including a review of the current regulatory environment". One could take that at face value, but I believe the Minister of State qualified his words later in the debate when he said "if appropriate", so Members should forgive me if I am a little jaundiced in my view of whether we will ever see the establishment of a single Shannon authority with statutory powers. What the Minister of State is telling us in a coded way, if I am interpreting him correctly, is that there are too many regulatory issues and requirements in each of the statutory bodies that are involved in the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group, which is an awful mouthful, to bring them together to form one agency. The amount of legislation that would be required to do that would probably have the House dealing with it until kingdom come. However, we should try, because the problems continue. I have evidence of the work of the OPW in my constituency of Cork East. Towns such as Mallow and Fermoy were always top of the news headlines whenever there was a flooding incident. These towns have benefited from excellent work carried out by the OPW on flood alleviation. However, there is still the perennial problem of the Shannon. I represent a Cork constituency, but I recognise the fact that the good people who live in the hinterland of the River Shannon are still encountering problems. Notwithstanding the facts that there are flood risk management plans, annual work programmes and the Minister of State has set up a short- and medium-term working group, and I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State in this regard, there are still issues in respect of having a view of where we want to go and what the policy is from a high-level perspective with regard to statutory powers, so money can start to flow into each of the problems that affect the people who live on or near the River Shannon. The best way to do this is through a statutory agency. I will repeat the point that was made earlier in respect of the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group. It has not met regularly. It does not have statutory powers as a co-ordination group. I know from past experience - I have been where the Minister of State is now - that there will always be competing agencies in which egos are large, there are turf wars taking place and there is a non-acceptance of responsibility. The evidence of that is on the River Blackwater at present. There is a weir that is in such a woeful state of repair that when all the State agencies appeared before the petitions committee of this House last year, each one of them disavowed any responsibility for the repair of said weir. People's experience has been, and it is hard not to be cynical about this, that they have been led up the hill on too many occasions in the past and promised much, but very little has been delivered. I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, but I do not accept the response from the Government to this issue. There is a significant majority view on this. Certainly in Fianna Fáil it was evidenced by its Bill and statements as late as last March, while there is a history in Fine Gael of supporting the principle of setting up a State agency. Sinn Féin is now proposing it and we are supporting it. We brought forward legislation previously on this issue. I do not believe we should be cowed by the challenge it entails. One should be honest with people about what one is trying to do and tell them that it could take a number of years to establish.If the Minister is honest and forthright with people about the fact that it will take time to put in place alleviation measures, I think they will accept that. What they do not accept is being promised something in March and then, in November, for one of the three parties in power to come in to stand over a Government amendment which says that on this day in nine months' time Second Stage will be read. That is not the way to do business here. We saw it with the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill and the sick pay scheme. I appreciate the fact that when there is a tripartite Government, everybody has to be kept on board and happy. However, that does not answer the questions posed by people who live within the Shannon region and who, as it were, are served by the Shannon. I ask that the Government accept the Second Reading of the Bill tonight and that we would, through the various line committees of the Oireachtas, grapple with what is a serious and laudable aim of every party in this House, namely, to have one agency responsible for dealing this issue. If there are challenges from a regulatory point of view in terms of aligning and legislating for that, then let us just do it and manage the expectations around what it is that is trying to be achieved. It is not an insurmountable challenge. Ireland is a small country. People know each other. By and large, relationships are informal. If a couple of heads have to be knocked together to make it happen in the State agencies, let it be so, but let us try to be progressive about dealing with this issue. Let us get on with the business. It has been going on for donkey's years at this stage.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-11-03T23:40:00+00:00	I welcome the Minister to the House tonight as it is a sign that she is giving this very important matter the recognition it deserves. I will speak to the future of the Tidy Towns competition. I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on 17 September asking if the Tidy Towns competition would be allowed to proceed in 2021 under the current social distancing and public health guidelines. The Minister replied by saying the Tidy Towns competition has a unique place in Ireland's culture and since its inception in 1958, when it had 52 entrants, the competition has grown year on year to see a record number of 924 entrants in 2019. Unfortunately, the 2020 SuperValu Tidy Towns competition had to be cancelled this year on public health grounds due to Covid-19. The work of the Tidy Towns committees is built on communities coming together and working together; in the position we found ourselves in this year, it would not have been possible for committees around the country to deliver their projects in the usual way. The Minister acknowledges the importance of the competition. There are many committees throughout the country that want to continue if they can adhere to public health guidelines. They are seeking some solace from the Minister and the public health guidelines interpretation that there will be a competition next year. They are seeking the goodwill of the Government and the Minister so she might seek to do her very best to ensure the competition proceeds next year because of the importance of the competition. That is self-evident but if the committees had some words of comfort or a view on how the competition might proceed in 2021, it would give people a great lift in these times. We know the character of the volunteers involved with the Tidy Towns competition and that there are many people who are semi-retired or retired who work on it. It is a competition that encourages young and older people to be involved. They just want some guidance and direction from the Minister. If it is in the affirmative, they would welcome such comment. Will the Minister work with the Tidy Towns competition in a way that will allow it to proceed in 2021? It would be a positive step on the part of the Government and for each of the committees involved.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Sean Sherlock	2020-11-03T23:40:00+00:00	I am grateful to the Minister for her reply and it was worth staying up this late just to hear such an assertive and affirmative reply from the Minister. There is no ambiguity from the Minister about the future of the competition in 2021 and the more than 924 applicants that will be there will be delighted with the news. It is a very genuine competition and the people involved are the salt of the Earth. They do so much for their community and it is such a valuable competition. I acknowledge the role of SuperValu in the sponsorship in brings along with the State intervention. Its impact is enormous and in the midst of Covid-19, the social value of this competition is highlighted even more. This is a very positive response from the Minister and all the volunteers will be delighted. It will lead to yet further enhancement of our communities across the State and I sincerely welcome the Minister's reply. I welcome the fact that it was so unambiguous and direct. On this night of the US election, it is worth getting an answer like that at 11.50 p.m. It is rare that one gets a positive answer when putting down a Topical Issue coming up to midnight. This is a very positive response and I thank the Minister sincerely for it.
