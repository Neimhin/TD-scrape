[<p eid="para_2070">The Minister for Finance said those earning the new reduced minimum wage would not be brought into the tax net.  I seek clarification in this regard.  Financial Resolution No. 12 states:</p>, <p class="indent_1" eid="para_2071">That, with effect from 1 January 2011, there shall be charged, levied and paid, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution, a tax to be known as "universal social charge".</p>, <p eid="para_2072">This is an acknowledgment that the universal social charge is a tax.</p>, <p eid="para_2073">What is the situation in respect of the minimum wage?  The charge will not be levied on incomes up to €4,000, at 2% on incomes up to €10,036 and at 4% on the next €5,980.  There needs to be further clarification of the position of people who are earning the minimum wage.  The Labour Party interpretation is that this charge is a tax to be levied on those in receipt of the new reduced minimum wage.  If that is the case, it is grossly unfair.</p>]
