SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister for Finance said those earning the new reduced minimum wage would not be brought into the tax net.  I seek clarification in this regard.  Financial Resolution No. 12 states:That, with effect from 1 January 2011, there shall be charged, levied and paid, in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution, a tax to be known as "universal social charge".This is an acknowledgment that the universal social charge is a tax.What is the situation in respect of the minimum wage?  The charge will not be levied on incomes up to €4,000, at 2% on incomes up to €10,036 and at 4% on the next €5,980.  There needs to be further clarification of the position of people who are earning the minimum wage.  The Labour Party interpretation is that this charge is a tax to be levied on those in receipt of the new reduced minimum wage.  If that is the case, it is grossly unfair.
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The Minister is catching them at 4%
SeanSherlock	Deputy Seán Sherlock	None	The minimum wage is subjected to tax.
