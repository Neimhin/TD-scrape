[<p eid="para_108">I welcome the witnesses. I would like to start with foster carers. How many additional foster carers were recruited as a result of the awareness-raising campaign?</p>]
[<p eid="para_110">I thank Mr. Gloster. I would like to draw his attention to a recent report by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on services in Cork. The report identified unacceptable delays in respect of the child protection notification system. Has there been an improvement in those services? What improvement has arisen from that report?</p>]
[<p eid="para_113">I would like to move on to Kerry. Recent media reports highlighted the failure to refer 365 cases of suspected child abuse in the Kerry area.</p>, <p eid="para_114">One report in <i>The Irish Times</i> said some delays were attributed to "efforts by social workers to substantiate the abuse allegations before making a referral". In asking these questions one tries to be as sympathetic as possible to those on the front line who had to go through each of the cases. I understand that 122 cases related to suspected abuse of children under the age of 18. Of these, 19 were given a high priority. I understand that about 115 cases were deemed to be of medium priority. </p>, <p eid="para_115"> Mr. Gloster used the word "consistency". I have highlighted it in his submission to the committee. Where do services in Kerry stand now as a result of this noted failure? One does not want to attribute blame but if there are delays we must ask why. Are delays a function of people within Tusla being overloaded or overworked? Is an excessive burden placed on individuals or teams seeking to ensure these cases are dealt with appropriately and in accordance with protocol and law and that they are watertight? Are people in Tusla getting the resources they need to triage these cases? </p>]
[<p eid="para_123">I appreciate that. If I was to extrapolate from Ms Duggan's answer, it could be argued that there were people who were dealing with cases that arguably were beyond their experience. I think that would be a fair comment. Yes or no?</p>]
[<p eid="para_126">Can I make one more intervention?</p>]
[<p eid="para_128">I apologise. I will ask my question. We are endeavouring to understand how the culture of the Child and Family Agency works. I accept the statement of the CEO today in respect of moving the culture on or changing practices, culture and structures. We accept the bona fides of the CEO in that respect. When we use a term such as "variation", it is meaningless to me. It suggests to me there is a massive variation in practices in different parts of the country when it comes to timelines and to how cases are dealt with. If we are to be helpful to our constituents, we need to have a greater understanding of the culture that exists within. To be frank about it, notwithstanding the CEO's statement today, which I find very helpful, my perception is that there is still a long way to go before a lot of the practices that are happening within the Child and Family Agency are deconstructed such that the services flow more seamlessly, as constrained and all as it is by staffing and other administrative challenges. That is the point, essentially. There is more work to be done and we will have to revisit this.</p>]
