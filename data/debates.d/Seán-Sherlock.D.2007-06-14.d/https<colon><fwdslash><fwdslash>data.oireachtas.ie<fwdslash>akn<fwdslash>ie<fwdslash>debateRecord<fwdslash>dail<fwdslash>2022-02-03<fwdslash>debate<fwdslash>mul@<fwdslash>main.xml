            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Claire Kerrane</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> if her attention has been drawn to concerns from trade unions representing employment service staff in relation to their engagement with a company which was awarded a contract as part of tender phase 1 and with regard also to the recent Workplace Relations Commission recommendation on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [5727/22]</p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">The Minister will be well aware of the situation in Laois-Offaly with the local employment job services and job clubs following the first tender process. She will also be aware that staff protesting there suspended their industrial action just before Christmas to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. The Minister’s Department has refused to engage in that process, which was proposed by the WRC. I ask the Minister to comment on that and on the situation in Laois-Offaly regarding the trade union.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Last May, my Department, under phase 1 of an expansion of employment services and in accordance with its legal obligations sought tenders for the provision of a new local area employment service in Laois-Offaly. I understand that existing job clubs providers in Laois-Offaly did not submit a tender for those counties, which removed any chance of them continuing to provide employment services in the area after the end of 2021. The outcome of this open and transparent procurement process was not contested by any party. I understand that all former job clubs' staff in Laois-Offaly were offered employment under existing terms and conditions by the new provider. I also understand that early last month the staff commenced training with the successful new provider. Accordingly, no one has lost employment or has seen any reduction in terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> I am not aware of any Workplace Relations Commission recommendation on this matter. However, on 15 December 2021, the Workplace Relations Commission wrote to my Department regarding ongoing work stoppages in job clubs in Offaly and Laois. I understand that those stoppages related to protests concerning the procurement process generally and that no formal dispute has been registered with the new service provider. My Department is not the employer of any of its service partners' staff, nor is it a party to an industrial dispute with any of its service partners or their employees. It would therefore be inappropriate for the Department to engage in discussions at the WRC, which is a forum to resolve disputes between an employer and its employees. The Department has, however, advised the WRC that it is available to provide any information or clarification directly to the WRC, if required.</p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_5">Regarding the talks proposed by the WRC, I am sure it understands and is aware of the situation and the relationship the Department has with the job clubs and local employment services, LES. It is not a case of the Department being the direct employer, and especially not now when we know a private company has stepped into that role. The WRC has invited representatives of the Department to what are exploratory talks, and I am sure the WRC has the knowledge and wherewithal to know the relationship between the Department and the job clubs in Laois and Offaly. The private company which has won the contract and taken over the services in that area has refused to recognise SIPTU for collective bargaining processes. In this day and age, that is inappropriate. SIPTU has represented workers in job clubs in Laois-Offaly for 25 years. In 2022, it is hard to believe that any company would deny or refuse to recognise a trade union such as SIPTU.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">I understand that the new employer, Turas Nua, has had multiple meetings with representatives of SIPTU who said there was a collective bargaining agreement in place. This matter needs to be addressed with the employer, as the Deputy knows. A collective agreement is not compulsory under law, as I understand it.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The WRC is a forum for resolving employment issues which arise between an employer and its staff. The Department of Social Protection is not an employer of the staff concerned and it is not a party to any employment dispute. It would therefore be inappropriate for it to be directly engaged with the talks at the WRC. The Department has advised the WRC that it is available to support and assist it through clarifying, to the extent that it can, any questions that may be raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_8">I know the Department is not the employer of the staff. I am sure the WRC knows that as well, but it has still invited representatives of the Department to attend the exploratory talks. It is disappointing that Turas Nua, which has won this contract, is failing to grant recognition. It may have had meetings and discussions but it is not willing to recognise SIPTU for collective bargaining agreements and purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> The Minister said the existing job clubs in Laois and Offaly had not applied. The Minister will be aware, however, that no job club survived the first tender process. She will also know, as she said it herself, that lessons were learned from the first tender process. Clearly, in many cases in that first tender process the local employment services and job clubs could not tender. That must be acknowledged, and the Minister will know it from speaking to people from the local employment services and job clubs on the ground. They were not in a position to tender in the first phase. While the next tender has had some improvements made to it, it means those involved in the first phase are now gone from the process. They are wiped out and that is also disappointing.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> I ask the Minister to look at this issue, particularly regarding SIPTU’s collective bargaining involvement and the Department’s role in the context of being invited to talks by the WRC.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">We have been down this road a few times regarding the local area employment services. The legal advice from the Attorney General is clear - these services have to be put out to tender. Community organisations won out in two of the three areas where they submitted bids under phase 1. That shows clearly that the community can win these contracts. As the Deputy is aware, the requests for tender for phase 2 were published in December. Following feedback, several changes were made in the request for tender, RFT, including increasing the marks awarded for quality to 80% and reducing costs to 20%. There is also a minimum cost component. We diluted the cost component and increased the referral numbers. The Deputy raised the matter of the requirement for reference contracts and minimum turnover, and they have also been reduced. We have, therefore, made a good number of changes to the process. We said we would take the lessons learned from the first phase and apply them to the second phase.</p>

            <p eId="para_12">2. <b>Deputy Sean Sherlock</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> the changes that are foreseen in the delivery of community welfare office services; if it is intended to centralise those services; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [5712/22]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I raise this issue because I am extremely concerned that the Department is now pulling back community welfare services where they are delivered in face-to-face settings in the most local of centres, particularly in rural areas. Based on what I have heard so far, my fear is that the Minister is not renewing any leases that her Department may have had with the HSE for the delivery of these services in what were called traditional dispensaries or health centres. What is the Minister’s position on this matter?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The community welfare service of my Department delivers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is the safety net within the overall social welfare system. The scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants. The Deputy can be assured that I am focused on the delivery of crucial community welfare services to meet the challenges and needs of customers throughout the country. This remains a priority for me and for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> I am fully committed to developing and enhancing access to the community welfare service nationwide and to ensuring the service is responsive to customer needs, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency. There are no plans in place to centralise the community welfare service, and the continued availability of locally-based community welfare officers, CWOs, will remain a key feature of the service. It is important that the community welfare service remains a flexible service to meet the varying needs of vulnerable customers. For this reason, consultations can be arranged by telephone, at our Intreo centres and social welfare branch offices, which are open five days a week or by a direct home visit is possible, depending on the customer's needs and public health restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Furthermore, customers no longer have to meet in person with a community welfare officer to make a claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">Access to community welfare services is not limited to a face-to-face meeting with a community welfare officer. </p>
            <p eId="para_18"> To help our customers and support our community welfare officer, where possible, the preparatory work on customer applications, for example the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim, will be carried out by a back-office team. However, the assessment and decision on claims and any further customer interactions or engagements with other agencies is then carried out by locally based community welfare officers as has always been the case. </p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">I am trying to listen carefully to the language of the Minister's reply. I am not reassured by it. The premise on which I base my question is the right of the citizen to interact face to face with an officer. I am asking the Minister for clarification because I am hearing that her Department is not renewing leases in respect of certain traditional centres such as health centres which delivered in community and in the most rural areas. Is that the case?</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> All Deputies represent the poorest and the most vulnerable. We accept the fact that the supplementary welfare allowance system is an excellent system because it delivers to the poorest. We know that the Minister's Department gave nearly €43 million in exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2021. My fear now is that for the citizen who does not have access to the nearest town, who traditionally might have had access in the local village where there was a visiting community welfare officer in the local health centre, that system will stop. If that stops it just takes the citizen that bit further away from the service.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">The increased back-office support in place across the greater Dublin area and in counties Kildare and Wicklow has been found to have improved the service to customers, especially at times of particular pressure such as during periods of staff absence due to the Covid pandemic. It ensures that a swift response is available to customers, resulting in significant decreases in the time waiting for a claim to be paid regardless of the prevailing circumstances in place. It is vital that the community welfare service is easily accessible and responsive to customer needs, and developing and enhancing access to the service remains my priority. If people want to see a community welfare officer in person they can do it but there are quicker ways to access the support if they need it. The system is very straightforward. They can meet the community welfare officer in person, do it by phone, or house visits can be arranged by appointment. I am very supportive of this. It is a vital service. It something that I want to see in place.</p>

I am happy that my officials can write to him on it. We have all changed the way we do business since Covid. People have been working remotely. The officials in my Department and particularly community welfare officers have found that some people find it more easy to pick up the phone and make that call. They do not have to make a trip. They can make the phone call and if they are in need, the payment should be with them very quickly. For others a home visit is necessary or face-to-face contact. We will continue to provide the service in all of those different ways.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">This is to ask the Minister about the six-year rule. It is an issue I have raised previously in respect of the rural social scheme, RSS. A number of welcome changes to community employment were announced before Christmas. They have been extended to the scheme, which is welcome as well. None of them addresses the issue that has been brought up by so many of those on the ground in respect of the six-year rule. That is the specific part of the question I would like answered.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The RSS is an income support scheme providing part-time employment opportunities for farmers and fishers who are in receipt of specified social welfare payments and who are underemployed in their primary occupation. The scheme offers participants the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and provides valuable services to local rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> To qualify for RSS, a person must be actively farming or fishing and must satisfy the means test assessment required to qualify for the farm assist payment. During 2017 and 2018, the number of places funded under the scheme was increased by 750, bringing the total number of places available to 3,350. A six-year time limit was also introduced for new RSS participants with effect from February 2017. The limit was introduced to ensure that places would be available for newer cohorts of eligible persons and aligns the scheme with other employment support programmes, including community employment, CE. The six-year limit only applies to new entrants to RSS from February 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Prior to the introduction of the six-year time limit, an RSS participant could remain on the scheme for a significant part of their working life. This had the effect of limiting turnover of places on RSS thereby reducing the opportunities for potential new entrants. The first group of participants is scheduled to leave RSS on the basis of the six-year rule in February 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> On 21 December last, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I were pleased to announce a number of changes to RSS and the CE scheme. These changes included the expansion of the service support stream on CE with the qualifying age being reduced from 62 to 60. This rule change was also extended to RSS so that all participants who reach 60 years of age can also remain on the scheme until they reach State pension age. This rule change means that the six-year rule no longer applies to RSS participants over the age of 60. This change will immediately benefit 390 RSS participants who may spend additional time on the scheme after 2023 and will continue to provide services to local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I met with a number of RSS and Tús supervisors and co-ordinators from seven counties on Monday. The first thing I was struck by is that they really do not feel listened to, particularly the Tús staff. I appreciate that this is not in the question this morning but I wanted to convey that message back to the Minister of State. They really feel like the poor relation and very last in everything that is done. They have a number of concerns around referrals. Tús is a one-year scheme and they would really like to see that go to two years. There is a major issue in respect of referrals. Tús has 390 places. In 2021, they were given 173 referrals and of those, 53 were employed by the rural development company at the end. They are sanctioned when they do not fill their places but they do not get the referrals. Each of the representatives from the seven counties raised that with me as a concern. There is an issue with referrals. I want to raise that as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">To briefly touch on Tús, there was quite a bit of leeway given during the Covid pandemic in terms of referrals and the consequences of not filling places. That is easing now. I refer to the operational forum that we are running in respect of CE and Tús where issues can be fed in. It is something that we have heard previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> I want to give the RSS a little time. It is an extremely important scheme. Its impact is not just the increased income for participants; there is the contribution that they make to the community as well. Last October, I was in Feenagh, County Leitrim, at an event organised by RSS participants. There were 30 men at it who came from a radius of 20 or 30 miles. It was clear from speaking to them that the value of it for them individually was enormous because it was one of their few social outlets outside of the pub, which was not an option during the Covid pandemic. From that point of view, I am very aware of the value of the scheme and I am interested in protecting and growing it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Claire Kerrane<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">Referrals are an issue. I appreciate what was announced just before Christmas was that the Department would look at a significant ramping up of referrals. That is really important. Even if it was relaxed during the Covid pandemic, it makes no sense to sanction where the participants are just not getting the referrals. They want the referrals. As the Minister of State said, the work done in the communities will not be done otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">There is no doubt about that. The six-year rule has implications. Many schemes are finding that they will lose people next year and the year after. They already cannot fill their places, so I am unsure as to how they will fill them when they lose people. I see no need for the six-year rule. There is no issue of places being blocked for other people, given that the current number of places cannot even be filled. It is not good enough to say that we have to have a six-year rule because we need to ensure schemes are open to other people. There were just 170 referrals for 390 places.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">We will be reviewing the rural social scheme, RSS, this year and the six-year rule will be in the mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> Regarding Tús, my understanding is that the majority of places have been filled and it has been going well. Compared with community employment, CE, schemes, the rate at which places are being filled has been quicker.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> On Monday, I met RSS participants in Meath - perhaps it was some of the same people - who spoke highly of the scheme. One lady in particular who used to be an RSS participant is now managing the Slane community and tourism hub and spoke highly of the scheme. The RSS co-ordinator in the area spoke about its importance. Meath does not have the most participants. As the Deputy knows, that falls to the west, but those I met made points about the RSS and were aware of the review. I encouraged them to feed into the process. If the Deputy could encourage other RSS participants and supervisors whom she is in touch with to do likewise, I would appreciate it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_40">I thank the Deputy for raising this question. Before the introduction of temporary public health measures in March 2020, the default payment method for jobseekers was cash collection at a post office. Nevertheless, one in four jobseeker payments was still paid into customers' bank accounts. These include those in receipt of a jobseeker's payment upon reaching the age of 62 years and who are given options as regards payment method.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> When health restrictions were introduced in 2020, all jobseekers were given the option of being paid into a bank account. This was an exceptional temporary measure to help reduce the spread of the virus and to ensure that people could comply with social distancing guidelines. This was the right approach to take at the time when we were faced with the worst of Covid-19 without having vaccines and with only limited knowledge of the virus.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> In line with the general easing of Covid-19 restrictions, I have asked my Department to revert to the normal payment rules for jobseeker's payments. This is the right approach to take in terms of supporting the post office network - a key piece of the financial and social infrastructure of the country - in ensuring that, with the removal of restrictions, we return to the pre-pandemic position. This change will initially apply to new claims. Over the coming months, my Department will work to extend the post office requirement to other jobseeker claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> Retail has reopened nationally and is operating safely. The post office network has remained open throughout the pandemic and has processed approximately 45 million social welfare payments over the past two years. Post offices have been equipped with fixed sanitiser units so that customers can sanitise their hands. Post offices also have clearly marked signs to assist with social distancing and staff operate behind transparent screens.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I acknowledge that some people who are immunocompromised may want to avoid crowded settings. For someone in that situation, the advice is to contact the nearest Department of Social Protection office. My officials are there to help.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_45">I thank the Minister for her response. My question was motivated by a number of factors. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we are reverting to something that could be an inconvenience. I understand that social welfare payments to recipients were always made via post offices, but there was a break from the norm. During that time, was there evidence of an increase in welfare fraud, for example? I asked for a rationale for the decision and it cannot just be to revert to what was the previous situation, which might not have been beneficial, or be about the post office network. While the network is vital to Ireland's infrastructure, why is it that social welfare recipients have to be the ones to rejuvenate it? There are any number of other factors at play in that regard, including public transport in rural areas. Given that the post office network is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I wonder why this matter is under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Social welfare recipients have rights. It will be an inconvenience for some, for example, getting buses and the cost of travel. At a time when people are already living below the poverty line, why do they have to be the ones to rejuvenate the post office network as opposed to having a more practical online payment scheme?</p>

            <p eId="para_47">All we announced last week was simply a return to the jobseeker's payment system that had always been in place before the pandemic whereby people collected their payments at post offices. This is about supporting our post office network. Post offices are an integral part of communities across the country. I have met the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post. They were clear that the loss of footfall relating to these payments was having a severe impact on rural and urban post offices. Deputies on all sides of the House have called for the Government to put more services into our post offices. Here is an example of that happening in practice and is something that we should support. I met Mr. Tony Wall, the postmaster at Usher's Quay, last week. When we made this announcement, he told me how important this decision was for post offices. Post offices, postmasters and postmistresses do great work the length and breadth of this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">It is without question that our post offices are vital pieces of infrastructure, but what other measures is the Government taking to rejuvenate them? People highlight any number of factors behind the decline of post offices, but there only appears to be one solution, that being, a procession of unemployed people having to travel to their post offices, stand in queues and receive payments that could more practically be made online.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The Minister referred to how immunocompromised people may not want to stand in queues. Is it now the policy that people can make a case to the Department for opting out? That would be beneficial. Will it be based on an official's discretion?</p>

            <p eId="para_51"> What we are doing with this is putting things back the way they were prior to Covid. As the Minister for Rural and Community Development, I want to support post offices and our rural towns and villages. We want to look at ways of putting new services in place. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has responsibility for post offices but we all have a responsibility to try to support them. I am working with her to see what other services can be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> We have to be mindful that we are living in a digital age. I know that. We have to be realistic, but we can put our heads together and try to support our post offices in every way we can.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">I thank the Deputy for raising this important question. The programme for Government commits the Government to acting to reform our child maintenance system and addressing key issues such as calculation, facilitation and enforcement, guided by international best practice and in light of the findings of the child maintenance review group's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> In line with this commitment, the Government established a child maintenance review group to examine certain issues in respect of child maintenance. The group is chaired by former Circuit Court Judge Catherine Murphy and includes legal, policy and academic professionals as well as officials from my Department and the Department of Justice. The group's terms of reference are to consider and make recommendations on the current treatment of child maintenance payments in my Department; the current provisions regarding liable relatives managed by my Department; and the establishment of a child maintenance agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The work of the group is well under way. To date, it has held 14 meetings. Further meetings are planned on a regular basis until the report's completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">A consultation process to facilitate feedback from stakeholder groups and members of the public to inform the group's work was undertaken last year. I have been advised by the chair that the group's report is expected to be submitted to me before Easter. Given the importance and complexity of the issues, I am satisfied with the amended timeline set out by the chair. I trust this clarifies the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">I hope the report, because it is long-awaited, will be published as soon as possible after the Minister receives it. As she knows, there are considerable difficulties. I have never believed the court was the right place for child maintenance to be agreed. We know that where a court order is made for maintenance, it does not necessarily mean payments are made. It falls on the lone parent again to go back to court. The court is not the right setting for sorting out child maintenance. It does not work. Once the maintenance is agreed, it is not necessarily paid. It is automatically regarded as means when it comes to other social protection payments. That is an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> We brought forward proposals in 2017 and 2019 reflective of the model in place in the north of Ireland. It takes the matter out of the lone parent's hands and sorts out the maintenance for him or her for the benefit of the child. That is what we need to examine. We need the review group to recommend a statutory child maintenance service. I hope that is something the Minister will seek to progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">We are absolutely on the one page on this; I agree with the Deputy. There is nothing worse than what she has described. I saw the problem myself when I worked in the credit union and, indeed, the bank. Whenever a lone parent, who was usually a woman, got a court order, it was a case of a payment being made one week and missed for the next couple, followed by another payment. It was terribly frustrating.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The work of the review group is important. It did ask for a bit of extra time. The matter is complex. A lot of work has been put into it. I look forward to receiving the report at Easter. I do not want to pre-empt what will be in the report but I want to work with the House to move this forward. There are different models in different countries, and it is a question of finding the best one that works well for us here. I am committed to doing that. I acknowledge the Deputy has a great interest in this also, as do many of the other female Members of the Oireachtas. In this regard, I got a copy of a long submission that one of the Senators made to the child maintenance review group. The matter is complex but I want to work on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">Let me outline one step the Minister could take regarding child maintenance; I ask her to consider it. In the small number of cases where child maintenance is fully paid, we should really consider removing it from the means test. It should not be seen as household means. Child maintenance, when paid, is for the benefit of the child; it is not household means. One thing the Minister could do, with or without the report, is investigate this. Child maintenance should not be calculated as household means; it is for assisting and rearing the child. We know how it is becoming increasingly expensive to rear a child. Child maintenance payments should not be included as household means. The Minister could consider this. I ask her to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">At the minute, the income from maintenance payments is assessed as means. In most cases, 50% of the person's weekly maintenance payment is assessed. That is half of it. There is a further disregard of €95.23 per week, with the balance of any maintenance being assessed at 50%. I take the Deputy's point but the matter will be considered in the review. It is best to await the report because I am aware that the issues I have asked the group to consider are quite detailed and complex. I am waiting to see what the report says.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_70">The report of the Commission on Pensions was published on 7 October 2021. It established that the current State pension system is not sustainable and that changes are needed. The report set out a wide range of recommendations in relation to the State pension system and social insurance fund, including PRSI base broadening measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> In the interests of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the commission's report very carefully and holistically. The report has been referred to the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands. That committee published its views yesterday. My officials and I will obviously include these in our deliberations over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Separately, as set out in its terms of reference, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare is considering the report of the Commission on Pensions in the context of its review of potential changes to the social insurance system, including relevant PRSI rate and coverage recommendations. In addition, my officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across government through the Cabinet committee system.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> It is really important that we complete that work and obtain those views before reaching conclusions on any one recommendation, such as the recommendations to remove the exemption to pay PRSI on supplementary pension income, occupational and personal pensions and public sector pensions. I intend to bring a recommended response and implementation plan to the Government by the end of March this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> The State pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland. It is extremely effective at ensuring that our pensioners do not experience poverty. This Government is committed to ensuring that this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State pension age and today's young workers, including those who are only starting their careers.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">As the Minister stated, the State pension is a bedrock of the system; however, there are people who, for different reasons, do not qualify for one. The draft commission report recommended that pensioners pay more PRSI, but through having the solidarity rate and by the removal of the exemption on supplementary pensions. A supplementary pension sounds like something extra. For many, it is their only source of income.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I am pleased that the joint committee published its report and made recommendations on the PRSI changes, but the whole question around supplementary pensions needs to be addressed. Pat, a constituent of mine, and a number of others have written to me to outline that the supplementary pension is their only source of income. They have already paid the pension levy. Purchasing power has been reduced. What certainty can the Minister give people, especially those in receipt of supplementary pensions, that they will not see a cut to their pensions?</p>

            <p eId="para_78">There is a process, and I have outlined what is still to happen in that regard. The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to stand here today and tell the Deputy which recommendations the Government will accept or otherwise. The discussions will continue over the coming weeks and months. The plan is that the Government will outline its full response to the commission's recommendations by the end of March. I appreciate that there are concerns, but let us not be in any doubt that there are no easy options. People are living longer, which is very positive, but it means there are challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Today, there are 4.5 people working for every pensioner. By 2050, there will be two people working for every pensioner. The current pension system is not sustainable and there is no getting away from that fact. Of course, this is not a problem that is unique to Ireland. Countries all over the world are grappling with the same issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">Many of those who contacting me point to the fact that no pensioner was on the Commission on Pensions. They worry about how they are going to have their say and how their voice is going to be part of the whole engagement. In the absence of pensioner representation, they see these different proposals coming forward. They are threatening proposals that they feel will reduce their only income. How does the Minister propose that their voices will be heard within the system in view of the fact that there was no pensioner on the commission?</p>

            <p eId="para_81">Actually, there was a broad range of people on the commission, including a representative of Age Action or Age Friendly Ireland. I cannot remember off the top of my head which organisation was represented. It was either Age Action or Age Friendly Ireland. There were a lot of experts on the commission. As the Deputy will be aware, Ms Josephine Feehily headed up the commission. We included a broad range of people. When I announced the members of the commission it was broadly welcomed by everybody that there was a good mix of people. There are some young people, older people, academics, actuaries and experts on pensions. The unions, including SIPTU, were represented. A broad range of people were represented. The commission spent a great deal of time considering the matter. The report runs to hundreds of pages. To be fair to the members, they did a huge body of work. As I said to the Deputy earlier, I am not going to start commenting on any specific measure. We cannot pick and mix. It is a package of measures and the Government will make a decision on it. We will bring a recommendation forward at the end of March.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I was pleased earlier when I heard that the Government is going to examine cost of living again and the impact that it is having. My question is very pertinent because it is about giving the Covid bonus payment to the 500,000 family carers around the country. There would be no better way of showing that the work of carers is really respected and that the Government recognises the severe impact that energy prices and fuel prices have had on carers throughout the State. I ask the Minister to go back to Cabinet and fight for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">My Department provides a comprehensive package of carers' income supports, including the carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the carer's support grant. Combined spending on these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed €1.5 billion. There are currently 2,976 recipients of carer's allowance in County Mayo. The Minister for Health has confirmed the payment of a Covid recognition payment, ring-fenced to certain workers ordinarily on-site in Covid-19-exposed healthcare environments. This payment is a matter for him and is not under the responsibility of my Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_85"> Insofar as my role as Minister for Social Protection is concerned, I have done my utmost to support the invaluable work and role played by carers in our society. Despite the extra financial demands due to the Covid-19 crisis, I increased the carer's support grant by €150 to a rate of €1,850. This is the highest rate since its introduction. In budget 2022, I introduced a range of measures benefiting family carers directly, including a €5 increase in maximum rate of all core weekly payments with effect from January; a €3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over, and a €2 increase for those up to age 12, in all core weekly payments; a €5 increase in the fuel allowance from €28 to €33 per week from 12 October 2021; an increase in the weekly income disregard for carer's allowance to €350 a week for single carers, and to €750 for carers with a spouse or partner; and an increase in the capital or savings disregard for carer's allowance from €20,000 to €50,000. I assure the Deputy that I am very aware of the key role of carers and, in particular, the challenges they faced in light of Covid-19. I trust this clarifies the matter for her.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I would still ask the Minister to go back to Cabinet and highlight the issue. I know that the Covid recognition payment is a matter for the Minister for Health, but there is an opportunity for the Department of Social Protection to look at the cost of living in terms of the 500,000 people who have probably contributed the most during the pandemic, and to give them the Covid payment. The past two years were tough for many. I wholeheartedly welcome the bonus of €1,000 for front-line healthcare workers, including ambulance workers and others. I understand that many other groups of workers also had reasonable requests for some recognition of their contribution. However, carers' shifts never end and they had no respite during the pandemic. They often did not have the time to do homeschooling either. They really were the ones that were there, and they did not get a break at all. We all know the carers in our communities, as I am sure the Minister does. I ask the Minister to go back to Cabinet and fight for carers at this particular time. There are carers living in rural areas who have to pay for fuel for going to hospital appointments and so on, and for energy to heat their homes. The Minister knows of the extra costs involved. This payment could be given to them as a once-off payment in recognition of their work.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">The Deputy is correct. Carers do incredible work; I accept that. I meet them in my constituency. We help them fill out the forms and we help them to get the benefits, and all those things. I am the first Minister in 14 years to do anything about the means test for the carer's allowance. It was an issue that I was very passionate about. That change means that all carers currently on a reduced rate of payment will see their payment increase from next June. It will also mean that tens of thousands more carers, who did not qualify up to this point due to the income threshold, will now qualify for the payment. The increase in the income disregard for a couple was something that I really wanted to improve, because I was aware that in many cases a partner who was a carer, and usually a mother, might have to give up her job to care for a sick child, but because the husband was working or they had savings, they just did not qualify for the benefit. As a result of the changes I am making, a couple can earn up to €750 a week, and the first €50,000 in savings will not be impacted or counted. I know the family carers and Care Alliance Ireland have warmly welcomed these changes. We have increased the carer's support grant, we have increased the weekly payment and we have reformed the means test. My next priority is to ensure that we can provide carers with a pension. That is something that I hope to progress as part of our consideration of the report of the Commission on Pensions.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government is committed to supporting households to control and meet energy costs through a combination of monetary supports as well as investment to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock. The household benefits package comprises the electricity or gas allowance and the free television licence, and is just one of a range of supports my Department provides to assist people with their fuel costs. My Department will spend approximately €273 million this year on household benefits, supporting more than 484,000 households. As part of the overall welfare budget package of €600 million in increases that I secured for 2022, I was pleased to be able to increase the fuel allowance payment by €5 per week, effective from budget night. The rate now stands at €33 per week and supports more than 375,000 customers, at an overall cost estimate for 2022 of €366 million. Other payments, such as increases for qualified children, the living-alone allowance and the working family payment, are also shown to be effective in supporting those households who will be most challenged by increases in energy costs. Again, I was pleased to be able to bring forward increases in these payments, valued at €98 million in a full year, as part of budget 2022. Any decision to enhance the household benefits package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of overall budget negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">In addition to the regular weekly and monthly payments, the Department can also support people through the use of discretionary payments, including the exceptional needs payment and a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The recently announced electricity costs emergency benefit payment is a key measure being developed by the Government and led by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, to help mitigate the effects of the recent rise in electricity prices on all domestic customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I thank the Minister. I congratulate her on the excellent work she is doing. As she stated, uniquely, she has made significant changes for the first time in 17 years. The problem we have is recognised by the Government. At the time of the budget, inflation was predicted at 2.2%. It is now in excess of 5%. Regrettably, and through no fault of the Government, many families are choosing between buying food or fuel. That is the reality of the situation. I appreciate the Minister stated it has to be a budgetary matter. If it means a supplementary budget is needed to increase the fuel allowance – I am referring specifically to the household benefit package - to either increase the benefits or reduce the qualification restrictions for it, all Members would support that because it is the right and proper thing to do in a modern democracy faced with the economic challenges we are facing. In light of the high buoyancy in our finances at the moment, let us spend that on the ordinary people who need it now.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">I provided the across-the-board increases and, in addition, targeted measures to support the most vulnerable, based on recommendations by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice. The budget increased the fuel allowance, the living-alone allowance and the qualified child payment. Of course, we are considering this issue as a Government. Despite what some people say, we are not removed from reality. We see what is happening on the ground and we know the cost of living has gone up. I know people are struggling to meet some of these costs. I have asked my officials to look at what we can do. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are also committed to taking action on this issue. We, as a Government, are committed to looking at what can be done. It does require a whole-of-government approach. Inflation is not just impacting on people on social welfare; it is also impacting on people who are working. This is across the board, so it has to be a whole-of-government approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">I very much welcome the Minister's comments. She has the support of every Member, those of all parties and none, to do what needs to be done. I accept and acknowledge that is her absolute intention. The key point is that older people, as well as those who are sick or disabled, need more heat than younger people do. That is why these schemes are there. If she can increase them, she should do so. I have no issue with a supplementary budget being brought forward if that is needed. I do not know what the alternatives are, other than the Minister doubling the allowances for a certain number of weeks and so on. If that requires a budget, that should be done. We have to reach out to all of those people. The Minister rightly pointed out that everybody is suffering, but the older, poorer or more disadvantaged a person is, the more this issue will proportionately impact on him or her due to reduced income in many respects and increased demand for energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">I understand that old people living alone in particular have additional costs because they only have one income coming in. I accept that. That is why in the past two years since becoming Minister for Social Protection I have increased the living-alone allowance. I have always been of the opinion that it takes the same amount of fuel to heat a house for two people as it does for one person. It is something of which I am very conscious. As I stated, the Government will look at this issue. It is like everything else; there are always difficult choices, but we are certainly committed to examining what we can do. I am going to do what I can in my Department of Social Protection.</p>

Throughout the pandemic, post offices stayed open and continued working under very difficult conditions. Indeed, many of them are part of a shop and many of those shopkeepers stepped up to the plate and delivered groceries to their customers when nobody else could. I know that is what my local post office in the village beside me did. They delivered and helped people and we have to recognise that. My Department and I are very appreciative of the sterling work carried out by post office workers who ensured that a full range of services continued to be delivered to the public through the past two difficult years.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> My Department is the largest customer of An Post. More than 24 million social welfare payments were issued via post offices last year and I was pleased to announce recently that the Department has renewed its contract with An Post for cash payment services for another year. This year, my Department expects to spend approximately €56 million in fees to An Post for over-the-counter cash payments and for postage. Last week, I was pleased to announce that payments for all new jobseeker applications will be dealt with directly in post offices. In the coming months, we will extend these measures to other jobseeker payments. This will bring much-needed footfall into post offices in local communities and it is a clear signal of the commitment of the Government to supporting the network as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_102"> My Department has also actively participated in the Government’s interdepartmental group to explore the potential of a one-stop-shop approach for the delivery of Government offline services. The group is co-chaired by the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communication and Public Expenditure and Reform. I thank postmasters, postmistresses and An Post for their continued efforts to serve our shared customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">Gabhaim buíochas leis an t-Aire. I am delighted to hear of the return of the jobseeker’s payment to the post office system. It is worth putting on record that what happened in the banking sector in rural Ireland is a cause of worry. Services were stripped away and, unfortunately, many banks throughout rural Ireland became untenable. It is very important that we continue to support and bolster any degree of activity that goes on in post offices, from which departmental payments and grants can be administered. Of course, it is very welcome that the Minister is putting in that degree of effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_104"> I thank her for visiting my constituency. I know she has a strong appreciation of the challenges that face the people of rural Ireland. Her home county of Monaghan is in a rural constituency, similar to my constituency of Cork East. It is worth putting on the record that this is a good and positive move and very much to be welcomed.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I thank the Deputy. It was a pleasure to visit his constituency. There are great things happening in Cork. I know he is absolutely committed to his local post offices. He has raised with me previously the need to maintain services there. I was delighted to be able to return the jobseeker's payment to post offices. I met An Post and the Irish Postmasters' Union and spoke to them on this issue, as did the Deputy. This is a service they wanted to bring back because it is about footfall, getting people into towns and villages and making sure post offices are sustainable. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has responsibility for post offices. I know she is working to examine what other services can be provided via the post office network. I am happy to work with her on that. In fact, I am meeting her later this afternoon to discuss the matter and see what we can do.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">15. <b>Deputy Martin Browne</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> her views on the back-to-education allowance guidelines that refuse applications on the basis that the only master's degree that is allowed for the purposes of the allowance is a master's in education; and her views on some unsuccessful applications being advised to give up their education in order to avail of State income supports.

            <p eId="para_109">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle. She has timed this well. Why is the only master's degree allowed for the purposes of the social welfare allowance the master's degree in education? I ask this question because I have been contacted by a mother of two, a lone parent, who, after a period of ill-health, is trying to do right by herself and her boys. However, she has been told to give up her education if she wants to receive any support to keep her family going. This constituent contacted me on this matter to enable the Minister to appreciate the context.</p>

          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_58" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_110">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The back-to-education allowance scheme provides people with a second chance education that will improve their prospects of securing employment. It enables eligible people to pursue approved education courses and continue to receive income support for the duration of a course of study, subject to meeting certain conditions. The provision for the scheme for 2022 is €105.4 million and it is supporting just over 5,500 students.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> The conditions under which the scheme operates are designed to ensure that they address the objective of supporting longer term social welfare customers into employment. It is not intended to provide a basis for a long-duration participation in extended education. Evidence from econometric studies shows that the "lock-in" effect of long-duration return-to-education programmes can exceed the "progression effect", thus impairing employment prospects. This scheme should not be viewed as an alternative to the student grant system.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> The circumstances in which the back-to-education scheme can be approved for postgraduate studies are limited and include a higher diploma in any discipline, a professional master's in education or a master's degree based solely on life experience, where the applicant holds no other third level qualification. I am satisfied with this position as people in possession of a third level qualification have already achieved a high level of academic attainment. The possession of a master's qualification is not regarded as a prerequisite to re-entering the workforce. The appropriate mechanism for supporting students pursuing a master's qualification is through the SUSI grant. I trust this clarifies the position.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinBrowne" eId="spk_59">
            <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_113">The woman in question has been left virtually without income because she is trying to improve her job prospects in order that she can look after her two children. As she is excluded from the back-to-education allowance, she was subsequently told that jobseeker’s allowance will also be pulled, leaving her without any supports for rent, fuel and so on. It is crazy that she is being been told to give up her education if she wants to have any supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> The Minister indicated she wants to have skilled workers in the labour force, yet the only support available for studying for a master’s qualification is for a master's in education. The lady in question wants to transition out of teaching and go into research. The question I ask the Minister to focus on is why these limitations apply and what supports are available to a full-time student with a child in this situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_115"> While I am relating this issue to the case of one individual, others are coming across it too. It is a matter that needs general attention. It is of particular importance to the constituent about whom I am speaking. If she pursues any master’s programme other than a master's in education, she is simply seen as someone who is unwilling to make herself available for work.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">This scheme was originally intended for people who had not completed their secondary education and wanted to get back to work. The Deputy will appreciate that if we were to say that people could get a payment throughout their education cycle, the costs of funding people the whole way through their education would be significant. We consider that people with primary degrees are well-placed to get jobs. There are exceptions such as the higher diploma in education and master’s in education because people cannot become a teacher without these qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> If someone wants to do a master’s degree, he or she should look at the SUSI grant, the support that is intended to help in such circumstances. Many people can work part-time while completing a master’s degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_118"> That is the position. As with all these supports, we must target this grant where we feel it is most needed. I have spoken to my officials about this matter and, to be straight with the Deputy, we do not intend to change the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">I appreciate what the Minister is telling us but there are anomalies in everything. It seems the unique position of single parents is being ignored here. A mother who has dependants and wants to further her education for the benefit of her children is being prevented from doing so by criteria that were not designed for people in her situation. For a representative of the Department of Social Protection to advise people in her position to give up their education if they want to maintain their supports is outrageous and it needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> This constituent is packing her master’s course into one year. It is due to end in August but the two arms of the State which matter here, social protection and higher education, are preventing her from doing this. There is no back-to-education allowance or jobseeker's payment available to her and under the SUSI payment, she receives the adjacent rate for the sake of 500 m. She is well aware that she will never own her own home and will have to rent for life but the demands of the system will make this as difficult as possible on her. We hear constantly of the need for a skilled workforce, yet lone parents are being treated in this disgraceful way.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> My constituent has appealed the decision to withdraw the jobseeker’s allowance but was told by the Minister’s office that she had not raised any contentions in her appeal to warrant a change in direction. For her and her family, and other families out there, and especially given that she is looking after her child on her own, I urge the Minister to address this issue and examine the anomalies.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">My Department's allocation of €96.5 million for 2021 has been increased to €105.4 million for 2022. This is a considerable investment in supporting participants to acquire the necessary education and skills to re-enter the labour market. Giving those who already have a degree further supports to obtain a master’s qualification, other than in the exceptional circumstances I mentioned, would create a situation where we end up funding everybody who wants to do a master’s degree. We consider that where people have a third level degree, that should allow them access to the labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I thank the Deputy for asking this question. The programme for Government commits to introducing a pensions automatic enrolment system. The objective of this commitment is to increase the proportion of employees in Ireland with supplementary pension cover, which includes both occupational and personal pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> According to figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the rate of supplementary pension coverage is around 56% of the working population. This is based on the Pension Coverage Survey 2021. It is estimated that this figure reduces to less than 35% when the private sector is considered in isolation. As a consequence of this low supplementary pension coverage rate, many retirees may suffer an unwanted reduction in living standards when they retire.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> The Government, recognising the exceptional strain that both employers and employees are under as a result of the Covid-19 emergency, will seek to gradually deliver an automatic enrolment system. This will be based on the following principles: there will be a phased roll-out over a decade of the contributions made by workers and employers; matching contributions will be made by both workers and employers and the State will top up those contributions; there will be an opt-out provision for those who choose to opt out; workers will have a range of retirement savings products to choose from; and there will be a charges cap imposed on pension providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> My Department has finalised a proposal on the overall design of the auto-enrolment system and I intend to bring that to Government for formal approval very soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">Once the final design is agreed it is intended that the necessary legislative organisation and process structures for implementation will follow over the course of this year and next, as set out in the economic recovery plan for 2021. I hope that I have clarified the matter for the Deputy. </p>
            <p eId="para_135">
						</p>
            <p eId="para_136"><b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan:</b> From the interest shown to date by the employers and employees, is the Minister satisfied that adequate progress is being made, that sufficient interest is being generated and that the scheme will meet its anticipated targets in due course? </p>

            <p eId="para_137">As we know, the State pension provides a basic level of income and an effective protection against pensioner poverty. It is not designed or intended to secure full pension adequacy for all retirees in the sense of replacing employment income on retirement. One does have a situation where people have a sudden drop in their income and that is where one needs to have a supplementary pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> Only 35% of private sector employees have a pension. The fear is that when those people reach retirement they will have a huge reduction in their living standards so I am going to bring a proposal to Government, in February, to finalise the design of the auto-enrolment system. People will have to sign up to the auto-enrolment system and the employee, employer and the Government will all contribute towards it. I am trying to design the system so that it is fair and attractive. The system must be attractive so people will want to enter into it because I know that when I was in my late 20s and early 30s a pension was far from what I was interested in. Instead, I was interested in getting a deposit on a house.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">Again, the emphasis must be on generating and retaining interest in the system. It is true that inadequate provision has been made in many cases. Is it possible to take into account the emergency need to ensure that those who have no provision become involved in their own interest at the earliest possible date to cover the age group to which the Minister has just referred?</p>

            <p eId="para_140">Yes. Everybody will have to sign up to the system and people will get the choice to opt out at certain stages. We have looked at international experience and, in general, when people sign up for a pension most of them continue. Some younger people will think that if they have saved money and put it into a pension pot for five or six years that they should be allowed access the money. I believe that there is no point having a pension pot and accessing it in order to pay a deposit on a house. I know that dipping into the pension pot sounds very attractive but there is no point in doing that and we must make a pension scheme attractive. We have done a lot of work in the Department on pensions. I have brought a proposal to a Cabinet committee and I will bring it to Government in February because we just have to get on with it and do something about pensions. I am very conscious of the need and I want to do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_143">My Department understands the many pressures faced by customers and always seeks to ensure that claims are handled quickly and efficiently. I am pleased to report that claim processing is up to date with processing targets met, or exceeded, on average for all the main scheme areas. As an example, over the past two years substantial improvements in processing performance was achieved across most schemes but especially in the carers and disability areas, where claims are now consistently processed within four to five weeks, compared with 14 weeks in 2019. I am particularly pleased that the positive processing times have been maintained through the period of the pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_144"> My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all customers and ensuring that claims are processed as quickly as possible. Any backlogs arising are addressed without delay through a range of measures, including system changes and the allocation of additional resources where needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> While there have been high volumes of Covid enhanced illness benefit applications over the past month as a result of the transmission of the omicron variant, 92% of these applications are being processed within a week. Applications that require a manual intervention are taking approximately two weeks to process but my officials are working hard to minimise any delays. There are no backlogs arsing in respect of standard illness benefit applications. Delays can arise where a person submits an application without all of the necessary supporting documentation. It is important that anyone applying for social welfare payments should provide as much information as possible when sending in a claim as this will enable a decision to be made much more quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> Overall, I am very proud that my Department continues to ensure that the customer experience has not been diminished by the effects of Covid-19, and that the customer service has been maintained at a high level. </p>

            <p eId="para_149">For the record, the staff of the Department of Social Protection have processed over 1.8 million applications for the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, alone during the Covid pandemic. There is normally about 200,000 applications per annum for the jobseeker's allowance. We have all acknowledged the good work that my staff have done and it is important that we do not forget that my staff have processed ten years' worth of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_150"> The Deputy has raised the issue of oral hearing and appeals before with me. I know that he has a keen interest in them. I also know that he does a huge amount of work, on behalf of his constituents, in terms of helping them. Sometimes oral hearings can be nerve-racking for the applicant and I know that the Deputy is always there to help his constituents. We have improved the times. I think that the Deputy has one case with me at the minute and my Department is looking into it. If the Deputy has an issue that he wants me to raise then I am happy to follow up the matter. </p>

            <p eId="para_151">I thank the Minister. Huge improvements have taken place and huge volumes of responsibility have been taken on, and discharged, in an exemplary manner. I thank and congratulate the Minister and her officials on that work.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> I have long had an interest in oral hearings. It is important that we get them up to speed as quickly as possible and I know that the Minister is attending to that at the moment. The important feature of oral hearings is that they give constituents an opportunity of having their say face to face. Most often, information is revealed that was either overlooked previously or was in the system but was not in the right place at the right time. An oral hearing gives people their full constitutional rights in an upfront face-to-face situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">The Deputy is right. It is hard to beat a face-to-face interaction. Many times applications are turned down because all of the information has not been provided and perhaps people are unaware that it was an important piece of information that would help make a decision on their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_154"> We were able to do some oral hearings and appeals online during the Covid pandemic. We continue to use new technology to make our systems more efficient. As the Deputy has said, oral hearings are important. I do not have the figure for the number of hearings that are currently in the system with me and I will get that figure for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">It is important we do that and that our customers are looked after and served in a timely and efficient way.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">Things went a bit faster than I anticipated. What are the plans of the Minister and the Department to address the findings and conclusions of the Indecon report on the cost of disability published a number of months ago?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_81" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_159">The cost-of-disability research is significantly broader than income supports and it is clear that the findings in the research will have implications for many areas of public policy, including the delivery of care services, health, housing, education, transport and income supports. These relevant Departments have been requested to examine the work they are currently committed to undertaking and review these in the light of the cost-of-disability report. Furthermore, they have been asked that any future actions would also be considered in the context of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_160"> It is very important that these actions are monitored closely right across the whole of government. The national disability inclusion strategy provides the overarching framework for policy and actions relating to people with disabilities. The Government has decided that the cost-of-disability report is to be referred to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which will take responsibility for monitoring actions taken by Departments on foot of the research. This steering group, which as the Deputy knows is ably chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, is the most appropriate forum in which actions arising from the report can be driven forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> I am keen to address the concerns raised by the people who live with the daily reality of disability and I, along with my Government colleagues, will use the results of the research to inform potential measures to address these concerns. From the perspective of my Department, it is worth noting a number of measures were introduced as part of budget 2022 for people with disabilities and their carers that will go towards alleviating the financial costs experienced. These include a combination of core weekly payment rate increases, increases in earnings disregards and supports to employers. Furthermore, under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, my Department has a commitment to develop and consult on a "strawman" proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments. I have asked my officials to revisit the strawman proposal to take on board the findings in the cost of disability research.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_162">I thank the Minister and acknowledge that the report requires a whole-of-government perspective and support. I also acknowledge that it has been referred to the national disability inclusion steering group for further work.</p>
            <p eId="para_163"> The report confirms what was widely suspected but perhaps not acknowledged, which is that the cost of disability is quite significant. The cost of disability amounts to the extra spending that a person with a disability must face in daily life that able-bodied people do not have to face. It is the same for a family with a member with a disability. This report puts the average additional cost of disability to a person with a severe disability at between €9,600 and €12,300. For a person with a less severe disability, the cost is between €8,700 and €10,000. These are averages so clearly there are some people and families spending a lot more than that. The cost depends on the severity of the disability and where the person resides. There are also unmet costs for many as they are currently unaffordable. Looking at some aspects of the report, it indicates this country spends the fourth-least of its social protection budget on disabilities in a comparison with 31 other European countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">Dealing with the cost of disability requires a whole-of-government approach. The reform of disability payments will take on board the recommendations of the report and it is clear a whole-of-government response is needed. There are recommendations in respect of housing, health, education, transport and others, and from a social protection perspective one of the recommendations is a payment linked to disability. The Deputy knows that currently it is a flat rate of €208 whether a person has a mild, moderate or profound disability. Some people with a mild disability could do some work, as we know, and there are others with a profound disability who cannot work at all. Should the payment be graduated? That is something we must look at and we should examine if a person should get more if he or she has a profound disability rather than a mild disability.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulineTully" eId="spk_84">
            <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_165">I acknowledge there has been an increase in the weekly payment and weekly disregard but we can see how rapidly the cost of living has increased. The increases in the weekly payments and disregards do not even cover that cost-of-living increase. We have a very poor record of employment for disabled people in this country and more support must be provided for people to support themselves. Perhaps, for example, we can revise the current timeframes for reducing social welfare supports for people going back to work or engaging in self-employment. Perhaps we could introduce appropriate training tailored to the individuals, as training for an able-bodied person would be different from that of a disabled person. It may take longer because of quicker onset of tiredness or whatever.</p>
            <p eId="para_166"> Many disabled people do not take up community employment schemes. If they do, they get the equivalent payment with a €20 top-up, which is fine, but when they revert back to disability payments it is not a seamless process and it can sometimes take months for the payment to be rectified. It is something that could easily be looked at. I do not understand why that happens. We should be encouraging more people to take up employment opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">I agree with the Deputy that we must help more people with disabilities get back to the workforce. That is very important. I worked to extend the Ability programme last year. That was funded through the EU and funding was due to finish but I met the appropriate people and ensured the Dormant Accounts Fund could support this excellent programme. I was given an outline of what the programme does and it really is fantastic work. They are working with people with disabilities and employers. They are getting people back to work. EmployAbility also provides a great service and it is a question of how we can build on that. As I have said, we will work across government to improve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_168"> We will certainly take the Deputy's points on board, particularly on the report commissioned by my Department. The steering group is looking at it and there are a number of different options we need to look at.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">I am very much aware of the National Advisory Council for Children and Young People's position paper on child poverty, which I published on my Department's website last week, along with the final Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, annual report and updated indicator set. I had excellent engagement with the advisory council on the issue, and I met with them in December specifically on the child poverty paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> The Deputy will be aware that it is the Department of Social Protection that leads on the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020-2025, aimed at reducing poverty, including child poverty, and improving social inclusion. Last September I circulated the advisory council's paper to the BOBF consortium, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, requesting them to give detailed consideration to the recommendations in the context of their budget 2022 discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_179"> In respect of the council's recommendation to give voice to children experiencing poverty, my Department has published a request for tenders seeking methodological advice on hearing the voices of children who are in poverty. I have also met with the Ombudsman for Children regarding his A Better Normal report on child poverty and child homelessness. The Deputy will be aware that we have discussed that paper in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_180"> In budget 2022, I secured additional funding within my Department to reduce childcare costs for parents and to reform the national childcare scheme to positively impact on children in socio-economically disadvantaged communities and, on services with high concentrations of families from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien's, officials and mine are in contact with regard to a new target for child poverty under the roadmap for social inclusion, and identifying a programme of work to address child poverty under the successor framework. I will meet with the Minister of State later this month on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_181"> I will shortly bring the draft EU child guarantee national action plan to Government. The plan addresses a number of critical matters: securing free access to early childhood education and care; education; and healthcare for children in need. As part of this process, and in developing the successor national policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I will continue to engage with my Cabinet colleagues to pursue a coherent agenda on child poverty. A key part of that will be the Better Outcomes, Better Futures successor strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_182">I thank the Minister. I wanted to ask this question so we could raise the issue of child poverty. Whenever we get the opportunity to highlight it, I believe that we should. The Minister will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has also been considering the issue of child poverty. Representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul were recently before the committee to discuss access to food and people still being hungry. It struck me when one of the witnesses said that in 2022 we still have children going to school hungry and coming home hungry. Food poverty is a key part of this. I am aware that the school meals programme comes under the remit of the Department of Education and perhaps this is where things sometimes fall down in this Chamber, which can happen when matters come under different Departments. I wanted to raise the issue of food poverty in particular but also childcare. My time is ticking, however, so I will come back to the childcare question later.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">It is always very important that we would address the issue of child poverty in this House. With regard to the specific elements of food poverty, the Deputy will be aware that in last year's budget and this year's, the free school meals programme was broadened. This is probably the most practical step we can take to provide immediate sustenance to young children and to support their education. Further to that, the Minister for Education has announced a broadening of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme, which again will provide greater supports for children in the most disadvantaged schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_184"> It is also worth noting that we discussed child poverty when we both came into these roles 18 months ago. There was a big concern that with Covid we would see a big spike. The child poverty figures released for 2020, which is the latest we have from December of last year, actually showed a drop. Some 14,000 children came out of child poverty, which is a 1.2% drop. It is a small drop but it does show that the measures we took during the Covid pandemic, with the additional supports, did work. That spike we all feared did not happen and we actually had a decrease.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_185">That is a good argument for keeping some of those additional measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_186"> We hear all of the time that childcare is one of the key issues. I am aware there has been increased investment, and that there is a plan for a joint labour committee, JLC, which is all very welcome, but we also need to keep the focus on as much investment as possible. We know it is mainly women who are affected by that issue, many of whom are the head of a single-parent household and they are affected by poverty more than other households.</p>
            <p eId="para_187"> The school meals programme is excellent. If possible we should look at widening it. It should not just be for DEIS schools. There are kids in non-DEIS schools who would also need that. I just wanted to raise the issue and I believe that we really need to keep a focus particularly on areas such as food poverty and childcare. These are really practical ways we can help families out of poverty. It is not good to have to say that in 2022 people in the State is relying on food banks. Perhaps there could be a little bit more joined-up thinking on these issues. I acknowledge that some of this falls to the Department of Education, with regard to school meals but it also falls to the Department<b>
							</b>of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">The joined-up element is very important. The successor strategy to the Better Outcomes, Better Futures will have a significant child poverty focus within it. As a subset of this we will also have the EU child guarantee, which is guidance, support and some financial support coming from the European Union. The child guarantee and the actions we will take there will sit within the wider Better Outcomes, Better Futures work. That joined-up element is very important and this is why I am engaging very closely, in the first instance with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, and then with the Ministers for Social Protection and Education and other Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_189"> The Deputy is correct regarding childcare. This is why we took steps in this year's budget with regard to the removal of the wraparound hours, which will have a major impact on children in the most disadvantaged areas. The Deputy and I, along with other Deputies, have had significant discussions on this since I came into this role. We have taken the major step whereby 5,000 children will benefit from not having the wraparound hours removed from their free childcare allocation from this spring. That is a major step forward. </p>

            <p eId="para_192">I firmly believe, like the Deputy, that the rate of pay in the sector should reflect the value of the work that early-years educators and school-age childcare practitioners do for children, for families, for society and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_193"> The most recent available data, from the annual early years sector profile survey, indicate that the average hourly wage in the sector in 2021 was €12.60, which is below the living wage, with many staff working part time or on temporary contracts. This is not sustainable and is not acceptable. I am very conscious of the need for significant improvement in both pay and conditions across the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_194"> As the Deputy will be aware, the State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels or determine working conditions for staff in the sector. I am, however, doing all I can to address the issue. In December 2020, I set up a process to examine how we could regulate pay and conditions in the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a joint labour committee, which began meeting in December 2021 and which, hopefully, will result in an employment regulation order. With that order, supported by the new core funding stream I announced in budget 2022, there is now a real prospect of improvement in pay rates through the joint labour committee. The scale of allocation under the new core funding is significant. It is €69 million in 2022, equivalent to more than €207 million in a full year, and it will enable employers to meet the new pay scales coming from an employment regulation order.</p>
            <p eId="para_195"> In December 2021, I published Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, which includes commitments to deliver career pathways, promote careers in the sector, and strengthen supports for continuing professional development. The Government and I are fully committed to ensuring that childcare professionals are properly paid. We have created the mechanism to deliver that through the joint labour committee. We have also delivered the funding to deliver it through the €69 million provided for in this year's budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">I thank the Minister for his response. He will be aware that more than 30,000 people are employed in the childcare sector, most of whom are female. The minimum qualification they hold at the moment is FETAC level 5. Ireland has some of the most highly-rated qualified professionals who are paid some of the lowest wages in any sector, some below the living wage.</p>
            <p eId="para_197"> The types of people who go into childcare are fantastic, with graduates moving into the sector at the moment. While the Minister might say that his Department may not have responsibility for certain issues, we just need a commitment from him that he will help to implement new pay scales, develop the profession and make it more feasible for people to get into the profession.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">I ask for a commitment from the Minister to implement better pay scales, to help develop the profession and to make it more feasible for people to join the profession. I firmly believe that we are not paying the proper money. I have met many parents and the most important thing for them is that their child is safe and properly looked after. For me, childcare is a vocation for the people who work in the sector. They need to be looked after better.</p>

            <p eId="para_199">The Deputy has my commitment to deliver on a better pay scale. I think I have demonstrated that by the €67 million that we are providing specifically for that in this year's budget. In a full year that will grow to €207 million. That is a firm commitment. The Deputy also has my commitment to develop the profession. That is demonstrated through the workforce development plan that I published in December and that my Department will be working to implement. We are not just talking about policies anymore. The Government has put a very substantial amount of money on the table to help facilitate that joint labour committee process. I do not set the pay rates. We have to let that process of negotiation work between the employers and employees. We facilitated the start of that process and we gave a very clear indication of the Government's intention to support it and, most important, to support the increased levels of wages by specifically allocating money to help employers pay better wages.</p>

            <p eId="para_200">My biggest concern is that there is no job security. There is no professional progression. The workers are being paid the minimum wage and many of them are being paid below the living wage. As I said, most of these families entrust their children to the childcare workers. The childcare sector has been underfunded for many years and as a result, Ireland is ranked as the lowest country in the EU for investment in this vital area. The Government needs to invest in the area. We need to get the right people looking after our children. It is very important that we do this right.</p>
            <p eId="para_201"> An expert group was set up back in 2019. I ask the Minister provide me with an update on what is happening with that group. It was supposed to examine the issue of funding and the Minister mentioned a figure in relation to that. We need to get the right people into the childcare profession. My biggest fear, with the current shortage in staff, is that these people may be persuaded to go elsewhere. We need proper professionals in the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">I thank the Deputy. The expert group reported in December. We are now implementing its findings. The first part of that is the substantial additional allocation of funding this year of €69 million. That is the first step towards that, but there are other elements in terms of introducing a DEIS-type model for childcare and broadening out the national childcare scheme, NCS. We took a small step in that in this year's budget. In next year's budget, budget 2023, we will seek to invest considerably more in the NCS, which will also reduce costs for parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_203"> The Deputy rightly put the focus on childcare professionals, and there is a lot to be done in that regard. However, we also need to reduce costs for parents. I think everybody agrees on that point. Getting back to the issue of providers, the Deputy is right that we have not supported childcare professionals enough in the past. However, we have the workforce development plan and we have funding to support improved rates of pay through the JLC. Childcare providers will also benefit from the new sick pay scheme introduced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Therefore, very significant advances to support childcare professionals are being made.</p>

            <p eId="para_206">I am aware that this matter is one of importance to the Deputy and to other Members of the House who have also raised questions about refuge provision in counties Cavan and Monaghan with me and my predecessors. I know there is strong interest locally. I have recently received correspondence from Cavan County Council in this regard. The response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, is a cross-departmental and multi-agency issue. It is co-ordinated by the Department of Justice. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, provides supports for victims of domestic violence, primarily funded through NGO service providers. In 2021, Tusla allocated €28 million in core funding for DSGBV, plus €2 million in contingency funding to address Covid challenges. In 2022, the allocation will be €31 million, amounting to a €3 million increase in core funding. Funding in 2022 will support services to address cost pressures and maintain continued services, including core sustainability costs and the ongoing supportive initiatives commenced in 2021. The additional allocation will also fund the beginning of the implementation of the accommodation review.</p>
            <p eId="para_207"> I am informed by Tusla that support for victims of DSGBV in counties Cavan and Monaghan is available through the services of Tearmann, which is based in County Monaghan and funded by the Tusla. Tearmann also provides outreach services in both counties. Tusla funded Tearmann in 2021 to the value of €214,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_208"> The Tusla review of the provision of accommodation for victims of domestic violence has assessed the current and requisite distribution of safe emergency accommodation. It has examined the current level of refuge provision, evidence of demand for service, unmet need and the analysis of proximity to refuges by local communities. The review has been completed and publication is expected in the next two weeks. The Government will be guided by the recommendations of the review. I expect the implementation process for the review will identify priority areas where there is the greatest need for providing safe accommodation for victims of DSGBV. I am very keen to see the gap in geographic coverage in counties Cavan and Monaghan being addressed. I hope to see the accommodation review used as the vehicle to make progress and address that gap.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">One of the main reasons many women do not leave an abusive relationship is the shortage of available and affordable accommodation that could rehouse a victim of domestic abuse at short notice. According to the Council of Europe, it is recommended that there be one refuge place per 100,000 people, which means there should be 446 places in Ireland. Currently, there are 137, which is ten less than four years ago. We signed up to the Istanbul Convention. Why sign up to a convention if we are not going to implement it?</p>
            <p eId="para_210"> In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, there is no refuge place and there has not been one historically. I welcome that the issue is being addressed and I am hopeful that progress will be made in the very near future. I recognise the tremendous work that Tearmann does in the two counties. There are only two or three members of staff employed in that service and they do a lot of outreach work.</p>
            <p eId="para_211"> According to Safe Ireland, 808 requests for refuge could not be met last year. As we know, the nature of an abuser is to isolate the victim from family and support. Victims go to a refuge seeking support because they do not have anywhere else to go. I shudder to think where such victims find support or what they have to do as a result. Perhaps they have to go back to the violent perpetrator.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">There is absolutely no doubt that we do not have enough refuge spaces in this country. No one disputes that fact. That is why the accommodation review was undertaken to outline where the gaps are and where the lack of coverage and availability of spaces is most acute. It was undertaken to identify the areas where there are communities, families, primarily women, fleeing abusive situations, who have to travel very long distances to find refuge. I have no doubt that when the review is published, it will illustrate what the Deputy and her colleagues know, namely, that there is a very substantive gap in coverage in counties Cavan and Monaghan. That is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_213"> As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I briefed Opposition leaders, including the Deputy's party leader, last week on this issue. We outlined that there is a substantive change under way. Responsibility for refuge provision is moving from my Department and Tusla to the Department of Justice. All responses to DSGBV will be run through the Department of Justice, including the implementation of the accommodation review.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">I welcome that the issue will be the responsibility of one Minister. We know that what is needed to tackle domestic violence and violence against women is a multipronged approach. It is very welcome that one Minister will be able to choreograph all of that. It is scary. We are all aware of the recent death of Ashling Murphy. Almost every week, the newspapers report that a woman has been murdered or a case is being heard in court. Domestic violence is a scourge and a pandemic. The Garda reported that it responded to almost 50,000 domestic incidents last year, which amounted to a 10% increase on the year before. That figure only relates to incidents that were reported. The need for refuges in Cavan and Monaghan and the other seven counties that do not have one could be addressed immediately to support women who need to get out of dangerous situations to save their lives and stay alive.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">The significant change that is being made in moving the responsibility for refuges and other services to the Department of Justice is one advocacy groups and the NGOs working in the sector have been calling for for a long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">We ran this audit and it became clear that this was the call from the sector. We are implementing that now. That is important. Even though responsibility in this area is moving out of Tusla, in the time that I have been Minister, we have significantly increased investment in Tusla in respect of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. We put in an extra €2.7 million in budget 2021 and an extra €3 million in budget 2022. We have recognised this epidemic of violence against women, as the Deputy and, indeed, the programme for Government describe it. We have put in place significant additional funding for services, both core funding and Covid contingency funding. The next step is the provision of that additional refuge space. The accommodation review will allow us to focus on that and to bring forward mechanisms to, as the Deputy has put it, swiftly deliver the new refuges.</p>

            <p eId="para_219">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to bring the House up to date. The report, The Cost of Disability in Ireland, was commissioned by the Minister for Social Protection and prepared by Indecon International Research Economists. It was published in December 2021 and provides importance evidence as to the additional costs that people with disability face in their day-to-day lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_220"> The programme for Government contains a commitment to use research into the cost of disability to properly inform the direction of future policy. As the evidence of The Cost of Disability in Ireland report has implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government approach is required to develop appropriate and timely responses and to ensure that everyday costs are reduced for people with disabilities and their families. </p>
            <p eId="para_221"> For this reason, the co-ordination of the whole-of-government response is being carried out under the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS. The NDIS is one of two national policy frameworks through which the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland are progressively realised. In addition to advancing key actions under the NDIS, my Department supports the implementation and monitoring of the NDIS by co-ordinating the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, NDISSG. I chair this group and its meetings are attended by representatives of Departments, agencies and the disability stakeholder group, the DSG 6.</p>
            <p eId="para_222"> The Cost of Disability in Ireland report was considered by the NDISSG in December 2021, within 24 hours of publication. I was very fortunate in that the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Humphreys, and I actually attended the presentation from all stakeholders. The group will examine meaningful action to reduce day-to-day costs for people with disabilities in Ireland. Aligning the findings and recommendations of The Cost of Disability in Ireland report to the NDIS will ensure that recommendations can be properly considered at whole-of-government level and that progress against actions taken will be monitored. We meet every three months. There is going to be a traffic-light system implemented and we will see the progress every quarter.</p>

            <p eId="para_223">I thank the Minister of State. We are all aware of the extra costs people face because of disability. Some of these are once-off costs and some are yearly but largely they are day-to-day and week-to-week costs. This report mentions everything from housing adaption costs to hearing aids, travel costs, utility bills, home help and so on. There is really good analysis of these extra costs in the report. For example, the extra cost in respect of food is almost 9%. For fuel and light, it is almost 10% and, for household durable goods, nearly 20%. The report goes through these issues and tells us the types of extra costs people face. It says that the average is approximately €8,000 per annum but that varies depending on the disability involved. For certain types of disability, for example, visual impairment, the extra costs total €13,500. We know what the issues are and we know the costs. I am asking what steps we are taking right now.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">If the Deputy were to ask me what is happening right now, I would say that all of the Departments are looking at the cost of disability. She has quite rightly identified that the extra costs faced by people with a disability vary depending on the disability. However, there is a standard-of-living cost as well. A person who has a prosthetic may face extra costs of €20,000, depending on whether their medical card will cover these costs. It might, but it might not cover the cost of the prosthetic they require. It might not meet the needs of a child undergoing two or three growth spurts in a year. That is one of the elements. The other element that was really interesting in the report was how expensive it is for the families of children with challenging behaviours or autism spectrum disorder, ASD, to get extra care and so on. That is being looked at. It is being divided and compartmentalised. Each Department will come back in March with its own suggestions as to what exactly it is going to do.</p>

            <p eId="para_225">This is obviously a work in progress. I will bring two further issues to the Minister of State's attention. The first relates to the Housing for All strategy. Within that, there is a strategy for persons with disabilities. It tells us things like disabled people will be at the centre of decision-making. That sounds fine but the question is how is that done and how is it managed? Does the Minister of State have any thoughts as to how she believes that will work?</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> The other specific issue relates to the ongoing review of the primary medical certificate system. All of us will get emails, if not every week then certainly every month, from people who are trying to access a primary medical certificate. It is extraordinarily difficult to get a primary medical certificate. A review is ongoing. What progress is being made in that regard? I believe it is looking at expanding the range of conditions for which a person can access these certificates.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">With regard to the Housing for All strategy, there will, of course, be a stakeholder group involved. Persons with a disability will be at the total and utter centre of that. It is they who will be telling us about universal design, that is, design that ensures that the social housing stock we develop will meet the changing needs of those who will come in and out of those properties. Particularly with regard to disabilities, these needs are always changing. We need to future-proof the housing stock. I am working with various Deputies, including Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure this. I see that Deputy Hourigan is behind me. She is assisting me with the plans in respect of universal design.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">In December of last year, I announced a €10 million grant programme to improve ventilation and reduce the transmission of Covid-19 in early learning and childcare settings. This provided services with grants ranging from €1,500 to €4,500. The rental or purchase of HEPA filters is among the items of eligible expenditure under this grant programme and guidance has been provided on the HEPA filters that are suitable for use in childcare settings. The grant programme opened for applications on 16 December. The original closing date of 7 January 2022 but we extended it to 31 January 2022 so that as many services as possible could avail of this grant. Some 4,109 services have now applied the grant which means that 95% of eligible services have made an application.</p>
            <p eId="para_234"> That €10 million grant programme is just part of a suite of supports provided to the early learning and childcare sector since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other supports include tailored funding arrangements during periods of closure and restricted access to services, a range of capital programmes, an antigen programme, sector-specific infection prevention and control guidelines and access to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, with an exemption to the turnover rule. The provision of the EWSS at the full rate is equal to an investment of €34 million per month. The value of EWSS at standard rates is equal to an investment in the sector of €22 million per month. That additional money has allowed for sector-specific public health guidance to be implemented. The most important aspect of this is the play pod system that has been implemented since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">There is strong evidence that these Covid-19 supports are helping and supporting the early learning and care sector. Recent Tusla data show that the number of early learning and childcare settings that closed completely decreased significantly in 2021 compared with the previous two years. Data from the Revenue Commissions show that the number of staff employed in the sector has held steady. HSE data show that the rates of transmission within early learning and childcare settings have remained low compared with rates of community transmission.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">There is one vital piece of information I do not think was contained in the Minister's answer and that I would be interested in getting, that is, how many of the crèches and other childcare facilities have HEPA filters installed. That is key information the Government and the Minister absolutely must have. We know from Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HSPC, figures released this week that there were 251 outbreaks of Covid in childcare settings during waves 4 and 5 and that seven of those outbreaks took place in the first four weeks of this year. The figures I have got from the hospitals state that in Temple Street hospital there are 25 children under five compared with nine children aged five to 11 and that in Crumlin there are 60 children aged between zero and five compared with 24 between six and 11. We know that temperatures are likely to drop again in winter. In circumstances in which there is no filtration, the only protection people have is to have the windows wide open, whereas with filtration systems the windows still need to be open but can be open less wide and for a shorter time while maintaining minimum temperatures.</p>

            <p eId="para_237">I do not have the specific figure for the number of HEPA filters. I will speak to my Department and see if we can get that figure to the Deputy as quickly as possible. This grant scheme was designed specifically to deal with the issue of ventilation. We know that providers were very interested and had been in touch with my Department to see how we could facilitate them. We facilitated them with this very significant grant. As the Deputy will have seen from the figures I have cited to him, there has been a very significant take-up of the grant. I believe providers will have gone out to source and implement this in respect of the guidance my Department has provided as to what is the right type of filter and what is the right scale and size of filter for the particular settings each provider has, recognising the very different sizes and scales of settings around the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">It seems to me that the fact the Minister does not have the figures illustrates the problem with this approach of establishing a grant and then crèches and crèche operators having to jump through various hoops to get the grant and then install the filters, as opposed to simply going out and saying this is important and that the Department will centrally purchase the appropriate number of HEPA filters needed and then distribute them into the facilities across the country. Can the Minister at least reassure me some HEPA filters have been installed under this grant scheme? I know that in respect of schools, for example, a couple of weeks ago a similar grant scheme was in operation and not a single HEPA filter had been installed as a consequence. The principals said that was a long bureaucratic process and that it would be the summer before they got there. Is the same hampering the roll-out under this scheme in the crèches?</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> The final point I will make is the importance of long Covid. We know that about 10% of people get long Covid. Obviously, many of them will recover from that, but it can affect children particularly, which means it is vital we do everything we can to protect children as well as staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_240">We have taken very extensive measures to protect children, and the grant we provided this December is not the first grant. A €5 million outdoor play grant was provided in June of last year, and just short of €30 million was provided for a reopening grant in August 2020, around the time I entered this role, to support the reopening of services following the initial large-scale closure. Very significant capital grants have been provided to childcare facilities all over the country to make them ready and to make those services safe, and I know providers have implemented that. I have been in childcare facilities. I have seen the differences, the screens and the various provisions that have been put in place. I have spoken to some providers in my own constituency about the HEPA filter grant. They appreciated that additional support and the extra security and public health safety it provided. It is not bureaucratic; we have made this available as quickly as possible to providers. That is certainly the response I have got back from them<b>.</b></p>

            <p eId="para_243">I believe that significant advancements can be made through my Department's co-ordination of the EU child guarantee. It is an important initiative which aims to combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> I will publish our national action plan for the child guarantee by March of this year. The commitments under the guarantee address critical matters such as free access to early childhood education; education; healthcare for children in need; healthy nutrition, including a healthy meal each school day; and adequate housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> Tackling child poverty and effectively implementing the child guarantee will require the commitment and active, sustained participation of my colleagues across the Government to make sure it is ultimately impactful. As part of the child guarantee process, and in developing the successor national policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I will engage with my Cabinet colleagues to consider the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children and young people. The child guarantee will form one element of the broader body of work supported by the new national policy framework for children and young people and its implementation structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> On a related note, addressing child poverty was identified as a priority action under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and will remain a priority for its successor framework. Then there is the work being undertaken by the Department of Social Protection. It leads on the roadmap for social inclusion. Under that roadmap, a new child poverty reduction target will be introduced, and I will meet the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, later this month in respect of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> Finally, we will continue to look at those mechanisms to make sure we have a whole-of-government approach. I met with the Ombudsman for Children and we had a good debate about his "new normal" report just before Christmas in this House. There is also the position paper of the national advisory council on child poverty, which is a really useful document. I also wish to make better use of the Cabinet committee on social affairs, particularly pre-budget, allowing a discussion specifically on how our next budget will address child poverty each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_248">I know from previous conversations with the Minister that he is well aware of some of these issues. As for the child guarantee, I am selfishly thinking particularly of my constituency, where we have high numbers of children experiencing homelessness and children who are from migrant families and who sometimes find it difficult to access services. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is very much aware of the issues around disability. Are there aspects of the child guarantee that speak particularly to those vulnerable groups or those groups who require more effort and more thought? How will we tackle that, and is there specific provision for them in the work the Minister is doing?</p>

            <p eId="para_249">Yes, very much so. The child guarantee will be one piece and will sit within the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, successor strategy. The child guarantee is focused on children in need. That is the term used in the EU provision, which refers to the delivery of free childcare, free education and free healthcare to children in need. Obviously, that very much encompasses the groups about which the Deputy talks. There is some EU funding available under the child guarantee, which is particularly beneficial. Once we submit our action plan, we will be able to make applications for targeted programmes that will look to achieve the outcomes set out in that regard. The child guarantee, however, is a slightly narrower element. That is why we are not looking at it alone but, rather, placing it within the BOBF successor strategy, which looks at a broader context of children at risk of poverty and items such as homelessness the Deputy has addressed. That will allow us to address that in a comprehensive way, bringing together all those different Departments. This cannot be just a matter for my Department and the Department of Social Protection; all Departments are involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">I am very heartened to hear of the threading through of issues of child poverty throughout the Minister's statement. I appreciate that housing is not his brief, but we have 2,500 children in emergency accommodation. The cost of rents in particular is rising rapidly, and the cost of living is difficult for families on lower incomes. Will the Minister talk to me a little about what the child guarantee will mean for children?</p>

            <p eId="para_252">The issue of children and young people who are homeless is identified in the programme for Government. There is a commitment to bring forward a strategy in this regard. That will be led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but my Department will also be feeding into it. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I have met on that issue once already and we will seek to do so again. The work being done between our two Departments can be knit into the child guarantee and the successor to the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures strategy, which looks at matters through a wider lens. I do not believe the child guarantee specifically focuses on homelessness but I can come back to the Deputy on that. That is not to say we will not address the absolutely crucial issue of homelessness among children and young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> I got a really interesting paper from Focus Ireland with regard to young LGBT+ people and their particular vulnerability to homelessness. They may encounter particular situations which other sectors of the population may not. The Deputy also made reference to migrant homelessness. There are very specific issues in respect of different vulnerable populations, which may require tailored solutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_256">The national participation framework for children and young people's participation in decision-making was published in April last year. It plays a vital role in ensuring that all children and young people are respected and listened to and that their views are taken on board routinely in the public services offered to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_257"> The framework's implementation is actively supported by my Department through the capacity-building measures and training provided by Hub na nÓg. The hub was established as a centre of excellence and co-ordination to drive and support children and young people's participation in decision-making nationally. In 2021, phase 1 of a capacity-building grant to train staff in the use of the framework was allocated to arts organisations, disability, homelessness and Traveller service providers, the justice sector and early learning and childcare services. A key feature of this €150,000 grant is that funded organisations must also undertake training from Hub na nÓg. That training provides an understanding of the policy commitment to the voice of the child. Practitioners are provided with tools that enable them to involve children and young people in decision-making in their day-to-day services and activities. In 2022, phase 2 of the capacity grant scheme will see sporting organisations and youth services included. </p>
            <p eId="para_258"> Hub na nÓg also continues to engage bilaterally with Government Departments, agencies and key stakeholders. Further methodologies for seldom-heard children and younger children are being developed. Hub na nÓg is also working with academic partners to develop an online training module.</p>
            <p eId="para_259"> The vision of the framework is about participation with purpose. This will ensure that, when young people are involved in decision-making, their views are listened to and given due weight with the intention of influencing the outcome or initiating change. This vision recognises our children as citizens of today and not just as the adults of tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_260">This framework plays a vital role in supporting Departments, agencies and organisations to improve their practices in listening to children and young people and to facilitate their voices being heard in decision-making. Children cannot be the priority if their needs and concerns are not represented by the voices that are being heard. This framework is underpinned by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the national strategy on children and young people's participation in decision-making. Children and young people need to have a meaningful voice in decision-making, not least to help us better develop and evaluate evidence-based policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_261"> Just this week, I raised with an Taoiseach the issue of a child who needed a home adaptation grant because of a disability. The child faced significant barriers because there is no policy in this regard. An assessment was carried out by an adult occupational health therapist when it should have been done by a children's occupational therapist. These are the barriers we seem to be facing. Children are not just small adults; they are developing human beings who deserve to be treated with priority by every Department. Will the Minister detail the progress on the implementation of the national participation framework for children and young people's participation in decision-making since its announcement, particularly as it has now been used across Departments?</p>

            <p eId="para_262">I thank the Deputy for her advocacy on these issues. There are very tangible examples of the youth participation framework acting to influence Government policy. When the climate action plan was being drafted, there was a youth participation strand to get the views of young people on that issue. Similarly, the youth justice policy launched in 2020 is absolutely essential with regard to its application to young people and, again, young people were consulted on the content. To give a very practical example, as the Deputy will know, a new youth travel pass was announced in this year's budget to give a 50% reduction in fares for young people aged between 17 and 23. That was a result of advocacy from Comhairle na nÓg, whose national executive had agreed that would be its policy proposal. It engaged with me and I engaged with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and we brought forward that really positive policy initiative. That is another example of youth participation in action.</p>

            <p eId="para_263">That is welcome. This framework gives a practical way for organisations and Departments to engage with and hear the voice of the child. Everybody has the right to make their own choices and every effort must be made to support people whose capacity to make decisions is a challenge. For children to have that right, they need decision makers who support and hear them. What specific practical supports are being provided to decision makers to help them to develop capacity for meaningful engagement with young people? Is there a plan to extend this?</p>
            <p eId="para_264"> This morning, we have heard different Members speaking about child poverty, homelessness and the school meals programme. Children are going to school hungry. I am aware of parents taking their children out of schools to attend other schools that have the hot meals programme. These are issues that seem to be getting worse. We have to make these issues a priority. We have to make sure that no child faces homelessness or goes hungry.</p>

            <p eId="para_265">The key practical step we are taking is the provision of the €150,000 grant that is available to a whole range of youth organisations to allow them to upskill and train their members, increasing their ability to undertake youth participation. The Deputy has referenced a number of vulnerable groups. That is particularly important. That is the next step. Hub na nÓg is really focusing on not only how to listen to children, but how to listen to Traveller children, very young children and children with a disability to get those very distinct takes and views, which may be different from the views of the average child or young person, and to make sure they are fed into and influence processes and policy decisions taken about those groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_268">As I said in response to an earlier question, I am very conscious of the need for a significant improvement in pay and working conditions in the early learning and childcare sector. The level of pay, which averaged €12.60 per hour in 2021, does not in any way reflect the importance of the work or the skill and expertise required. The consequence of low pay, the high turnover of staff, undermines the quality of children's early learning experiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> My Department has, over a number of years, provided a range of financial supports to providers in the sector to support them to improve pay and conditions. Measures that are still in place include higher rates of capitation payments to services with graduate room leaders in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and to services employing qualified inclusion co-ordinators.</p>
            <p eId="para_270"> In December 2020, I began a process which examined the possibility of regulating pay and conditions through the use of a joint labour committee. That committee has now been established and started meeting in December of last year. To support the joint labour committee in drawing up an employment regulation order to determine minimum rates of pay, I secured a very significant additional investment in budget 2022, fulfilling a key commitment in the programme for Government. There is €69 million available this year and €207 million available in a full year. I hope to see the joint labour committee bring forward its recommendations in the coming months. This would allow us to implement the new pay scales in September of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> I recognise that, this week two years ago, early learning educators, providers and parents were out on the streets protesting conditions in this sector. That protest is being marked tomorrow with a day of recognition and hope. During the Covid pandemic, as a country, we have gained a better appreciation of the great work done by childcare professionals and providers in education for our children and keeping them safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_272">There is much more to be done in this area, but I believe that the measures and policies undertaken by the Government over the past 18 months show our commitment to supporting this essential sector during the Covid-19 pandemic, but also in future. </p>

            <p eId="para_273">The Minister's commitment to the sector will be judged on two measures, namely, the conditions experienced by those working in it and the costs borne by those people bringing their children to childcare facilities. Neither of those two areas has seen any improvement since this Government took office or since those thousands of people came onto the streets two years ago. We must, therefore, speed this process up, and one of my questions specifically focuses on when the Minister is going to publish and outline the new core funding model. Childcare facilities are businesses, and they are also responsible for the care of our young children. In some cases, those are vulnerable young children. Those facilities cannot just turn on a switch in June and change their entire model. The Minister indicated that he has specific funding available in the context of staff and conditions for this year and next year. If it is possible to outline what the funding is going to be, surely then there must also be some idea of when that is going to be rolled out and what it will mean. When will the Minister release the details, including a breakdown, of all the new aspects of the core funding model to enable those people managing and operating childcare facilities to start planning for this new model?</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_274">We have outlined our commitments to fund childcare facilities under the EWSS until the end of April. Providers are aware of the level of funding being provided in that context. From May, June, July and August, we have brought forward a contingency Covid-19 bridging fund, for which €37 million has been provided. It will kick in during those months, and then from September the new core funding will apply. There is, therefore, no question of just turning on a switch in this regard. An extensive and consistent level of funding has been provided for the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_275"> Turning to the specific question regarding what the new core funding will look like, we are putting the final elements to the formulas that will deliver the details of what each provider will receive. By the end of March, we will provide a ready reckoner which will enable any childcare facility to enter its details and get an understanding of how much money it will be getting in the following September, assuming that the joint labour committee for the sector is fully working. My Department is continuing to meet with the Youth Forum, and is also communicating directly with the sector to update it about what is happening.</p>

            <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_276">I take it from the Minister's response that those childcare providers I referred to will have the full information by March. I welcome that he expects the JLC process to be complete by then and that the Department will have published the breakdown of how this process will work in future.</p>
            <p eId="para_277"> The next point, then, concerns those people working today in stressful conditions, because childcare facilities are probably one of the last remaining areas where Covid-19 is still having an impact on staff and children. I refer as well to the control mechanisms that must be in place. I am talking, therefore, about people working in stressful conditions and who are also highly qualified, as the Minister acknowledged. These people need certainty. Equally, parents need to know what measures are going to be in place to reduce the substantial childcare costs borne by them day to day and week to week. Will they also have an assurance that by September they can expect to see their fees being reduced?</p>

            <p eId="para_278">The Deputy made several points. By the end of March, childcare services will have a strong understanding of the amount they will be receiving under core funding provision. I cannot tell the Deputy when the JLC process will end; it is independent of me. I hope that it will complete and bring forward the employment regulation order in the spring or early summer so we can continue to implement these measures. We are continuing to support childcare providers. I refer to the work my Department is doing to implement the better pay scales from September of this year, as well as to work done across government on the introduction of sick pay, which is something that has been absent for childcare providers for many years. That measure will be provided under work the Tánaiste is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_279"> Regarding certainty for parents, we have brought in this new commitment that providers who wish to access core funding will not be able to increase their fees in 2022 over and above what they were in 2021. That is the first step in controlling of fees, and that will allow us to address this issue in future budgets. We have a commitment across government to invest further in the NCS in measures that will significantly reduce fees for parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_281">I am taking this question on behalf of Deputy McAuliffe. First 5, a whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to increasing investment in the early learning and care, ELC, service by up to €1 billion by 2028. Can the Minister provide an update on the expert group established to develop a new funding model for the ELC and school age childcare, SAC, services?</p>

            <p eId="para_282">The expert group was established in September 2019 to develop a new funding model for early learning and care and school age childcare. The group was tasked with examining the current model of funding and with considering how additional resourcing could best be structured to achieve a high-quality, affordable, accessible and sustainable sector. The expert group was independently chaired and comprised national and international experts across multiple fields. It met 21 times. The expert group has now completed its work and its report, Partnership for the Public Good, PPG, was published on 7 December 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> Following the Government's consideration and acceptance of its 25 recommendations, work has now commenced on their implementation. I was happy to have the opportunity to meet the chair of the expert group before the Estimates process to allow the emerging recommendations of the group to inform the package of measures announced in budget 2022. We spoke about those earlier. I refer especially to a new core funding stream for services to support improved quality, affordability and sustainability and to support the drawing up of the employment regulation order, which is so important in getting better paper staff. That measure is being introduced. It will be worth €69 million this year, and €207 million in a full year. Participation in core funding will require the services to not increase the fees charged to parents from the rates applied in September 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_284"> Budget 2022 also announced an extension in the age of children eligible to access the universal NCS subsidy and a change in respect of the removal of how wraparound hours for NCS subsidies are determined. These measures were also recommended by the expert group. Budget 2022, therefore, began the implementation of the expert group’s recommendations. The full implementation of all its recommendations will be progressed in the coming years, as additional funding is secured through the annual Estimates process. I again emphasise that there is strong agreement across all three Government parties on the importance of including measures in the next budget to address affordability and provide significant investment in NCS to save parents money.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_285">I thank the Minister. The report issued by the expert group in early September on funding and the Department’s report, Nurturing Skills, were both welcome and timely. Access to affordable early learning and childcare supports a fair society, sustainable communities and a thriving economy. The Minister is acutely aware of the challenges facing parents, childcare professionals and childcare providers, and he is working to address them.</p>
            <p eId="para_286"> I regularly hear from constituents who raise issues concerning the affordability and availability of childcare. One issue that comes up is that those who pay privately pay extraordinary fees. In addition, those who can be subsidised struggle to find a service. Many service providers tell me about issues in respect of building costs, insurance costs and fire safety requirements, while staffing is also a major issue. Equally, many childcare workers tell me how they want to have an opportunity to stay working in the sector and to progress within it as valued employees. </p>
            <p eId="para_287"> I am aware that budget 2022 provided funding to begin the implementation of these recommendations, including €69 million for the new core funding stream from September 2022. This is equivalent to €207 million in a full year. What is the status of the other recommendations contained within the expert group's report? Will the expert group continue to play an oversight or advisory role?</p>

            <p eId="para_288">The Deputy has quickly summarised the huge range of complexities in this sector. These are complexities that we are seeking to address, and we are taking a step-by-step approach to doing that. On the issue of affordability, in this year’s budget we have been able to take a significant step in respect of the extension of the NCS. The 50 cent per hour subvention, which is a part of that scheme and which every parent received for a child aged between zero and three attending childcare, has been extended. In September this year, that subvention will cover those aged from zero to 15. Therefore, any child aged between zero and 15 attending childcare will get a 50 cent subvention per hour. This is a first step, but it is an important one, because all children will now be getting a basic level of subvention from the State for the childcare they receive.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> Turning to the wider recommendations of the expert group, one I am particularly passionate about pursuing is the DEIS-type model and approach to dealing with disadvantage within the early years sector. A range of recommendations has been made and I hope to start to implement some of those measures in budget 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_290">I thank the Minister for his reply. Childcare professionals demonstrated incredible resilience throughout the pandemic in supporting children and keeping the services open.</p>
          </speech>
          <summary eId="sum_7">We have to compliment them on that. They have played a significant role during the pandemic. A new funding model will be a key vehicle to ensuring that such significant additional investments deliver for children, families and the State. I know all Members share the aims of achieving equality for children, affordability for parents, stability for providers and supports for employers, as well as improving pay and conditions for staff. The figures indicate that 42% of early years educators are actively looking for a job outside childcare, with 75% of them identifying low pay as the reason for leaving their profession. These are professionals but many of them only earn €12.40 an hour. A provider told me she would love there to be some kind of individual coaching in the sector to support providers to grow and succeed and achieve their aims as well as those of the Government. What are the next steps for the development of a work plan for the sector?</summary>

            <p eId="para_291">I thank the Deputy for recognising the excellence across the early years professional sector. That excellence is always demonstrated, but was particularly apparent during the Covid pandemic. She rightly identified that far too many early years professionals are seeking to leave the sector and that is primarily due to the issue of pay. There have already been three or four questions today on that issue of pay. I welcome the strong focus of Deputies on the issue. I am sure the sector and childcare professionals welcome it as well. I have outlined the very significantly funded measures the Government is taking to start to address the issue of pay. It does go beyond pay. The Deputy referred to coaching. There has to be a sense for early years professionals, particularly those starting out, that they have a career and a progress path. That is what the workforce development plan I published in December is all about. It is about creating career structures and putting in place supports for continuing professional development, coaching and the like to make sure people can see they have a long-term future in the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_294">I thank the Deputy for her question on what will be a landmark piece of research and data project. I was delighted to announce the project last week after receiving the support of the Government for its commencement. The project comprises a suite of research and data activities that will strengthen our understanding of the lives of children in care and adults who have been in care. This work will provide us with much-needed insights into their experiences and valuable evidence about their outcomes. The project, which is a key priority of mine, will inform the development of effective and responsive policies in my Department and services, but also across government, that best serve the needs of children and young people in the care of the State. It will encompass a ten-year longitudinal study of children transitioning from care, in line with the recommendations of the Ryan report, but will also include other bespoke studies on children in care to complement improved data systems. The project will be led by my Department, with Tusla as a key partner.</p>
            <p eId="para_295"> There are five basic elements to the project. First, there is the development and agreement of a project plan informed by meaningful consultation with stakeholders. We are starting that now. Second, there is ongoing development of the capacity of the national child care information system, NCCIS, in Tusla to track dynamically the individual pathways of children through care. Third, there will be a once-off study of a cohort of children who left care ten years ago in order that we can immediately get some understanding of young adults ten years after care. As I mentioned, there is the longitudinal study, starting with a cohort of children who are aged 16 and then engaging with them for the subsequent ten years of their lives, again looking at outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_296"> The project will facilitate further bespoke research studies on children in care and aftercare where more detailed information is needed about their circumstances. This will complement improved system data and also provide children in care with an opportunity to have their voices heard. Examples of this could be an examination of the reasons for some categories of children being over-represented in the care system.</p>

            <p eId="para_297">I thank the Minister. I am delighted he is delighted, but the report was published in 2009 and here we are, 13 years later. I really would like a timeframe in respect of the research. Who is carrying it out? I am delighted that we are now going to listen to the voices of children. Those voices were never listened to in the past. There are 6,000 children in care. Every year, 500 children come out of the system at the age of 18. Focus Ireland has described this as a cliff edge, with one third of those who have left care being either homeless or at risk of homelessness. Children who were in care are over-represented in the prison system. The Irish Penal Reform Trust found that in 2019 40% of young people in Oberstown Children Detention Campus had been in care or had significant involvement with Tusla. I could highlight any of the figures relating to this issue, but I am wondering why this research is only starting now. I acknowledge that its commencement was recommended well before the time of the Minister. The Ryan report was devastating. It revealed systemic abuse, sexual and physical, at every level in boys industrial schools and so on. This project was one of its practical recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_298">Undoubtedly, the research should have been commenced before now. I could give the Deputy a range of bureaucratic reasons why that did not happen. What is happening, however, is that I have recognised this as an outstanding piece of work and I have prioritised it. I note the welcome that Empowering People in Care, EPIC, and similar groups have given to the announcement by the Government, an announcement that is backed up by funding. The project is structured and it is led by Tusla but it has the engagement of other groups as well in terms of the structure. We are serious about this. That is evident from the fact that we are not just doing the longitudinal study that is so essential, we are also doing the initial research looking now at young people ten years out of care and their outcomes. We are not waiting for the ten-year longitudinal study to go through; we will actually get some information now. It is also about better using the information we have through the NCCIS and allowing that to shape policy in the short term while we await the various waves of data from the longitudinal study.</p>

How much information will be available publicly? Are there terms of reference and so on? I ask those questions specifically because it is now 2022 and some actions of the Ryan report have still not been implemented. They did not form part of my question but it is important to point out they have not been implemented. I would appreciate if the Minister was in a position to update me on why they have not been implemented and which ones are still to be implemented. There was an implementation body that was very effective. It gave regular updates on the implementation of the Ryan recommendations. As in the case of mental health, having an implementation body in this context is important. I understand it is no longer there but the Minister is getting regular updates on the actions taken. Are those updates public? Can we see on what the Minister is being updated in respect of the work of the Ryan report carried out on the back of the horrific suffering of boys and girls in care?</p>

The next piece of work will be to undertake the research on the group who are ten years out of care. Work will then begin on the longitudinal study and bring together the cohort at which it will be looking. I will ask officials of my Department to provide written detail on the timelines. Obviously, this will be a lengthy piece of work. It will be in progress for at least ten years because that is what a longitudinal study is. I refer to the Growing Up in Ireland study, which provides two or three really valuable pieces of research each year that influence policy decisions and enable my Department to respond.

Within direct provision centres and the national reception centre, 74% of residents have access to independent living facilities.

We have a programme board that brings in expertise from other Departments as well as the private sector. We also have an external advisory committee comprising Dr. Catherine Day, Dr. Lorcan Sirr and Dr. David Donoghue. I will actually be meeting them today after these questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_308"> We have been working closely with a number of other Departments and agencies, in particular the Housing Agency in terms of the provision of new accommodation. Planning is well advanced for the purchasing of properties, developing a system of income support for international protection applicants and integration support. The planning and design of capital projects will commence this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_309">Would I be right in thinking that there has been a rapid increase in the number of people in direct provision and, therefore, the number of people seeking asylum? Will the Minister indicate how many people have been in the system for more than four years? It seems that we are left with a problem that should largely have been resolved by people being processed through the system quickly and definitive decisions being made on their cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_310"> Will the Minister indicate what the alternative model is and how he will get it up and running within two years? From my experience of how slowly matters move, that would be a fair achievement.</p>

            <p eId="para_311">That is a lot to get through in one minute. The Deputy is correct, in that there has been a significant increase in the number of people coming to Ireland seeking international protection, particularly since the October-November period. That increase is reflected in the figures that I set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> I will ask my Department to send the Deputy the specific figure for how many people have been in the system for more than four years. As he knows, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has announced a scheme for regularisation, which is open to people who have been in the international protection process for a number of years. We reckon that approximately 2,800 of them will be able to apply.</p>

            <p eId="para_314">Yes. The Minister's scheme is primarily for people who are undocumented but it has a secondary stream for people who have been in direct provision for a long time. They will be able to apply for regularisation. Obviously, 2,800 is approximately a quarter of 8,500 or thereabouts, but the scheme will address the needs of a significant number of people who, as the Deputy identified, have been in the system for a long time.</p>

            <p eId="para_315">I thank the Minister for that information. There is also a community scheme for refugees whereby communities around the country host refugees. It is a progressive way forward. Has there been much uptake of the scheme by communities? Are many communities coming forward with offers to take refugees? If that could be done, it would not only provide accommodation, but also a loving, open and welcoming community.</p>

            <p eId="para_316">I thank the Deputy for highlighting the importance of the community sponsorship scheme. To clarify, it is available to people who have already been identified as refugees under the Irish refugee protection programme, not people coming in through direct provision. Over the past seven months, the scheme has been particularly important to Ireland's rapid response to the situation in Afghanistan. We have issued 550 visas to people fleeing Afghanistan who were at real risk of losing their lives. Many of them are in emergency reception and orientation centres, EROCs, across the country, but they will then move into the community. Many of them are being supported by community sponsorship groups. Deputies may know of groups that are interested in doing something like this. It is definitely a commitment, but a valuable one in terms of the provision of accommodation and the support from and link with local communities. I have met a number of Afghan refugees who are now integrating into our society and are incredibly grateful for the opportunity they have been given.</p>

            <p eId="para_318">This question relates to domestic violence refuge spaces. How many have been allocated for 2022, what is the cost of each and how much funding has been provided overall? More importantly, how much of the additional €41 million allocation to Tusla will be spent on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, services?</p>

            <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_319">Under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of DSGBV. Tusla is funded from my Department's Vote 40. At the end of 2021, Tusla funded 155 DSGBV-related accommodation units. These consisted of 137 refuge units and 18 safe houses. There were also six other available accommodation units.</p>
            <p eId="para_320"> Tusla has previously advised the Department that the cost of maintaining a single refuge is in the region of €100,000 annually. This estimated annual operating cost is based on a typical all-year round-the-clock refuge with support services and facilities on site. In 2021, Tusla allocated €28 million in core funding for DSGBV services plus €2 million in contingency funding to address Covid challenges. For 2022, I expect Tusla to increase its core funding to €30 million to support DSGBV services. A further €1 million will be allocated to address recommendations arising from Tusla's accommodation review.</p>
            <p eId="para_321"> When I issued my performance statement to Tusla, I outlined the overall parameters of Tusla's financial resources after budget 2022 and my priorities for the coming year. Tusla has prepared its annual business plan for 2022 in accordance with section 46 of the 2013 Act. The plan is undergoing the final edits for publication. It will outline the proposed activities for the year and the proposed allocation of financial resources. I am informed that Tusla is currently finalising service level agreements with operators in the DSGBV sector for the coming year and addressing requests for extra funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> The next step in the provision of DSGBV accommodation will be guided by Tusla's accommodation review. As I outlined in response to a previous question, I expect that to be published by Tusla in the next two weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_325">It is rare that that is said in this House, but it had to be acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> We have had many discussions on DSGBV. In our first days back this term, it dominated debate. There is a cost of €100,000 for one space but there are only 18 safe houses. Even if just from an economic point of view, a safe house is a much better option. There are still counties, including Carlow in my constituency, that do not have refuges. Deputy Tully has mentioned Cavan-Monaghan. Should we be considering a housing model instead? I believe there is such a model in Waterford. It would not be possible everywhere but should we be considering it instead of refuges for people who are coming out of domestic violence?</p>
            <p eId="para_327">Part of the problem in recent years is that there has been a time limit of, say, three months. The refuge has to put that in place because it has to try to manage its service. However, it is very difficult for people and they often end up drifting back into a very negative, violent relationship.</p>

            <p eId="para_328">I fully agree with the Deputy. As she knows, responsibility is moving out of my Department and will be fully a matter for the Minister for Justice in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_329"> With regard to the ongoing focus, we need to increase the number of refuge places. There is no doubt that a refuge is vital in addressing emergency needs when a woman or family is fleeing a life-or-death situation. However, we also need to include in our discussion the concept of safe houses as a medium-term solution for many families, but perhaps not requiring resources to the extent mentioned by the Deputy. The Deputy referred to the cost, which is €100,000 per space. It is a cost we absolutely must pay but, with regard to having a step-down facility to allow families to move back into a slightly more community-based setting, we need to include safe houses in our understanding of the accommodation we need to provide as we continue to address these issues.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Funchion<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_330">I thank the Minister. We do need a wider debate. I am aware that one was had here over recent weeks. I hope that we can continue it and that action will come of it. One of the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly on gender equality was on relationships and sexuality education, the role of consent and gender power dynamics in relationships. We need to have the wider debate in addition to considering the important resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> I want to mention counselling and play therapy. From dealing with Amber Women’s Refuge in Kilkenny, which covers both Carlow and Kilkenny, I am aware that the budget for counselling and play therapy is not absolutely guaranteed. For me, this service is one of the most crucial. One does not just leave a violent situation and get on with life the next day, with everything being fine, because a considerable amount of counselling is required. While I am aware that men suffer from domestic violence, it is mainly women. Children are also affected. The service is invaluable. We need to include it in the wider debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> I welcome the fact that the services are going in under one Department. That is a really good, positive move.</p>

            <p eId="para_333">The additional €2 million, bringing the budget from €28 million to €30 million, will be distributed across the services. That will allow the services to invest in more resources. A lot of flexibility is given to services in determining what they need in their area. I hope that will allow for additional resources for therapies such as play therapy, which I agree are vital. I was in Barnardos in Mulhuddart just before Christmas and noted the great benefits. I spoke to some parents and children who have benefited from the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> It is also important to say that, even though responsibility for accommodation provision will be moving out of my Department, Tusla will still have a child protection role regarding children and families for whom domestic violence has been a key issue. One of the key investments Tusla is making is to put into each of its regions domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, specialists who can deal with those children and families who have had a specific DSGBV experience. The responsibility will remain within Tusla even after the changes we have discussed have taken place. Tusla will continue to have the ability to engage with and support families who have suffered from DSGBV.</p>

            <p eId="para_337">I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> National disability policy transferred to our Department in October 2020 from the Department of Justice and Equality, and this includes co-ordinating two national disability strategies, namely, the national disability inclusion strategy and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities. My Department also acts as the focal point and co-ordination mechanism for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD. In addition, responsibility for related legislation also rests with my Department, and this includes the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts, the Disability Act, the Irish Sign Language Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_339"> Many dedicated disability supports are provided across government — for example, by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Protection — and the funding secured within my Department complements the resources given for disability services across government.</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> Under budget 2022, €1.8 million has been assigned to the disability policy team. This will be used for a broad range of projects to support national disability policy and the programmes and work streams attached to the functions within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_341"> The Deputy may wish to note that responsibility for specialist community-based disability services is due to transfer to my Department from the Department of Health. This is in line with the Taoiseach’s announcement on the formation of the Government. The intention is to have the co-ordination of disability-related issues led by a senior Minister for the first time. Progress is being made in regard to the transfer of community-based disability services. Enabling legislation is due to be published very shortly. The heads were agreed by the Government just before Christmas. It is a complex transfer and it involves very significant amendments to the Health Act 2004 establishing Government arrangements between the HSE and my Department. A budget of more than €2.3 billion will be transferred between Votes while at the same time ensuring no negative impact on current services. Until the enabling legislation is passed in both Houses in early 2022, responsibility for the community-based disability services will remain with the Minister for Health.</p>

            <p eId="para_342">I thank the Minister. He has given a very comprehensive and clear answer to the question. I take it from him that, as of now, the services delivered on the ground are still delivered by the Department of Health but they are to be transferred through the complex legislation, which he said is to be passed early this year. In the real world, allowing for all the delays and the processes in the House, is the Minister talking about implementation by the autumn?</p>
            <p eId="para_343"> Legislation on assisted decision-making has been in gestation for a long time and this has caused much upset. Can the Minister confirm that the legislation will be put through the House expeditiously and that we will be finished once and for all with giving people the right to make their own decisions?</p>

            <p eId="para_344">With the help of Deputy Funchion and her committee, the assisted decision-making legislation is being subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny. I have no doubt that it will be scrutinised swiftly, after which we can bring it through the House. We need it for June of this year. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are committed to that. Working with the committee, we seek to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_345"> I hope the transfer of functions will occur far earlier than I have outlined. As soon as the legislation comes through the House, it can be implemented. The legislation in this regard is not being subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny. This was agreed with the health committee because the legislation is transfer-of-functions legislation. Once it is drafted, it will go straight into the House. That will certainly shorten the timeframe. It concerns a functional change, not a policy change, so I hope we can pass it through the Houses reasonably expeditiously. I hope that by spring, or perhaps early summer, it will be completed and the transfer of functions undertaken.</p>

Can I take it that responsibility for all those with mental and intellectual disabilities and so on will be transferred to the Minister and that acute medicine will remain in the hospitals? Can I take it that services such as those offered by the Brothers of Charity and Ability West will be transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and that such services will be able to benefit from a focus they did not get at times when competing with acute medicine?</p>

            <p eId="para_348"> Responsibility for mental health services will not be transferred.

          <p eId="para_355">Tá costais mhaireachtála agus costais bhia, chíos, chairr, fhuinneamh, theas agus chúram leanaí ag ardú. Tá muintir na tíre seo, gnáth teaghlaigh agus oibrithe, ag streachailt. Níl go leor sa €100 a tugadh do dhaoine le dul in éadan costais leictreachais. Tá an ghéarchéim i bhfad níos leithne ná sin agus caithfidh an Rialtas é sin a thuiscint. Tá moltaí curtha chun tosaigh ag Sinn Féin chun dul i ngleic leis an ngéarchéim seo, na costais a laghdú agus cuidiú le daoine. Tá sé seo ina chúis imní do a lán daoine anois. Caithfidh an Rialtas réitithe réadúla agus uaillmhianacha a chur i gcríoch agus caithfear gnáthdhaoine a chosaint agus cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh, mar atá de cheart acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> The Irish people face a cost-of-living crisis. There is absolutely no doubt about that. In the 12 months to December, inflation reached the highest levels in 20 years. Rents are spiralling out of control as a result of the Government's housing plan. Childcare costs amount to a second mortgage for many families. Putting food on the table and running a car has never been more expensive. Energy prices rose by 27% and the cost of home-heating oil has soared by 53%. Prices will continue to rise, with workers and families under pressure like never before.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The Government has had months to deal with the cost-of-living crisis but it failed to come up with a comprehensive plan to support these households. Instead the Government is trading sound bites with leaks from parliamentary party meetings rather than real and immediate action. The Irish people deserve a Government that understands the difficulties that they are facing, not a Government that ignores, delays or, indeed, even makes things worse in some cases. The time to act is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Not all households will feel the cost-of-living crisis equally. We know from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that the poorest households spend three times more of their income on heating and lighting their homes than the richest households, and that those in the middle spend twice as much as those at the higher end.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> For months, Sinn Féin has been raising the issues of the cost of living with the Tánaiste, with the Government and with the Taoiseach, and we have been bringing forward proposals that the Government has rejected over and over again. Since September, before the budget, we told the Government that what was needed was a €10 increase in core social welfare rates to protect those most in need of support. What the Government provided did not even keep up with price increases and, therefore, it is a de facto cut. These families will be poorer this year than they were last year. We must see an additional €5 increase in these core rates to prevent families and children from being worse off this year than they were last year. We in Sinn Féin have called for an extension of the fuel allowance season by two weeks and for the eligibility criteria to be expanded so that more people can avail of the fuel allowance. The Government has also refused to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The Government needs to halt its plans. It is just crazy that, within three months, the Government plans to increase the cost of home-heating oil and gas by heaping on another carbon tax on those commodities despite the fact that home-heating oil has increased by 53% in the past year and energy prices are up by 27%. The Government needs to stop that increase that is about to take effect on 1 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> We have called for a refundable tax credit equivalent to one month's rent putting up to €1,500 back in renters' pockets to deal with the fact that rents are out of control - rising by over 8% - and we need to ban rent increases for the next three years. That is some of the action that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> These are some of the measures that the Tánaiste and the Government could take to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Far from trading soundbites at the Tánaiste's parliamentary party meetings and selective leaks, let us deal and get on with the job that Deputy Varadkar was elected to do. Let us govern. Let us make sure that people are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Does the Tánaiste plan to take any meaningful action in relation to this situation rather than issue soundbites? It is time for Government to do its job to protect workers and families from being fleeced.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_182">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue again today in the House. The Government acknowledges that the cost of living is rising. It is rising very fast at present, faster than it has in 20 or 30 years, and people are feeling the squeeze. Whether it is the shock of looking at a gas bill, whether it is the electricity bill or whether it is the rising cost of filling a tank of diesel or petrol, everyone is feeling it in their pocket and, of course, those on lowest incomes are feeling it more so than those who are not. The Government gets that. We have already taken action, much of which was opposed by Deputy Doherty's party, and some of which was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> We acknowledge, though, that the action that we have taken to help families with the cost of living is not enough and for that reason, the three party leaders, when we met on Monday night, commissioned line Ministers to develop proposals for a package of measures that will allow us to help families with the cost of living. That is being worked on at present, with further discussions on it today. I am meeting with the unions and employers this afternoon and there will be a chance to discuss it then. There will be a committee meeting of the economic Cabinet committee which I chair next week which will provide another chance to discuss it as well. We will make a decision on it soon, certainly in the next couple of weeks, because we acknowledge that the cost of living is rising, that it is causing a huge squeeze for many families and that as a Government we have to do something about it. We are aware that other governments in other parts of the world have taken action too and we believe we must do so as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> In terms of the context, it is important to bear in mind that when the budget was prepared in September and October last, the estimates for inflation were somewhere between 2% and 3% and we built the budget on that basis. However, that has not been the case. It turns out that inflation has been much higher. It is in and around 5%, and rather than being a temporary phenomenon, while it might moderate, it looks like we may be stuck with high inflation for a longer period than we would have anticipated. When the facts change you need to adjust your policies and that is what we intend to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Back as far as last March, I was talking about the possibility of inflation. As far back as last June, I was strongly advocating for a personal tax package, welfare increases and pension increases in the budget, and we achieved that. That was done. Perhaps it was not adequate but it was done. Let us not forget that Deputy Doherty's party opposed the reductions in personal taxation. I advocated reductions in personal taxation to make sure that people getting a pay increase got to keep it because people earning over €38,000 who get a pay increase lose half of it in income tax. I wanted to make sure that people getting a pay increase - thankfully, most people will get a pay increase this year - got to hold onto it. The Deputy did not want that. I also wanted to make sure that those workers who do not get a pay increase - Deputy Doherty might not realise this but there some workers who will not get a pay increase this year because their employer will not or cannot provide it - would get something and the Deputy opposed that too.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Sinn Féin needs to be honest about its positions as a party. It might be the case that the Deputy objects to increases in carbon tax because of climate scepticism etc. but he also objects to reductions in personal taxation. The truth is, when it comes to after-tax income, significant numbers of middle-income people in the State would be worse off if Sinn Féin's budget had been introduced rather than ours. That is a fact. We acknowledge that things have changed since then, the cost of living has increased by more than anticipated and we need to act on that. We are working on those proposals now.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">The cost-of-living crisis did not just fall from the sky overnight. It has been here with us for many months. We have been raising that with the Government. Indeed, we raised that with the Government before the budget. The Government failed to protect adequately those social welfare recipients who pay three times more on energy costs than the wealthiest in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">As a result, under the package for which the budget has been approved, they are going to be poorer by hundreds of euro this year than they were last year. We have a proposal on the way to do this, which is to insulate them from the cost-of-living crisis by increasing core social welfare payments by 5%. The Government plans to increase the cost of oil and gas for households on 1 May, less than three months from now. The price of gas will increase by €17 and by €19 for every fill of home heating oil. The cost of the latter has already increased by 53%. Can the Tánaiste state that he will stop that increase taking place at a time when people are seriously struggling?</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Rent also has a serious impact in the context of inflation. Rent is increasing by 8%. We need to ban rent increases. We have put those proposals before the Government not weeks or months but years ago. We must put back into people's pockets a refundable tax credit of up to €1,500. Cutting the cost of childcare is another way to reduce the cost of living on these families. It should be reduced by a third and the proper investment should be made.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_376">The Government acknowledges that inflation, in particular the type of inflation that we have at the moment, which is very much driven by higher energy prices, is impacting on those with lower incomes more so than those with higher incomes. That is clear. People on lower incomes spend more on energy and fuel, or a higher percentage of their income on energy, fuel and groceries than those on higher incomes. As a consequence of that - the Deputy is right about this - inflation impacts on different households in different ways. At the moment, inflation is impacting more seriously on lower income households than higher income households. In recognition of that, in the budget we did increase core social welfare rates. We also increased the fuel allowance, the living-alone allowance and the child dependant allowance. We did those things precisely because it was the lowest incomes that were impacted most. As I said earlier, we acknowledge that more needs to be done. We are working on those proposals now. I hear the Deputy’s proposal for an increase in core social welfare rates. The difficulty with that is that a lot of working people are not on social welfare. Deputy Doherty might not appreciate this, but people who are working hard, who earn middle incomes or who might look like they have good incomes on paper, also have to deal with the high cost of living and his proposal would exclude them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_380">In 2018 the Tánaiste told the European Parliament that Ireland was a climate laggard and promised to do much more to protect the environment. Four years later, the European Commission is not very impressed with the Government's progress. A director in the European Commission's Directorate-General for Environment, Aurel Ciobanu-Dordea, recently gave a speech in which he did not just give the Government both barrels, he actually rolled up in a tank and launched a volley of heavy fire in its direction. I do not have time to list all the egregious breaches of environmental laws and standards that he cited among his laundry list of complaints, but I will just give a flavour. He noted that 50% of Ireland's urban wastewater is still not treated in compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive. In case there is any doubt about how shameful this is, it should be noted that said directive dates from 1991. Leakage rates are one of the highest in Europe, currently at an enormous 40%. The water framework directive has still not been fully implemented. The deadline for that was 2003. Meanwhile, almost half of Ireland's rivers have unsatisfactory water quality due to high nitrate levels, which have increased by 26% since 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> On our biodiversity crisis, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea highlighted that many of our bird species are in serious decline, with 54 now on a red list and facing extinction. Further, just 2.5% of our marine waters are designated marine protected areas. The EU target to which we have agreed in this regard is 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> On failures of governance, Mr. Ciobanu-Dordea said he was particularly concerned with the punitive cost to the public of access to justice, with anyone wishing to take an environmental case forced into the most expensive legal arena in Europe, which is the Irish High Court. Also of deep concern to the Commission is the recent trend among developers to issue strategic lawsuit against public participation, SLAPP, suits. These are being launched against environmental campaigners. This manifests as wealthy developers threatening individual members of community groups with financial ruin by suing them in the High Court for defamation if they dare to challenge planning decisions. The Government's answer to that charge, if the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is to be believed, is to make it even harder and more expensive for campaigners to take these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> How are we expected to take the Tánaiste's commitments on the environment seriously given this shameful record? Could he confirm his intention to further butcher our planning laws and make it even harder and more expensive to take cases to protect the environment? When will the Government publish the review of our defamation law, which for months has been sitting on the desk of the Minister for Justice?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_193">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_384">I saw some media reports on the report in question. I have not had a chance to read it, and it would not be fair to comment on it until I have had a chance to do so. When I said in 2018 that Ireland was a climate laggard and our ambition was to be a climate leader, I meant that. At the time, an NGO that scores countries on where they stand in terms of climate action and environmental commitment placed us in the lowest tier of countries. We have now moved up slightly. We are in the second-lowest tier. We are certainly not a leader, but we are not in the laggard group either anymore, and that is because of the work that has been done since 2019, ably led by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in this coalition. We have a long way to go, whether it is in terms of climate action, water quality or biodiversity. We understand that as a Government and we are working very hard on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> On planning, what the Government intends to do is what is set out in the programme for Government, which was supported by all three parties in government and signed up to not just by Deputies but also by ordinary members of all three parties. That is to make sure that we have a planning process that makes decisions quickly, appropriately, and fairly. We have a system in Ireland where, generally speaking, the planning application goes through a council, a decision is then made and people have the right of appeal and they can appeal to An Bord Pleanála. That is the process. It is not expensive for people to make an objection to the council or make an observation to An Bord Pleanála. Judicial reviews are only supposed to happen on a point of law. That is the whole point of a judicial review. It is not supposed to assess whether it is right or wrong to grant planning permission. That is for An Bord Pleanála to decide. Its planners are the experts. The point of a judicial review is not to rehearse the planning arguments or the rights or wrongs of a particular development, it is to double check that An Bord Pleanála or the council followed the correct procedures. That is what a judicial review is supposed to be about. Some people are trying to turn judicial reviews into something else. That is manifestly wrong in my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> If we look at the number of planning cases that go to judicial review in Ireland compared with other countries, we can see that there is a higher percentage here. It is easier to get something judicially reviewed in Ireland than in other countries. That is a problem. There may be different reasons for that. It may be due to deficiencies in our planning laws. If that is the case, we need to change them. It may be because of mistakes being made by councils and An Bord Pleanála, in which case we need to make sure they make fewer mistakes. It may be the case that they do not have enough resources or expertise. We may need to help them with that as well, but we also need to bear in mind that under our process, when a judicial review happens, a judge does not necessarily have to hear both sides of the argument before allowing a judicial review to take place. Sometimes a judge can allow a judicial review without actually hearing what the consequences could be, and there can be consequences.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">Big investments on which I have worked very hard were nearly lost to Ireland because of the delays caused by judicial reviews. Some were lost.

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_389">The increase in the number of judicial reviews in this country coincides completely with the introduction of the strategic housing development, SHD, planning process. That is because SHDs bypass local democracy, so there was not an opportunity for people to put in planning objections to local councils. They only had the opportunity to raise objections with An Bord Pleanála. If that failed, the only course open to them was judicial review. The fact is that more than 90% of the judicial reviews relating to SHDs were successful. This indicates that those people were 100% correct in bringing those reviews and that the fault is not with them for bringing the reviews or for clogging up the judicial system, it is with bad planning and bad planning laws and comes down to an inability on the part of people to engage with democracy and planning decisions at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I note the Government has decided to do away with the strategic housing developments, SHDs, but it gave so much time and opportunity to developers to launch hundreds of them in local communities. We are dealing with these. I deal with them in north Wicklow and every few weeks there is another application which people want to object to. Can the Tánaiste respond to those issues please?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_197">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">I thank the Deputy. The thinking behind the SHDs was to speed up planning and to get planning permissions through more quickly for housing and apartments. It did not work which is why we had to change our policy on strategic housing developments by going back to something similar to an older system where the application is made to the council first and then there is a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> From the Deputy’s contribution it sounds to me that she thinks judicial reviews are all about housing. They are not. A major expansion of Intel in north Kildare was threatened by judicial review. It was a hugely important project for this country in terms of our industrial development and the tax revenues we receive to help pay for healthcare, childcare and housing and in providing jobs for people, not just in Kildare but in the Deputy’s constituency, Wicklow, and in my constituency, Dublin West. Really important road projects are threatened by judicial reviews. In time, I am absolutely sure that we will see the same happen with the metro and other important public infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> It is a problem that the building of important public infrastructure, such as roads, railways and windfarms to help deal with climate action, cost more and take longer in Ireland, in part because of judicial reviews. We need to deal with that.</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_394">I want to raise a very difficult issue with the Tánaiste this morning which relates to the overuse of and in some cases addiction to over-the-counter medication, in particular, those medications which contain codeine. The context in which I am raising this is the death of a young 39-year-old woman at Sligo University Hospital just over two weeks ago. That happened because of her addiction to over-the-counter opioid-containing medication. Her name was Laura Newell and her sad and untimely death has been reported in many newspapers. The reason I am raising this with the Tánaiste is that her sister, whom I know, wrote to me and, indeed, to all of the public representatives in the Sligo-Leitrim Constituency, and asked us to raise the issue of dependence on and addiction to over-the-counter painkillers in Ireland. She specifically stated, “I await your response in the hope that my family can rely on you to raise these concerns at the highest level.” She went on to state, “My hope would be that legislation could be put in place that will remove the medicine from behind the counter and be available ... only through consultation with the GP.”</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> It is a long email and it is heart-breaking because it tells how the 39-year-old woman died painfully from addiction. Her sister names the over-the-counter medication. I will not do so here, but it is a household name. There is nothing extraordinary about Laura Newell’s sad story but her addiction started as a response to the need for pain medication due to undiagnosed endometriosis. In order to try to deal with her pain, she started taking over-the-counter opioid medication. As her sister said, the drugs she was addicted to are legal and easy to obtain. She said that she was buying them from chemists throughout the county and further afield. Recently, she started accessing them online from pharmacies across Ireland. She said that these purchases are unregulated and make it easy for addicts to access opioid medicines. There is much more in it and it is a sad email but the core of this is that her family have decided to be quite candid about her death. As her sister said, if there is to be any sense out of her loss, it would be the prevention of any other family going through this experience. </p>
          <p eId="para_396"> In that context I am asking the Tánaiste if his Government will consider two things - to review the legislation and regulation around the sale of over-the-counter painkillers containing codeine and to look at the whole issue of pain management. It is not just enough to put regulation in place. We must also help people to deal with the issue of pain and chronic pain, which is a very significant concern for people all over the country. I can guarantee the Tánaiste that there are people sitting here in this Chamber today who know what that is. This is a big issue and I would like to hear a considered response from the Tánaiste.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I thank the Deputy. I will discuss this with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and will provide the Deputy with a more considered response a little bit later on. I had a chance to read the article about Laura Newell and her family in <i>The Sligo Champion</i>. I express my condolences to the family on Laura’s loss and to her two daughters aged 18 and 15 who have been left behind. I want also to express my thanks to the Newell family for being willing to talk about this issue as we do not talk enough about the issue of prescription drug addiction in Ireland. It is a very real problem. It is very sad to see that she started taking painkillers because her endometriosis had not been diagnosed. Endometriosis is frequently not diagnosed, which is a real shame, because once diagnosed, it can be treated very successfully. Unfortunately, that did not happen in her case.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Her story tells us something that all of us know which is that addiction can happen to anyone from any background or walk of life. It is very important that we recognise that the people who suffer from addiction need help. They should not be stigmatised or criminalised and they also need to be reassured that if they seek help, their medication will not be taken away from them, or that they will at least be given an alternative, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Prescription drugs are a hidden addiction much of the time in Ireland. Sometimes it is codeine, other times it is benzos and other drugs. I had an opportunity over the past number of weeks to watch “Dopesick”. I am not sure if Members have seen that programme but it is about the OxyContin prescription drug dose epidemic in America. It is a different jurisdiction, a different drug and a different system but it gives a real insight into the problems that any country can have with prescription drugs where they are not properly regulated and are easily abused. It is based on a book called <i>Empire of Pain</i> which I have not as yet read but it is on my reading list. </p>
          <p eId="para_400"> On codeine, specifically, because of its potential for misuse, it is a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 1984. Some low-dose preparations are currently available without prescription and are most commonly used in combination with other analgesics like paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief. Less frequently, it is used as a single ingredient cough suppressant. Low-dose preparations such as these are regulated as Schedule 5 controlled drugs. At the moment these drugs can all be sold in pharmacies under the personal supervision of a pharmacist and are not available for self-selection. The maximum dose of codeine in a non-prescription product is limited per the medical products regulations with the maximum daily dose authorised duration of no longer than three days. Pack sizes are limited as well. Codeine was a medicine that was very easily available over-the-counter in the past and it is more tightly regulated now. Somebody going into a pharmacy looking for codeine, Solpadeine or Nurofen Plus cannot just buy it and will be asked questions by the pharmacist but, perhaps, that is not enough. It is something that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, will want to give further examination to.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I thank the Tánaiste. We all deeply sympathise with the family of Laura Newell. The purpose of this discussion is to ask what can be done about it and how can we prevent it happening again. Her sister talked to me about what happened in Australia. That country banned over-the-counter painkiller medication in 2018 and it has worked for that country. It has not caused many of the problems that the people there thought it might cause. I would like to hear, if not today but certainly very soon, that this Government will examine this issue and look at the possibility of doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> When I was a Member of the European Parliament, I chaired the pain group and we were involved with the WHO in ensuring that for the first time two years ago pain was seen as a disease in its own right as distinct from a symptom of another disease. One of the issues we face is that pain management is woefully under-resourced in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">A two-pronged approach is needed. I hope the Tánaiste can give me some positive indication that he will consider that.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">I will have to double-check with the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, as to exactly what the legal position is on this matter. There are two regulators in this area, as the Deputy knows. The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland regulates pharmacists and is responsible for making sure that pharmacists do not hand out these medicines too easily, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority is responsible for the regulation of medicines, including controlled drugs such as these. I am not sure if it is a ministerial or Government decision or a regulatory one but I will look into it and come back to the Deputy in a few weeks with something a bit more solid.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">Many farmers in this country are facing a wipeout this year due to the astronomical increases in fertiliser costs. A farmer who paid €300 last year for a tonne, or 20 bags, of the most popular type of fertiliser will pay €900 this year. This is an astonishing increase that will leave many farmers with a nightmare decision as to how they will pay for fertiliser this year. Experts estimate that a farmer with 100 ha will end up paying €40,000 more for fertiliser this year. In fairness, most farmers I know would not own 100 ha but most would own 50 ha so their fertiliser costs will increase by €20,000. A typical mid-sized farmer feeding 120 tonnes of rations and using 30 tonnes of fertiliser per year will see his or her fertiliser bill rising by €23,400 a year. No farmer can take this hit. They will simply go out of business, owing co-ops throughout the country tens of thousands of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> The Government is well aware of this crisis. In October, the Taoiseach was told on the floor of the Dáil by the Rural Independent Group that this fertiliser crisis was imminent and that the Government needed to do something about it immediately. In November, another member of our group told the Taoiseach to take action immediately. In the past couple of weeks, we have been pleading with the Government to take action but we have heard nothing to date about what the Government has done. The week before last at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I challenged Mr. Fabien Santini of the EU agriculture committee on solutions to this crisis. He said that the rising price of gas was mainly to blame, as well as the fact that import levies are adding to the crisis. However, he also stated that the government of each member state has been given latitude to provide unique farmer support through the relaxation of the state aid framework. He further stated that this will only be available until June 2022 and would allow for financial aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> Shamefully, at that same meeting, the Green Party member of the committee emphatically expressed that he wanted to broaden the issue to ask why we are so dependent on fertiliser. He said, "The reality is that these artificial fertilisers are having a devastating effect locally". He further stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_408">In addition, using these inputs allows us to grow more grass and have higher stocking rates in our farms. That has a knock-on increase on the methane that we produce. All in all, it seems to make sense to drive the organic angle ...</p>
          <p eId="para_409">My worry is that such deranged thinking is feeding into the mindset of the Government and is detrimental to the food chain in this country. It is astonishing that our Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael-Green Party Government has so far failed to use the tools referred to by Mr. Santini to assist our crisis-struck farmers. It is shameful that our Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completely failed to take action despite the crisis we are in. Irish farming families need a strong Government at this time and a subsidy is immediately needed for farmers who purchase fertilisers, perhaps one similar to the subsidy given to farmers during the fodder crisis some years back. Maybe I am wrong and maybe the Greens are not wagging the tail of this Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Government. If not, what has the Government discussed at Cabinet since the Taoiseach was told of this fertiliser cost crisis, which affects tens of thousands of farmers, in October and November? What solutions has the Government put in place to save many farmers from wipe-out this year?</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_203">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_410">I am not at liberty to tell the Deputy what was and was not discussed at Cabinet, but I can tell him that the Government is seized of this issue. I had an opportunity to meet with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA yesterday, alongside the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon. It raised a lot of issues, including climate action, the Common Agricultural Policy, its concerns around the dairy forum, which I share, and the problems the pig industry is facing. One of the matters raised was the very high price and cost of fertilisers, which in some cases have even trebled in cost. That is an extraordinary increase for any input and it will, in turn, increase costs for farmers. The latter can then drive up food prices, which impacts negatively on consumers. The levels of dry farming could potentially come down as well, which we do not want to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> While there are a number of factors at play in the market, there is unfortunately no sign of fertiliser prices easing in the short to medium term. Energy prices will remain well above January 2021 levels and increased global demand continues, particularly from the big grain-producing countries. Increased transport costs and EU-imposed tariffs on duties on certain third country imports are also adding to prices. The information we have from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine indicates that fertiliser supplies are likely to remain tight but usage is expected to be lower over the next few months in response to higher prices. From 2 February, Russia imposed a ban on ammonium nitrate exports for two months until 2 April. This will place added pressure on the availability of fertiliser, particularly calcium ammonium nitrate. The Department is continuing to monitor the situation very closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, launched the 2022 soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign on 26 January in response to the unprecedented rise in fertiliser prices. As part of this campaign Teagasc has put together a comprehensive information pack for farmers and their advisers with a compendium of 20 fact sheets designed to optimise the use of plant nutrients to help farmers address the challenge of maintaining their farm outputs in the face of rising fertiliser costs and reduced availability. These fact sheets cover soil testing, lime application, nitrogen use, organic manures, fertiliser spreading and many other topics that will be incredibly useful for farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The European Commission is currently examining the effect on the European market of removing anti-dumping measures. A decision on this is expected shortly. If that decision is favourable, it may allow us to do something more to help.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply, but it was muddled to say the least. The most he said is that farmers will get an information pack. Farmers do not want an information pack; they want some of the relief of the sort that Mr. Santini of the EU agricultural committee told us two weeks ago can be given by the Government. We know of farmers who could not get credit and who had to pay upfront for fertiliser in November and December. They are not able to sustain this astronomical increase in the cost of fertiliser. The Tánaiste says the Russians are the problem. We saw what happened last week with the Russians and the fishermen. We will have to send out a couple of farmers to resolve this issue, seeing as the fishermen were the only ones who could resolve the issue last week. The resolution to this problem lies with the Government. It can intervene and is failing to do so. Please tell me the Government is going to intervene. What interventions is it going to make in order to assist farmers? They do not need an information package. They are not stupid. They are well aware of what is going on. Their pockets are being dented hot and heavy and the Government is not doing anything about it even though it can. I am pleading with the Tánaiste to stand by the farmers of this country immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">We would all agree that reduced use of fertiliser would be beneficial. It would be beneficial environmentally and would also help reduce costs for farmers. I do not think we should dismiss Teagasc in trying to give advice to farmers on how they can do that. I am sure the vast majority know all of this already but there may be people who benefit from that additional advice and I do not think it should be dismissed in that way. I acknowledge that reducing fertiliser use is not going to solve this problem. We need to reduce the price as well. We are, in comparison with other EU countries, a very small market when it comes to fertiliser sales. No fertilisers are manufactured in Ireland and this results in indigenous fertiliser companies being price-takers, dependent on global supply and demand and subject to exchange rates. The Minister is working with the European Commission on this, particularly in relation to trade defence instruments such as the imposition of duties and tariffs, which are done on a European level. If we could get some change on that it would help bring down prices. We are working on that at the moment.</p>

Yet, yesterday evening we witnessed a reckless stunt on the part of the DUP. A Minister who is no stranger to political chaos stated that he had instructed his Department to stop all checks on goods at ports. This is a cynical attempt by Edwin Poots to shore up his own political position and that of his party as we face into an assembly election in a number of weeks.

          <p eId="para_418">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As I said in the Seanad last night, the Irish Government's position on this is very clear. The British Government has signed an international agreement, which includes the protocol on Northern Ireland, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. That is now international law and the British Government has an obligation to act in a way that is consistent with international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Last night, the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Mr. Edwin Poots, said he would instruct his officials to stop sanitary and phytosanitary checks in ports in Northern Ireland on goods coming across the Irish Sea. We do not regard that as consistent with the obligations the United Kingdom has under the protocol. My understanding is checks are continuing today while senior officials are trying to get legal clarity on the matter. I was in contact with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland last night and I have been in contact, at length, with the Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Maroš Šefčovič, on the matter this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">Yesterday, I wrote to the Minister for Education about the leaving certificate, asking her to clarify two matters. The first was what would happen if a student contracted Covid-19 during exam time and what contingencies are in place for that. I also asked her to waive the exam fee, which is €116 for the leaving certificate and €109 for the junior certificate, and I understand there may be some good news in that regard for the thousands of families expected to pay it. Will the Tánaiste confirm it is the intention of the Government to waive the fee for junior and leaving certificate examination students this year?</p>

I spoke with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, this morning, and she confirms that fees for both the leaving and junior certificate exams are being waived for this year. As the Deputy knows, some families are exempt from payment, but for those which are not exempt, this will be a saving of €116 in the case of the leaving certificate and €109 for the junior cycle exams. It is a small act but perhaps it will help some families with the high cost of living. It is some recognition of the fact that children and families are being put under so much pressure as a result of the pandemic. That was confirmed by the Minister, Deputy Foley, this morning. Those logging on to the State Examinations Commission website today will see the information is already there.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">I ask the Tánaiste about the increase in house prices and collapse in homeownership levels. House prices have increased by 14% in the past year and homeownership levels have collapsed among people of prime working age. In the early 1990s, two thirds of people were homeowners by the age of 28. Now at that age, people are lucky to have managed to move from their parents' homes. Homeownership levels have collapsed since Fine Gael took office more than a decade ago and although the rate of house building is increasing, there are not more homes available for first-time buyers because new homes are going to investment funds and institutions that charge unaffordable rents. Does the Tánaiste agree the time for the favourable tax treatment of investment funds should be ended to give people who want to buy their own home a fair chance?</p>

          <p eId="para_423">I thank the Deputy. We all know what happened here when we had a banking and financial crisis ten or 11 years ago. The banks, the construction industry and housing supply collapsed, and as a consequence of inadequate supply, houses prices started rising again and are now very high and out of reach for many people. It is a social disaster, quite frankly, that people in their 20s and 30s who would have been able to own a home 20, 30 or 40 years ago simply cannot now. One of the biggest challenges facing the Government is turning that around, increasing supply and putting in place schemes to enable people in their late 20s and 30s to be able to buy a home, just as they used to be able to do not that long ago. That is something we are working on very closely. Anything involving tax treatment is a budgetary matter and would be considered by the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">Two weeks ago, the Government announced a €1,000 payment as recognition for the work done during the pandemic by care workers in hospital settings, and that must be welcomed. Last week, we saw added to the people who will receive the payment the home help staff who continue to do Trojan work in their communities. One sector has been overlooked, and those are the carers working in section 39 organisations. They have provided extraordinary levels of care to loved ones during the pandemic and played a significant role in supporting our healthcare system by taking care of vulnerable people during the pandemic. I plead with the Tánaiste to recognise their efforts and also those of home carers. They should be given the respect they deserve with this €1,000 recognition payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">On 13 February it will be 41 years since the terrible Stardust fire in Artane in Dublin, in which 48 young people died and 240 young people were injured. In September 2019, the Attorney General announced that an inquest must go ahead as this was in the public interest. The Department of Justice leased the RDS in Ballsbridge for one year for the Stardust inquest, and spent nearly €2 million, out of an €8 million fund on renting it and fitting it out. In October of last year the families of the victims, and their legal team, were advised by the coroner that after February the lease expires. The families are very upset that no venue has been tied down to continue the Stardust inquest at the end of this month, and that no arrangements are in place to ensure there will be a jury for it. Will the Tánaiste intervene in this? Will he and the Minister for Justice meet with the families on this?</p>

          <p eId="para_467">The coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane, is independent in her functions. There are very strict rules around the extent to which a politician can intervene with the coronial process. As the Deputy is aware, a bespoke courtroom was built in the RDS to facilitate the inquests. The contract for this special courtroom is due to expire at the end of this month. The Government recognises that this is a sensitive situation and wants to assure the families that it is committed to ensuring that a new venue is in place to permit the inquest to be continued by the Dublin District Coroner. I want to assure the families that the matter is being actively worked on. The Office of Public Works, on behalf of the Government, is securing alternative premises and we intend that this situation will be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">I recently had the pleasure of visiting Dunsink Observatory in my constituency. It is an historic and environmental gem. Unfortunately, I could only access it by travelling through the Tánaiste's constituency. This is due to a chronic problem of illegal dumping. The Fianna Fáil Senators, including Senator Malcolm Byrne, have brought forward the Local Government (Surveillance Powers in Relation to Certain Offences) Bill 2022 to try to put on a legislative basis the use of such technology as drone footage and number plate recognition in this regard. I ask that the Government would take this on board. Illegal dumping is a chronic problem across all of Dublin North-West and in many other Dublin communities.</p>

We should make better use of it and I hope people will have the chance to visit if they have not already done so. It is in one of those interface areas that crosses sometimes into my constituency and sometimes into the Deputy's. It is currently in Deputy McAuliffe's constituency, and it might be in mine yet again. It is high time that Dunsink Lane was reopened so that people can access it from both Finglas and Castleknock. That road was closed for particular reasons a long time ago, but those reasons have now passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">In May 2019 the people of Limerick voted on the issue of a directly elected mayor. To date, despite efforts by me and others to find out a timeline for when we would see the legislation and, crucially, when the election will take place, we have no update on that. I raised this issue in November with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and he said he would come back to be, which he did not unfortunately. I was also concerned when I heard a response by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to a question in the Dáil last week. The Minister of State said there is a big challenge in getting powers from Dublin devolved to Limerick. We can see the benefits that a directly elected mayor would bring into other jurisdictions, and I would appreciate any help colleagues can give me in this regard. I hope the Tánaiste will provide some clarity on this remark, as it suggests to me that there may be an effort by some Ministers and their Departments to limit the proposed powers of a future democratically elected mayor in Limerick. This would be an utter betrayal of what people voted for in 2019. The people expect the mayor to be more than a ribbon cutter, and any chance to dilute or withhold powers would be a significant problem for us. When we will see the legislation, and when can people vote for the elected mayor?</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I met with the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, last night and at my request this was one of the issues on the agenda. I am very committed to the project of directly elected mayors. It was always the intention that the mayor would not just take on most of the functions of the chief executive of the local authority but would also have additional functions that would be devolved from central government. The legislation is progressing well, and it is intended that it would be in the House well before the summer, and hopefully enacted well before the summer. There is no date for the mayoral election yet because obviously the legislation must be enacted first. The intention is to have that legislation done before the summer recess. There is, quite frankly, some bureaucratic resistance from certain Departments - not mine - when it comes to the delegation and devolution of functions. It never goes as far as some people would want it to, but it should go far. In my view, this is the prototype for what could be done in Cork, Galway and Dublin. I really want it to work in Limerick, and we are determined that it should.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">The programme for Government contains a very significant commitment to job creation, in particular outside our capital city. Thankfully, due to the good work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Irish job creators that is now beginning to bear fruit. Alongside that, unfortunately, it provides a challenge for us with an emerging skills shortage. From talking to a number of companies in Galway I am aware that they are in very serious danger of losing market share and being unable to gain new market share because of delays in processing work permits. I understand this is now taking four to five months. Are there any additional resources or procedural changes we can apply to expedite the process for these companies who urgently need to be able to access work permits in a timely manner?</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I thank Deputy Cannon raising this issue. It is a big item on my plate at the moment and that of the Minister of State, Deputy English. There has been a 50% increase in work permit applications this year compared with before the pandemic in 2019. This is driven by a labour shortage for employers who cannot get staff. It is not just in Ireland; it is also in the European Union and in the European Economic Area. We have an action plan to reduce the delays. Currently, it is 19 weeks, which is totally unacceptable. We do not accept that, and we have an action plan. It will involve some system changes. There is a change around the way doctors' work permits are reviewed so they do not have to be done so frequently. We have also beefed up staff numbers. We have gone from 15 or 16 staff up to 50 staff in that section over time and have transferred from other areas. A lot of the new staff are doing work permits for the first time and learning how to do the job. I am assured that we will start to see those wait times coming down over the next couple of weeks.</p>

Will the Tánaiste indicate the Government's plans for the State to take a number of desks in those digital hubs? It would make it more viable for the communities to have digital hubs and would also give people who are working for the public sector an opportunity to work in their own communities. Has the Tánaiste looked at the issues? What are the Government's plans to take desks in these digital hubs in rural communities?</p>

          <p eId="para_477">I know the Deputy has a real interest in this matter. We spoke on the phone about this not too long ago. At the moment, through my Department and through the Department of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, we have helped to fund remote hubs and community hubs. To the best of my knowledge, however, currently no Department or Government agency rents desks. I may be wrong about that, but it is something that we need to give consideration to. We want to see more people working remotely in rural towns and villages, in particular, and it might make sense for the public service to come together and option some desks in a few different places, to make those hubs viable and to give people that option.</p>

Can the Tánaiste accept that the unnecessary delays and the obstacles being put in the way of homeowners who have paid almost €7,000 to certified engineers who established that the houses are impacted by pyrite and mica are wholly unacceptable.

          <p eId="para_479"> With regard to the houses impacted by pyrite that were sold by Mayo County Council, will the Tánaiste ask that local authorities take full responsibility for those houses? The council engineers signed off on them and sold them to innocent homeowners.</p>

There is a vast opportunity to create tens of thousands of jobs in this country. We have a good plan in place, but politics, economics and technology move quickly. We should seek to accelerate and expedite the existing plan. The programme for Government says where we will go, but we need to look at it again and state that we have to go there faster.

If the current energy price hikes and the current instability in Russia and Ukraine tell us anything, it is that the sooner we move away from fossil fuels towards greater use of renewable electricity and new fuels such as green hydrogen, the better in terms of energy security and price stability. We should accelerate our plans and ambitions in that regard. How we do that is a matter for discussion. I am not sure how we will do it. I am frustrated by the slow rate of progress. I think everyone interested in this area is. By the way, one issue is the judicial reviews.

          <p eId="para_485">I do not have an update on that report, but I will tell the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that the Deputy raised it and ask him to revert to the Deputy directly. We should acknowledge, however, that both the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade provide a very good service. It is a service that has improved in the last couple of years. Sometimes when management and administration staff are hired, it is precisely so paramedics are freed up from administrative work.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">I will return to the issue of the €1,000 bonus. Obviously, it will require legislative change to ensure it is tax free and that a chunk of it is not taken out from either the employer's or the employee's contribution. Will that legislative change include organisations that wish to pay it, where they deem that their employees or even their volunteers put themselves at huge risk at the time? I am not asking if the State will pay this money but whether organisations that determine their employees come within this description will be able to pay that money without them or their employees having to give a large chunk of it to the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I have asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to examine that as part of the legislation. Employers have approached me, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and have told me that they want to pay their staff a pandemic bonus from their own resources, but that if they do so their staff could lose perhaps half of it in tax. I have asked the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to examine that as an option. It is already possible for employers to pay up to €500 per year in the form of a bonus that is tax free, but it has to be done in a particular way and it cannot go above €500. Perhaps, as a one-off measure, we might allow that to go to €1,000. I have asked the Minister to look at that in the context of that law.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">Over the last six years, the people of this island, particularly those in Northern Ireland, have been used as a political plaything by the forces that have driven Brexit. With the announcement last night of the suspension of checks and the rumours that the First Minister is due to resign, once again the people of Northern Ireland are being put at risk. A collapse of Stormont will see no budget being passed by the assembly and no apologies given for institutional abuse. We will again see the people of Northern Ireland, the majority of whom did not vote for Brexit, utterly let down by a small minority on this island and a worrying minority on another island. How is the Government going to stand up for the people of Northern Ireland and ensure that the programme for Government commitment to protecting the gains of the peace process, the Good Friday Agreement and the all-island economy will be maintained?</p>

          <p eId="para_491">The announcement the other day by the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Poots, was unhelpful. It adds to the uncertainty for businesses and citizens in Northern Ireland. It seems to me that it was a political decision rather than one based on the public interest. It is noteworthy that his decision is not supported by the Northern Ireland Executive or by the majority of members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Whether people agree with the protocol, surely on democratic grounds it was not the right decision to make, as it was done without the assent of the Executive and without the support of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">For a number of years I have been raising the issue of vacant, now derelict, homes on what was formerly the St. Ita's Hospital campus with the Department of Health. It has now been passed and I have been engaging with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Fingal County Council. There appears to be no resistance on the part of any of the entities I am engaging with to redeveloping these houses and bringing them back into use as homes, but there is a fair amount of buck passing taking place. It does not rest solely with one Department. The HSE owns the site but does not have the capability to develop the houses. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has the capability to instruct Fingal County Council to develop the houses, but it does not own the land. I am reminded of the old advertisement on the television in which people used to say that one could not get a job without experience, but one could not get experience without a job. It appears that it just requires somebody to provide a little leadership. I urge the Tánaiste, as the deputy Head of Government, to bring these three entities - Fingal County Council, the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - together and get these homes redeveloped. They are badly needed. They have been allowed to fall into dereliction and they must be brought back into use.</p>

I am aware of dozens of older people who are approved for a home support service but because resources are limited the HSE cannot follow through on its commitments. The HSE can outsource hours where required. I know all agencies are finding it difficult to secure staff at present, but why do a number of people I represent have to wait up to seven months? They are still waiting. In some situations on which I have worked I have sourced reputable private providers to provide the service, yet the HSE tells me it will not sign off on it. Can the Minister of State expand on this?</p>

          <p eId="para_499">I thank the Deputy for raising that issue. We have spoken about it previously. The Government has provided, both last year and this year, €666 million for home care. That is a phenomenal amount of money. It is a huge increase and is very welcome. In 2021, we managed to deliver 2.7 million more hours than in 2020, with 55,000 people receiving home care supports. My problem, at present, is not a financial issue, because I have the money to fund almost all the home care supports. The issue is the recruitment of staff. Currently, there are just under 5,000 people who have been funded, but we are waiting for staff. In the Deputy's area, community healthcare organisation, CHO 4, the HSE is carrying out a targeted recruitment campaign. It is trying to employ 300 people through the HSE in Cork and Kerry because we are acutely aware of this. What we are doing now with recruitment is targeting specific areas. There are real issues at the weekends, especially in rural areas, but we are working very hard to resolve them.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">Just before the most recent budget, I proposed a discretionary fund because while I welcome the €100, we need to consider a targeted measure for households that will struggle.

I call on the Tánaiste to look at a discretionary fund, particularly for the cost of energy. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has been putting that proposal forward for quite some time. It spends millions each year assisting families. I would like to see that implemented, if possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_504">That Dáil Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to accept the following measure:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_505">Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2021 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_506">a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 31st January, 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Today, I am seeking the approval of the House to proceed with the formal opt-in to the new round of the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, AMIF. Under the AMIF, the EU provides financial support for a comprehensive approach to the management of migration in the European Union. As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is required to formally opt in to certain EU home affairs instruments under arrangements in place for non-Schengen member states. This includes the new 2021-2027 AMIF programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The opt-in process requires both Government and Oireachtas approval. I obtained Government approval at the Government meeting last week and this motion is being moved in both Houses of the Oireachtas today. The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund is an important means of supporting some of our most vulnerable migrant communities, including refugees and asylum seekers. It is exclusively targeted at non-EU nationals. The funding is used both by my Department and the Department of Justice to finance a wide range of asylum, migration and integration programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> The fund was adopted by EU member states in 2021. Its overall policy objective at the EU level is to contribute to the efficient management of migration flows and to the implementation, strengthening and development of the EU common policy on asylum and the common immigration policy. Within this overall objective, the fund is intended to contribute to the following specific objectives: strengthening and developing all aspects of the common European asylum system, including its external dimensions; strengthening and developing legal migration to the member states in accordance with their economic and social needs, and promoting and contributing to the effective integration and social inclusion of third-country nationals; contributing to countering irregular migration, enhancing effective, safe and dignified return and readmission, and promoting and contributing to effective initial reintegration in third countries; and enhancing solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility between the member states, in particular as regards those most affected by migration and asylum challenges, including through practical co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Under the framework of these objectives, each member state develops its own national programme setting out how it intends to use the fund at the national level in support of these objectives. Ireland opted into the previous Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, which ran from 2014 to 2020, and to the two funds that preceded it, namely, the European Integration Fund and the European Refugee Fund. Ireland's likely allocation under the new fund will be determined when the opt-in process is completed. Under the previous AMIF, the State was allocated some €55.5 million across the areas of asylum, integration and return.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> Since 2016, my Department and previously the Department of Justice and Equality have used AMIF funding to support NGO-led migrant integration programmes, aspects of the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP, and the returns programme operated by the Department of Justice for international protection applicants whose claims have not been successful, or who choose to return to their home country.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The AMIF is distributed by my Department in a number of ways in order to help Ireland meet its objectives under an agreed national programme. Specifically, my Department administers open calls for proposals and provides grant funding to successful applicants, typically NGOs working in the area of migrant integration; provides direct awards to certain bodies that have unique ability to perform specific measures; and provides funds to assist the return of third-country nationals to their country of origin, on both a voluntary and involuntary basis, under a returns programme operated by the Department of Justice. Under the open call process, organisations can submit proposals for programmes and projects to address the asylum and integration objectives of the national programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The first open call process under the previous AMIF took place in 2016 and following an assessment process 20 projects nationwide were awarded grants totalling €4.5 million. A second open call process was run in 2019 where a further €4.5 million was distributed to 19 successful organisations. Subject to completion of the opt-in to the 2021-2027 AMIF programme, it is intended that my Department will run another open call for proposals later in 2022, once a national programme for the new fund has been developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The range of projects funded under AMIF is broad. For example, under the open calls process for AMIF 2014-2020, Gaisce was funded to provide an opportunity for young asylum seekers, refugees and third country nationals to achieve a Gaisce award by improving personal and physical skills and undertaking community involvement, team challenges and an "adventure journey". There are many benefits for this group in completing Gaisce awards, including improved confidence and well-being, and positive mental health and social inclusion, which are especially important given the difficult circumstances these young people may have encountered.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Another type of project funded under AMIF is run by Spirasi, which works to ensure that victims of torture receive the supports they need to support healing and recovery. They are offered educational and psychosocial supports to enable their integration into normal life after traumatic episodes of torture. These are just a small sample representative of the many worthwhile projects funded under the 2014-2020 programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Under the 2014-2020 programme, three direct awards totalling €3.9 million have been granted to the Irish refugee protection programme, which is operated by my Department to resettlement work. The funding has supported selection missions to Lebanon, transport for beneficiaries and the integration of beneficiaries here in Ireland. In 2019, the HSE received a direct award of €990,000 to fund the Safetynet project. This is a mobile health screening service which visits direct provision centres to provide medical screening to asylum seekers.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Under AMIF rules, my Department has also availed of a technical assistance budget of €2.56 million from Ireland's allocation. This supports the funds administration unit in my Department to effectively administer the AMIF funds in Ireland. Technical assistance will also be available under the new fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Each participating member state must produce a national programme setting out its objectives and plans for how the funding will be deployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">National programmes are normally drafted following consultation with relevant interests in the State, including NGOs, as well as with the European Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the fund's administration. Subject to approval for the opt-in, my Department will lead the development of a national programme for Ireland for the next set of funding. This new national programme will cover the main areas of the fund, namely asylum; legal migration; integration; resettlement; countering irregular migration; returns; and solidarity measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> In developing the new national programme, my Department will consult with stakeholders in the areas of asylum, migration and integration, including relevant NGOs and Departments, to include the Department of Justice, which will continue to manage funded activities in the areas of migration and return. Members will all be aware of the extensive work under way in my Department to implement the White Paper to end direct provision, which I published almost one year ago. This is a priority area for the Government as we seek to replace the direct provision system with a new model that is better able to support the independence, autonomy and right to family life of asylum seekers.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Respect for human rights, early integration, and partnership with the not-for-profit sector are essential principles of the new model we are now putting in place. Work is progressing well in my Department and across the Government to implement the policy changes set out in the White Paper. While there remains much preparatory work to be done, at our current rate of progress we anticipate that the first moves from direct provision centres into the new independent accommodation provided under the new model will commence later this year. In developing the new programme AMIF, we will ensure it provides opportunities for AMIF funding to support these reforms. Subject to Oireachtas approval of the opt-in, the relevant EU bodies will be informed and work on the national programme can begin. I commend the motion to the House and seek Members' support.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_522">This is an important debate and we are glad to be engaged in it because the fund and the initiatives and policies for which it provides money are important and deserve debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> I wish to raise a number of matters. The first relates to EU migration policy as a whole. We face a migration crisis brought by war, climate change and systematic discrimination, especially in Africa and the Middle East. The easiest thing to do - it is, unfortunately, the path some other EU member states and institutions wish to take - is to pull up the drawbridge and to treat this as not our problem and not to concern ourselves with it. The shredding of international law related to refugee and asylum matters that comprises much of EU policy was opposed by Sinn Féin through our representatives in the European Parliament, but these changes seem to be progressing nonetheless, to be implemented in a number of other ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> One of the more notable examples is the EURODAC database, which records and stores the fingerprints of migrants for the EU in order to implement the Dublin protocol. Last year a proposal was brought which would see the minimum age for recording of fingerprints on the database brought down from 14 years of age to only six years of age. While this obscenity was done to prevent child trafficking, the implications of this amount of surveillance on minors cannot be ignored. A humane migration policy cannot be built on violating the human rights of those who are fleeing prosecution. Although EURODAC comes under the Department of Justice's purview, it is important to raise and discuss it when discussing EU funding for these matters because it crosses many Departments. The EU also has to grapple increasingly with the urgent need for further programmes of refugee acceptance, which we have seen with regard to Syria and, more recently, in Afghanistan. Those who worked in EU institutions and for America in Afghanistan cannot be left at the mercy of the situation there. While other rescue missions might be difficult, the State should look to accept as many as is practical to come into this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Turning to matters specifically under the Department's responsibility, the goal of integration is, of course, an important one, and the fund and the programme that encourages it should enjoy support. However, the material basis of society is what aids integration the most. Where people are pitted against one another for resources and where austerity often prevails, racism will find a more welcoming environment. Integration programmes will not work if housing or healthcare policy is not working. All of these things have to be doing their job. We in Sinn Féin have policies in those areas, which everyone is aware of.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> Housing, in particular, will be key to ending direct provision, which, to the Minister's credit, he has made a priority. It is worth putting on record what the Government's White Paper has stated on the matter of accommodation as it was released last year. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_527"> - Houses and/or apartments will be built and/or acquired through approved housing bodies or equivalent organisations. This option will be used for families and single people, particularly vulnerable single people.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_528"> - Buildings will be repurposed through urban renewal initiatives to create accommodation for single people.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_529"> - Rent a room schemes will be used to source some of the accommodation for single people.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_530"> - Private tenancies will be used to source accommodation for families as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It should be noted that the latter two of these four options explicitly rely on the private rental market. While we are all heartened by the stories of people accepting Syrian refugees into their homes, it is not a long-term policy solution, and rent-a-rooms comprise part of the private rental market, meaning they offer poor protection to tenants where there is inflation of prices. The last option is unambiguously focused on private rental, which echoes the Government's failed HAP policies, and recent responses to parliamentary questions do not fill me with confidence as they mention the acquisition of turn-key properties. In and of itself this is not an issue, but there are now multiple agencies bidding against one another and this has the potential to cause further inflation and to condemn refugees to possibly lower standards of end accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Sinn Féin was clear that the investment into approved housing bodies options was key, especially if purpose-built accommodation is to be constructed. My colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, in a recent paper about the true level of homelessness in this country, revealed that there were 1,640 people who had received leave to remain but were still living in direct provision. The reason for this is very simple: there is nowhere else for them to go due to the shortage of housing. Refugees are particularly vulnerable to discrimination within the private rental market, and I think the Minister is aware of that. Accommodation needs to be provided on a non-profit basis. That is really important. I call on the Minister to start publishing a pipeline report for accommodation to be provided under her Department. Of course, this fund will provide money for that. The report should say what accommodation is forthcoming and by what means it is to be built or acquired. This is incredibly important as it is the stated aim of the Government to essentially clear out the current system before new applicants are brought into the reform system. If we are to clear out the direct provision system now, obviously there will have to be space to put these people. That is the real issue. The inclusion of asylum seekers as part of the undocumented scheme, which I was surprised to see, when the Minister could have just provided leave to remain for these people instead, clearly seems to be part of that policy. Direct provision must be ended humanely. A fudge, where the private rental market would have to provide the accommodation for nearly 9,000 extra people, is simply not going to work and is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">The Labour Party supports Ireland's opt-in to the 2021-2027 asylum, migration and integration fund. We take issue, however, with some of the on-the-ground reality within the European Union towards refugees. Statistics released by the Greek Government and confirmed by the UNHCR set the total number of arrivals to Greece in 2021 at 8,000, of which roughly half arrived by sea. The Greek ministry for maritime affairs, however, reports more than 29,000 rescues by the Hellenic Coast Guard in the same period, with just 25,000 people remaining unaccounted for. The reality of the EU's hostility towards migrants and asylum seekers was brought into sharp focus when Irish citizen, Seán Binder, was arrested and charged for crimes carrying up to a 25-year sentence for joining other activists and NGO workers in rescuing African migrants who had got into difficulty in the Aegean Sea. There is a clear issue within the European Union with pushbacks and with migration and integration in practice. Each one of these figures is a human life, yet there are ministers in European governments parroting that it is positive to have low migration flows into Europe. This is true only if refugees are not fleeing; it is an overwhelming negative if refugees are seeking asylum but numbers remain low or decrease. It means that Europe is an unwelcome place that does not believe that desperate people deserve refuge. Ireland is not an outlier in this regard and we must do far more before we can accuse others of not pulling their weight.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> We in the Labour Party welcome the regularisation programme for undocumented people living in Ireland announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, this week. We also welcome the parallel programme being opened for people in Ireland's asylum system. Regarding the regularisation scheme, however, my colleague, Deputy Bacik, has been critical of the decision to discount time spent in the asylum system when calculating an applicant's time spent living in Ireland. Many people will find they are eligible for neither scheme as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We in Labour see this as punishing people for being trapped in a system which this State has acknowledged is inefficient. While the scheme is welcome and is a tribute to the work of the Green Party in government, it could have been much more generous. Last year my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith questioned the Department of Justice regarding the status of refugees and asylum seekers in direct provision and raised the potential for an amnesty to give these applicants citizenship in order to alleviate many of the very serious issues they face and enable those people to find and obtain accommodation where they could live safely during this unprecedented pandemic. We cannot allow human beings to be treated as lesser people. We must completely overhaul our asylum system and we must grant a citizenship amnesty to all asylum seekers and refugees currently resident in Ireland. We must treat all people of Ireland with dignity and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I support the programme announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and any such move is definitely progress. Why could this program not be broadened to capture more people who are living and working in Ireland in circumstances of great uncertainty? Someone who is living here, working here, paying tax here and contributing to Irish society belongs here. They are one of us; they are us. The country of céad míle fáilte has a long way to go to live up to that ethos and it begins with conversations like this. When we see these positive moves, why do we need to ask why it is limited?</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Every week I deal with people who are in these exact scenarios. They work in our communities and contribute to our society. Their kids play on our sports teams and are involved in local community groups. We are all richer for them. We must show basic reality and humanity and be sure we never tell somebody they do not belong.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I draw the Minister's attention to a piece published in the <i>Dublin Inquirer</i> this week from Shamim Malekmian. Her piece highlights the ongoing failure to provide long-promised immigration detention centres. In 2021 people who were refused entry to Ireland at our borders were forced to await deportation in prisons. There is sparse information on the numbers of people who are detained in prison for this reason because data are not collected in the absence of a dedicated immigration detention facility. Such a facility was to have been opened in 2020. It is inhumane to detain people in Garda stations and prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Another EU directive, the return directive to which Ireland is not a signatory, requires that immigration detention must take place in a specialised facility and that all those detained should have access to legal experts and free legal aid. This is not currently in place. People detained include those seeking asylum. Seeking asylum is not a crime. It is a fundamental human right to be respected by states. Ireland should move immediately to correct this alarming situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_540">The Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund is a mechanism to address issues relating to the lack of integration and diversity in sectors of Irish society. While we pride ourselves on being welcoming people, the reality can be very different for migrants and people of colour who experience anything from microaggression to racially motivated attacks. The recent incident of performers from "The Lion King" musical being subjected to racial abuse in Dublin is just one of many examples we could draw on. The State needs to direct its resources to ensure greater equality and integration. The Government still claims that 2024 is the target for ending direct provision, but the slow pace does not indicate to those trapped in the system that this will be achieved. We still have entire families in congregated settings often separated from the local communities, with integration being left to very dedicated local volunteers and the good faith of schools, doctors and community organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> When I raised this issue last July, the Minister assured me that families and children are being moved to independent living accommodation, which is most welcome. However, he neglected to mention that families may be moved considerable distances. In one case, a family was moved from Cork to Donegal, ignoring the children's integration in their schools or the support network the family had built up over years in the area. The International Protection Accommodation Service is trying to solve one problem while creating a whole new set of issues. Where is the consideration of the people involved? If integration is the goal, why is it not taken seriously in making these decisions?</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> Gender-based violence has rightly been a major focus recently. Migrant girls and women are disproportionately represented in statistics. They are particularly vulnerable due to different factors such as their migration status, ability to speak English and the type of work in which they are predominantly employed. Shortly before Christmas, representatives of the Migrants Rights Centre Ireland presented to the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. They pointed out that migrant women continue to experience barriers in exiting situations of domestic violence and accessing support services. Women are fearful because their status is linked to a partner's entitlement to retain immigration status following a separation from a partner. While there have been some limited measures to address this, we need proper reform in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> These situations raise the question about how the immigration system makes migrants more vulnerable. For example, undocumented people often do not access services or report crimes for fear it will result in their deportation. The scheme to regularise undocumented people is an important development, but we need guarantees or a firewall approach that prevents information being passed from, for example, the Department of Social Protection to the Department of Health, or from the Department of Health to the immigration office.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Stable diverse communities are an essential pillar of integration. For the most part it happens naturally in neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces. For this to happen we need accessible and affordable housing. Migrants and minorities are over-represented in homelessness figures. We need a whole-of-government approach to integration to understand these interconnected issues. These are just some examples. Migrants, people of colour, Travellers and others experience discrimination in different ways every day. Some of these barriers are a matter of policy and need to be changed. Others relate to interventions around training and support, which can be paid for by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> However, the fund is also used for return management and countering irregular migration. Many Irish people are deeply uncomfortable with the reality behind these phrases. Migrants drowning in the Mediterranean and deaths in south-east Europe, especially in winter, such as the case of 12 migrants who froze to death near Turkey's border with Greece this week, represent a failure to understand and respond adequately to the situation. These aspects of the fund are very concerning and need greater scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> We need to push for the progressive use of the fund, not putting the lives of migrants at risk. The previous Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund was used to support organisations working in the area, including, Nasc, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, and in Cork city Gaisce and Cork ETB. There was also investment in schemes providing employment readiness training and diversity training in schools. We need to use the current fund to further this type of work and to foster the type of Ireland the vast majority of Irish people want.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">As we know, this motion on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund is coming up for adoption today. It is interesting to read the regulations from the EU governing this fund. As I read the document, I wondered what the real intention of it was. It seems clear to me that it is to stop immigration to the EU from war-torn and economically fragile African and Middle Eastern countries. Paragraph 9 states that given that certain actions taken outside the Union contribute to the achievement of the fund's objectives under certain circumstances it may bring the Union added value, which means stopping people getting here so we will not have to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> The fund should support the strengthening of partnerships with third countries for the purpose of managing migration. We can take this as meaning countries such as Libya which are totally dysfunctional thanks to military action taken by France and the UK on behalf of oil companies in our name in years gone by. The EU is happy for migrants to be pushed back to countries where there is no functioning government and placed in camps and prisons with untold danger for them simply because they wanted a better life for themselves and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The regulation also states that the best interests of the child should be the primary consideration in all actions or decisions concerning children in migration. I ask the Minister in his summing up to explain how that will be achieved by this regulation. What role will countries like Libya play in partnership with us in ensuring that the best interests of the child are taken care of? It is sickening to say "in partnership with us" about the dysfunctional Libyan Government, but it is now one of our partners because of this document and the implications of this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I could go on to say more about this policy, but time is of the essence. I know this is about the adoption of specific regulations here in Ireland, but it is part of the overall European document which we obviously had a role in drafting.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">These are important issues that affect how the process for asylum seekers will be implemented in Ireland and that needs to be addressed too.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_556">I will reluctantly support the motion. The fund is very positive, although I have the greatest reservations about the regulation on which it is based and, like my colleague, about the theory behind it. It seems to be the building-up of a fortress Europe while giving a little money this way to calm the masses and dissent. In that context, I will support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I have a number of questions about the fund. This is our third time getting it. How was the money broken down on the previous occasion? I have some concern also about the money being used for the return of people to other countries. I would love to see the breakdown of that if one exists. I could not see it but that might be my fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> The undocumented scheme is very positive. It was developed as a result of organisations on the ground pointing out the necessity for it. The Minister acted on that, and I am delighted. Nevertheless, there seem to be two parallel processes in being. Those under the undocumented scheme will get a stamp 4 visa after having been here for two years, and there is also the group of asylum seekers. Those under the undocumented scheme can come forward and apply, whereas for asylum seekers, it rests with the Department of Justice to come forward and tell people who are resident in the various institutions. There are two such places in Galway. The power, therefore, does not rest with those seeking benefit under this. The Minister might clarify that, as well as whether the six-month supply exists for asylum seekers living in those institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The Minister might clarify also the contradiction in the Catherine Day report. Those under the asylum seeker process must wait for the Department of Justice to come forward, at which point they can get their stamp 4 visa for two years. The report of the Catherine Day advisory group called for a once-off simplified case-processing approach applying to all applicants who have been in the system for two years or more. It recommended they get five years. There are so many different recommendations and systems that run parallel here that it is utterly confusing. We put great store in the Catherine Day report, and the only difficulty I had related to the proposal for housing, as Deputy Martin Kenny outlined, and the reliance on the private market, which was always going to be a disaster. Other than that, Catherine Day and the report have got unanimous support and praise.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> The case-processing approach was one of the strong recommendations in the report, and there was also a recommendation to address the practical problems such as the cost of applying and so on. In addition, other groups have been excluded from the scheme. I do not expect one scheme to sort out all the problems, but it is important that the Department would conduct an analysis of those affected by exclusion. We are looking after one group, of approximately 17,000, including 3,000 children, but we are excluding other groups, such as people who have lost their status under non-EU rules. Such persons, if they are married to someone in the EU, are no longer able to get what they used to. Different groups are always excluded and there is an onus on the Department to analyse that. When there is one positive outcome, the Department must ask what the problems with that are. I will stop there because I am out of time.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T14:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_561">I thank all the Deputies for their contributions. To respond to Deputy Connolly on the breakdown, under the 2014-2020 scheme, Ireland had €55.5 million allocated. I have to hand a copy of the percentages for each of the areas. A total of 30% of the national allocation was spent on asylum, 32% on integration, 22% on return, 5.8% on solidarity and 10% on technical assistance. Under the regulations, that was the requirement for Ireland. Many of the groups she and other Deputies spoke about received their funding allocation coming from those. In my opening remarks, I highlighted a couple of the really good projects that have been financed over the past six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Many Deputies spoke with accuracy in regard to the issues with large-scale EU migration and the EU's approach to migration. It is important to recognise what Ireland has done as a country over recent years and particularly during the Covid pandemic to recognise the crises that exist in regard to our ongoing support for Syrian refugees coming to this country through the IRPP. Just over 550 Syrian refugees came to Ireland in 2021. I had the privilege, and the difficult task, of visiting a Syrian refugee camp in November of last year and saw the conditions in which Syrians have been living there for almost a decade following the civil war. I met Syrians who will be moving to Ireland and starting a new life here and spoke to members of the Jordanian Government, which has done a great deal to offer support. Approximately 20% of the Jordanian population now comprises Syrian refugees, and they are given the same level of social supports and of access to Covid vaccines. I was very impressed with Jordan's support for and solidarity with its neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> We also acted swiftly in the context of Afghanistan. A total of 550 emergency visas have been offered to Afghan citizens. More than 400 Afghans have already come to this country and, again, many throughout the country are being supported through the community sponsorship programme. We fulfilled our commitment towards unaccompanied minors, 28 of whom we received from Lesbos in the latter part of last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about the White Paper and our moves to discuss accommodation. As Deputy Connolly highlighted, the Catherine Day report is a fantastic document, but it recommended going down the HAP route. It indicated HAP should be the majority way in which provision for asylum seekers, while they await that determination, is met. We disagreed with that, which is why, in the White Paper, HAP is not the central focus. Rather, the central focus relates to build and purchase. That is what we are committed to doing and it is what we are working on, but we have to recognise we are creating a long-term system that will have ebbs and flows, and we have to build flexibility into it. At some point, some of that flexibility may involve HAP or other methods, but the central part of what we are doing relates to build and buy, in a way that does not conflict with the activities of local authorities. That is why we have worked closely with the Housing Agency and some of those larger bodies, particularly for single accommodation. We are not competing with families for the likes of a three-bed semi-detached house, given we are looking for something different, at least in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> I welcome the support for the regularisation scheme, a very important scheme. I disagree with what was said about it being restrictive. It is a very broad approach. Other than a recognition that people have to have been living in the country for a period, namely, three years if they have children or four if they do not, it is a very broad approach for dealing with undocumented people and it is designed to bring people out of the shadows and into being registered and regularised in order that they can fully enjoy all the rights and protections everyone else does.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I welcome also the provision for people in international protection and direct provision at the moment. The Department of Justice will notify those who have been in the international protection application process for more than two years as to whether they are eligible for the scheme. A period of two years is the cut-off point of eligibility for the scheme. Obviously, it is then up to the individual. He or she can decide to apply for the regularisation scheme or, of course, continue on his or her existing international protection application. We are making that as flexible as possible, recognising that people have a right to apply for international protection. No one will be forced to apply under the regularisation scheme but it is an option for them. Particularly in the case of people who have been in the system for a long period, perhaps having gone through judicial reviews and the like or having lived in limbo for many years, this offers an opportunity to allow them to establish a status for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I welcome the House's support for the motion.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_568">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time".</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I am very pleased to introduce the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill today. The Tánaiste was very anxious that we get the legislation in place. I thank all involved in the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, process who have been working on it for the last year and everyone who was involved in my Department and in the Department of Social Protection. I want to single out Ms Clare Dunne, an assistant secretary general who retired before Christmas. She was instrumental in making sure this legislation and many other pieces of legislation were brought through the Houses. I want to recognise her work and retirement. I want to thank Dara Breathnach for her assistance here today. I am conscious that many colleagues across the House will have raised this as an issue that needed to be dealt with in a timely manner. The Bill reflects the concerns that most people have raised with us in the last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> This short and technical Bill will resolve an issue arising for some employees who were laid off during the period of greatest Covid-19 related restrictions or who may be laid off over the next three-year period. The Tánaiste was clear that this had to be dealt with clearly and this Bill sets out to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> This Government has provided an extensive range of supports for businesses and employees affected by sometimes prolonged closures during the pandemic. We have made every effort, with significant cross-party support, to assist workers and employers. We have provided the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to workers who were laid off. We have supported businesses in maintaining the employer-employee relationship, first through the TWSS and then the EWSS. When restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened, we have supported them by providing extensive sector-specific guidance and reopening grants. While we all recognise that these supports go a long way to help maintain businesses and jobs we recognise that no matter what supports we put in place, they cannot replace all the lost revenue and all the grief and hassle that businesses and employees have gone through over the last two years. I want to recognise again the efforts by all those in the work environment, employers and employees, who went to great lengths to try to provide services and reach their customers and maintain business as much as they possibly could during the Covid pandemic and who followed all the procedures set out by the Government and the Department of Health in trying to protect themselves, their employees and their customers from the virus. That came at a great cost to businesses and I want to recognise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> Despite a difficult few weeks after the arrival of the omicron variant, the results are clear. Many sectors of the economy have bounced back remarkably quickly. Our public finances are in a far better position than we could have reasonably expected last summer, although they are still under pressure and we have had high costs to deal with Covid. However, conditions are certainly improving. Government supports have played their part, but most of all this is a credit to the resilience of businesses and workers, especially in our domestic SME sector. Omicron was a setback. The number of people in receipt of PUP increased from 55,000 at the end November, to almost 67,000 in early January. This was an inevitable result of the new precautions to reduce the spread of omicron when the scientific information was not available to tell us how serious it would be. However, we should put this in context. The highest-ever number of people on PUP was more than 600,000 back in May 2020. The highest number last year, back in February, was more than 486,000. The reduction in PUP claimants late last year was not just because the payment level was being tapered off but was mainly because of people returning to employment. The most recent figures available show that in quarter 3 of last year we had the largest number of people ever in employment, at more than 2.47 million people. As we move in the coming days and weeks to ease the omicron precautions and back towards full reopening, we have good reason to be optimistic for recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> However, we acknowledge that the recovery will not be universal and sustained over all businesses in all sectors. Some businesses will not resume with their previous capacity. Some may fail entirely. Some of this is simply a normal part of the economic cycle but some will be the result of the fall-out from Covid over the past two years. Whether it happens as part of the normal economic cycle or because of the pandemic, business downsizing or closure usually leads to redundancies. This takes me to the point of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> As it stands, a person who qualifies for redundancy under the Redundancy Payments Acts is generally entitled to two weeks' pay per year of service, plus a week extra. This statutory entitlement is capped at pay up to €600 per week. This is known as statutory redundancy, and is the minimum owed to the employee by the employer. Periods spent on short time imposed by the employer are counted as normal service for these purposes, and do not reduce the amount owed to the employee. However, and here is why this Bill is needed, periods spent on lay-off within the final three years of an employee’s service do not count as reckonable service for the purposes of statutory redundancy payments. This means that a person who was laid off because of the essential Covid-19 related restrictions will not have that period counted as reckonable service if they are made redundant within three years of the end of the emergency period. This Bill addresses that issue. It strikes a careful balance. We could simply deem the period to be reckonable service, but that would make the employer liable for the redundancy payment in the first instance. That would not be fair, as the Covid restrictions were completely outside employers’ control. We have had legal advice that explained that not only was it unfair, it would not be correct legally either. Furthermore, making an employer liable could potentially risk their viability. Everyone across the Houses wants to support businesses to support those jobs, not jeopardise them. If we do not support businesses and put too much pressure on them, the knock-on effect can be job losses. Instead, we provide for a payment by the State to the employee. This will be known as the Covid-19 related lay-off payment. The payment will cover the difference between the statutory redundancy payment due to the employee, and the amount to which they would have been entitled had they not been laid off due to public health restrictions during the emergency period. The "emergency period" is the period from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021, inclusive. This is the period during which restrictions were at their greatest.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Employees were also restricted from invoking their normal right to trigger a redundancy to help preserve the employer-employee relationship. That right was restored from 1 October 2021. The criteria for accessing the Covid-19-related lay-off payment will be first, that the employee qualifies for redundancy; second, that the employee was laid off due to Covid-19 restrictions for a period or periods between 13 March 2020 and 30 September 2021; and finally, that the employee is made redundant before 30 September 2024. </p>
          <p eId="para_576"> There is an in-built sunset clause in the legislation by virtue of the fact that only periods of lay-off in the final three years of employment are disregarded as reckonable service. That is why the date of 30 September 2024 has been selected. </p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Department of Social Protection will administer the payment scheme on my Department’s behalf, as the funds will be coming through the Social Insurance Fund. I want to thank the officials in both Departments for their work on this over the last 18 months or so and all those who fed into the conversation. I recognise that employers and unions were anxious that this was resolved. In the early stages of restrictions, when section 12A kicked in, no one expected that the emergency would continue for as long as it did. We probably all assumed that it would be temporary and that it would not arise as an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> They are at an advanced stage in the development and resourcing of the necessary systems. I would like to take the opportunity to thank them and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for the tremendous work they have put into this. They hope to have that system up and running in quarter 2 so that they can administer payments from there. The scheme will be employer-led in the first instance. This should not be onerous for them as many employers are already very familiar with Department of Social Protection processes. There will also be provision for an employee to make direct application if, for whatever reason, their employer fails or refuses to do so. This includes, for example, where an employer may already have closed permanently. There have been some casualties over the last two years already from the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> We expect that payments should be able to commence in the first half of this year, after the passage and commencement of this Bill. It is very difficult to say what the costs of this will be, as they will be demand driven. We will not see the full picture until September 2024. Hopefully, the numbers will be much less than any of us would have feared at the start.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> As I noted at the outset, our businesses and employees have shown themselves to be remarkably resilient in the face of a very challenging period. We have many reasons for optimism that suggest the costs should be manageable.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Initial funding of €10 million has been allocated for 2022. However, the costs will be demand-driven, and funding will be available to match the drawdown. The Department of Social Protection and my Department will monitor the position carefully as applications come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> This Bill is short and technical but it will make a clear and positive difference to people's lives. It acknowledges and compensates for reckonable service that employees have been unable to accrue due to pandemic closures. It protects businesses from additional costs as they strive to regain their footing in a still-difficult environment. It is business and worker friendly and recognises the tremendous impact of Covid-19 restrictions on everybody concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I intend to amend the Bill on Committee Stage or Report Stage to correct a cross-referencing error in the recently enacted Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021. The Government will be asked to agree to that amendment. The relevant provision has not yet been commenced. I would like to use the early opportunity presented by the Bill to make the necessary minor amendment. I will talk to Members when I have the wording for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I look forward to Deputies' contributions on this Bill. I thank Deputy O'Reilly and others who have contributed to the conversation on this challenge over the past two years as we have tried to find the best way to deal with the issue arising from the temporary lay-offs.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">I am sharing time with my colleagues. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. It involves a short but important piece of work, which we in Sinn Féin will be supporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> The Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is a specific response to decisions taken at the beginning of the pandemic whereby section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was suspended. This was done to protect workers from being made redundant. Employers were also protected in that they would not have a deluge of workers applying for redundancy payments. However, with this decision several technical difficulties arose for workers, specifically workers laid off or on short time, such as those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment. The Minister of State will know this because he and I have spoken about it on more than one occasion. Some of the workers were concerned that they would not have the fair calculation of reckonable service if they were unfortunate enough to be made redundant, and as a result they were genuinely afraid that they would then lose out on significant sums of money regarding a redundancy claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and the trade union movement in general spotted this very early on in the pandemic. I introduced a Bill last March, the Redundancy Payments (Lay off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021, the aim of which was similar to that of the Bill before the House, namely, to ensure workers would not lose out on time when it came to the calculation of a redundancy entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The Bill before us is very welcome. It was dealt with by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year. Many concerns were cleared up by the departmental officials in attendance, whom I thank for their time and patience on the day. I was not at the meeting myself because I was isolating with Covid, but I followed the proceedings online. My colleague, Senator Paul Gavan, had queries answered on the occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The main aim of this Bill is to provide for a once-off redundancy payment to workers in respect of certain lay-off periods during the period beginning on 13 March and ending at the end of September 2021. Under the Redundancy Payments Act, statutory redundancy is based on duration of service and a qualified employee is entitled to two weeks' pay per year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a cap of €600 in earnings per week, payable by the employer. Under the existing Act, periods of lay-off in the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service, meaning that redundancy entitlements will not factor in those periods. Therefore, that would result in a loss in regard to redundancy payments. Thankfully, that is addressed within the Bill. It ensures affected workers can access a tax-free State payment of up to €1,860, financed by the Social Insurance Fund, to compensate for the break in their service caused by the pandemic and associated public-health restrictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> There are some additional issues I would like to raise with the Minister of State and that I hope can be addressed in the future. I introduced the Redundancy Payments (Lay off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021. This Bill went further than addressing the fair calculation of reckonable service alone; it sought to clarify some workers' rights issues that had arisen. One such issue concerned where an employer tried to hoodwink a worker and have them declare themselves as having resigned, thereby involuntarily forgoing their entitlement to a redundancy payment. I spoke to several workers - many of them women and migrant workers - who outlined how unscrupulous employers tried to con them into making themselves redundant by telling them they could resign, unbeknownst to them against their wishes. This would have resulted in the workers losing out on any redundancy entitlement. Perhaps the Minister of State could look into making it an offence for an employer to treat an employee as having resigned, thereby forgoing his or her redundancy entitlement, where he or she did not mean to resign. It has happened on several occasions that people felt they had no choice but to resign. In fact, it would be a redundancy situation in many instances. The employers were evading their responsibility. I am not referring to all employers and it is not a massive issue, but it is certainly an issue for the people who have contacted me, who are predominantly women and migrant workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> I want to raise some operational matters with the Minister of State. The scheme cannot be launched until the legislation has made its way through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am aware that the Department of Social Protection will deliver the scheme. It is establishing the necessary application system. Has the relevant information technology work been concluded? Will the system be ready to go live soon? Could we be given a date for when it is expected to go live? I ask because several workers who have been in contact with me are very anxious to know when it will happen, as the Minister of State can imagine.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> As I have said throughout, I will work with the Minister to get this legislation over the line as efficiently and effectively as possible, given that the application process is largely intended to be employer led in circumstances where employers have had to make people redundant over the course of the pandemic or will have to make them redundant in the coming years. I know this is expected to become part of the termination process, but, as regards the provision in the legislation for a worker to make an application to the Minister where an employer has refused to make an application for him or her, how is this going to work in practice? Will it be the same as always or will there be a separate line or a set of forms to be filled out?</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> The legislation states that an application is to be made in a manner to be determined by the Minister. Will it be directly up to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, or will it be up to the Minister for Social Protection? Will it fall between two stools such that it will not be anyone's responsibility? It would be helpful if the Minister of State could clarify whether the application will be online or paper based and how it will work in practice? The details on that would be very helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> We will support this legislation. It contains many of the aims and aspirations of the legislation I introduced . I will be happy to work with the Minister of State to get it through the Houses as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_595">I too am happy to speak on this Bill and to say Sinn Féin will be supporting it. Being made redundant can be one of the most traumatic experiences in a person's life. It can be especially difficult if it occurs all of a sudden, if the employee has been a long time in the job or sector and if the employee has huge commitments, such as rent, mortgage or family commitments. An older worker may find it very hard to get another job. The redundant person wonders whether he or she will get another job with equal or better pay or any decent job at all that reflects his or her skills and experience in the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> This Bill deals with a time of particular trauma for workers and small local employers, including the family businesses on which our economy is broadly built. In north Kildare, workers and small businesses were extremely worried about what lay ahead. We in Sinn Féin set out immediately to help them. This Bill deals with matters under the Redundancy Payments Act to allow for a once-off redundancy payment to workers with regard to certain lay-off periods from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. It is fair to say that, on New Year's Eve 2019, nobody could have imagined that the whole of Europe would be in lockdown within three months. The Covid lay-offs were extremely worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> As the Minister of State knows, we immediately recognised a legislative issue and proposed our own legislation to protect workers and employers and counteract any difficulty, as my colleague Deputy O'Reilly has already outlined. I am very glad to see this Bill closes the loophole whereby newly redundant workers would lose out on reckonable service while laid off due to public-health restrictions. This was a big worry for many workers in north Kildare. We were very anxious to reassure them that we would do what we could to protect them. We were approached by several workers who told us about employers who were trying to force them into redundancy on the sly or against their wishes. They were worried about their reckonable service.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> The Bill makes sure that one can access the special tax-free State payment of up to a maximum of €1,860, which is financed through the Social Insurance Fund. While this is quite a short Bill, it is a really important one in that it looks after workers who have sacrificed so much during this pandemic, especially those who had to sacrifice their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We are happy to support the Bill. We will do all we can to assist in its passage through the Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">I also welcome the Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill 2022. I thank Deputy O'Reilly of Sinn Féin, who brought a similar Bill forward on 18 March last year. Many hundreds of thousands of workers have faced a terrible time during the pandemic, especially during the periods when most businesses were ordered by the Government to shut down their operations. This caused enormous stress for workers. It is to be hoped this Bill will ensure that no workers will lose out through no fault of their own. I also welcome that the payment will be set at €1,860, as per the legislation on redundancy payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I will raise a point about the employers. I am concerned that the taxpayer will be picking up the entire cost of the redundancies, with a possible bill of up to €150 million. This is at the higher end of the estimates, but we will have to make provision for such sums of money. The paragraph on this in Oireachtas Library and Research Service resource on the Bill states, "The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment received legal advice to the effect that imposing the cost of the lay-off period [...] on employers would give rise to the constitutional issues and is fraught with legal risk". Will the Minister of State publish that legal advice and provide a briefing on the constitutional issues involved? We all know that many employers will do whatever they can to avoid paying a fair redundancy package to their employees even if they can afford it. I am not convinced that this provision will not be exploited by employers to allow them to get away with not paying their fair share of redundancy packages. It should not just be a matter of the statutory payment if employers can afford to contribute. Many Deputies have been on the picket line in support of workers, most recently the Debenhams workers. In that case, we saw a major multinational company do its utmost to avoid paying its workers a fair redundancy package that had already been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I welcome the Bill. We will do our best to ensure it passes as quickly as possible so that workers can get their rights and redundancy packages.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 suspended a worker's right to seek redundancy payments when laid off or put on short-time work due to the pandemic. Deputy Nash of the Labour Party tabled an amendment that would have dealt with this issue at the start of the pandemic and, perhaps, saved the State some share of the burden that may now be necessarily placed upon it. At the time, we agreed not to pursue the amendment as we were assured that the issue would be dealt with and we did not wish to delay emergency legislation. The unamended Covid legislation meant that any employee who ended up being made redundant would have had time during the pandemic excluded from any calculated period of redundancy if time spent laid off or on short-time work in the final three years of redundancy was not included in the original legislation. This Bill is being introduced to ensure there is a scheme to provide a State payment to make up for any time not counted because of time spent laid off during the pandemic. The fact that workers' minimum statutory payments will be made up by the State through a payment from the Social Insurance Fund in such cases should ensure that the worker will not be out of pocket with regard to their minimum payments in the event of being made redundant having been laid off during the pandemic. This is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Normally, under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, when a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund to an employee on an employer's behalf, a debt is raised against that employer. The Department of Social Protection is legally obliged to recover such debts from the employer. If this remains the case, the State will be able to pursue solvent employers. If there is an exemption, we will unfortunately have to put an extra burden on the State, which would not have been needed if this problem had been fixed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> In supporting the legislation as outlined, we appreciate that, at the time, the legislation was put forward because of the need for emergency measures. However, through Deputy Nash, we made an attempt to improve the original legislation. We feel that, if we had been listened to, there would not be a need for this measure now. Perhaps in future discussions between those of us in the Opposition and the Government, the Government will appreciate that the Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas come to this space with the best of intentions and from a place of knowledge. That is particularly true of my colleague, Deputy Nash. In that regard, while we support the Bill, we would encourage the Government to understand that many of us in this House are genuinely here to try to improve the lot of the worker and not to cause the Government unnecessary difficulty. We support the Bill and will be making further contributions as it goes through the Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">I welcome the opportunity to have a discussion on this Bill, which will benefit both employers and employees. I commend the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, on their ongoing efforts to support businesses and workers across the State. It would be remiss of me not to also acknowledge the work of others, particularly those on the relevant committee, for the work they put into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> This Bill is symbolic of a suite of measures that Government and my own party have taken to protect workers, while allowing the labour market and enterprises to grow even stronger. These measures include a wide range of improvements in the pay and conditions of workers across the State including, but not limited to, improvements in parental leave and the introduction of a new public holiday on 18 March and subsequently every St. Brigid's Day from 2023 onwards. We have also seen new measures brought in to protect workers' rights to keep their tips and gratuities. That was not only right but long overdue. Auto-enrolment for pensions will soon be introduced and the minimum wage has increased seven if not eight times over the last decade, since Fine Gael entered government. This has had a profound impact on the lives of workers. Furthermore, workers now have the right to request remote working with an option to appeal decisions to the Workplace Relations Commission, allowing for a more flexible and adaptable approach to work. Statutory sick pay will add another layer of protection for employees. It will be one less thing to worry about. A large amount of work has also gone into the introduction of a living wage in Ireland. I note the ongoing work of Deputy Nash on that matter along with the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar. Fine Gael has also remained steadfastly committed to the reduction of the tax burden on low and middle-income earners. This is an important step that cannot be overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The Opposition often attacks the Government, and Fine Gael specifically, with regard to workers' rights but, having named just a few recent successes, it is clear these are political charges not backed up by facts or the reality faced by workers every day. Progress must be recognised for what it is. I do not claim that we have got everything right, but I firmly believe that workers in Ireland are better off today than at any other time in the history of the State. We have an unprecedented 2.47 million people in employment. This is a remarkable achievement when one considers how matters stood in March 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> The country has gone into a radical recovery and, despite the challenges we have faced throughout the pandemic, we have emerged with strong growth forecasted for the years ahead. We have managed to do this because we entered into the pandemic from a position of strength. Indeed, during the pandemic, we saw swift and comprehensive action to protect both businesses and employees. We saw this in the introduction of the PUP, the wage subsidy scheme, etc. There can be no doubt that these measures made an invaluable contribution to people's lives during the pandemic and ensured that many businesses survived what was an unprecedented period. To my mind, these decisions reflected an attempt to be as fair and all-encompassing as possible in a time of global uncertainty and instability. I note that both Houses collectively supported virtually every measure that was introduced, particularly in 2020. Collectively, we worked extremely well under the circumstances to put in place the measures that were introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> This Bill is yet another effort and another example of the Government's continuing commitment to people and businesses. It will help employees recently made redundant who lost out on reckonable service during the emergency period, which has been extended until September next.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">It will ensure that employees will be able to avail of a special, tax-free, State payment of up to €1,860. It will allow employees to claim what is rightfully theirs.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The Tánaiste has demonstrated the foresight to ensure that the wave of redundancy claims will not impact on the ability of businesses to recover as we emerge from two years of restrictions and business closures. When the history of this pandemic is eventually written, it will show that the Government and, indeed, these Houses rose to the occasion and led our people safely through the fight against this deadly virus. It will also show that the Government, at every turn, has put people’s health and safety first and spared no expense in supporting people financially in the context of the decision to prioritise health.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> This is not an easy time, and many families have endured stress and worry regarding whether their jobs, companies or industries would be there when the restrictions were lifted. Given the numbers in employment and our economic recovery, which has been nothing short of miraculous, I hope this legislation, support for which has been demonstrated in the contributions thus far, will have a swift passage through the Houses and will be enacted as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">This is a short but important Bill, which Sinn Féin will be supporting. It will amend the principal Act to provide for once-off redundancy payments for workers in respect of certain lay-off periods from 13 March 2020 to 30 September 2021. My colleague, An Teachta O’Reilly, became aware of this problem early in the pandemic and has introduced the Redundancy Payments (Lay-off, Short Time and Calculation of Reckonable Service) Bill 2021 to the House to address this issue. An Teachta O’Reilly's Bill seeks to deliver a fair calculation of recognisable service for workers on the PUP who may lose out on significant sums of money in future redundancy payments. As matters stand, due to a loophole in the law, workers could lose out on significant sums because time spent on the PUP will not count when calculating entitlements. This Bill seeks to make that time reckonable service, which will ensure that workers will not have a lost year when it comes to future redundancy entitlements. When the PUP was introduced last year, redundancy entitlements were suspended for people who were temporarily laid off. Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, which ensured that employees were protected from being made redundant. Employers were also protected because the measure meant that a large number of workers were not applying for redundancy payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, statutory redundancy is based on duration of the service. Under the existing Act as well, periods of lay-offs during the final three years of service do not count as reckonable service. This means that redundancy entitlements will not factor in those periods. This legislation ensures that those workers can access a special tax-free State payment of up to €1,860, which will be provided for out of the Social Insurance Fund. Employers will not be liable for this compensatory repayment, which is only right. Such an imposition could endanger the viability of some businesses which would otherwise be able to recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> It was great to see measures being possible during the pandemic that were previously judged to be too socialist or too anti-private property rights to be introduced. I urge the Government to embrace its inner socialist and try to address the housing, education and health crises with a similar attitude.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">I apologise. I have come straight from the Committee on Public Accounts to the Chamber and I had to negotiate several flights of stairs in between.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Like many aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the full impact on the workforce is probably yet to be seen. It will likely take years for us to fully comprehend the massive shifts that have and are taking place. The Department’s estimate is that between 25,000 and 56,000 people are expected to be laid off as a result of Covid-19. It is not something that will only be experienced during the pandemic; it is a phenomenon that will continue and that will have residual effects. We are most likely to see these lay-offs in sectors which have yet to bounce back from the impact of Covid-19. I refer to the hospital sector, catering companies, leisure centres and firms involved in large-scale event work. Indeed, a great deal of tax has been warehoused and much extra debt has been accrued in specific sectors. Viability in that context is going to be determined by just how robust the recovery is. We also cannot assume that there will be no further interruptions, but let us hope not. There is a real issue in this regard, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> From March 2020 to September 2021, thousands of workers existed in a state of limbo. They had either been laid off or shifted onto part-time work during the pandemic. That was understandable. In many cases, they watched as their places of work struggled and they knew that in many cases their jobs were not going to be there for them to return to. I have encountered situations where people had been in a job for 20 years, for example, in a pub, and they were not sure if that pub was going to reopen. If it did reopen, and the people concerned had taken other jobs in the meantime, where would they stand then in respect of redundancy rights? I am talking about matters like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> The emergency measures introduced in March 2020 suspended workers' rights to seek redundancy from their employer. When that provision ended on 30 September, workers were left in a situation where they could be penalised under the terms of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, which does not recognise lay-off periods in the final three years of employment as reckonable service. Under those rules, Covid-19 lay-off periods would not be counted when workers' statutory redundancy was calculated. Thankfully, this Bill will amend that situation and bridge the gap in redundancy payments for those laid off during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is welcome that the Department is acting on this matter, and that it has engaged with SIPTU and ICTU on the issue. There will be quite a bit of that kind of patching up required in the context of the impact of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I note that the original intention was to have this Bill passed before Christmas. Unfortunately, that has not been the case and we are now in a situation whereby some workers have been left without payments for three months. That is a long time for someone to be waiting for a vital payment, and especially over Christmas when household costs are so high. I accept, however, that it takes time to frame legislation and there is a pipeline of legislation. This legislation would have been put on that conveyor belt of Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Staff at the Celbridge Manor Hotel in my constituency received their redundancy notices last November, with the promise that they would receive payments before Christmas. Their state of limbo continues today, and no statutory payments have issued. Indeed, the hotel’s owner has dangled the idea of an extra 10% gratuity being added to their statutory entitlements in exchange for the workers' being legally bound to a gagging clause concerning the matter. This was reported by<i> The Business Post</i> on several occasion. I find this situation unacceptable. I have continually contacted the various Departments involved to try to get some finality in this case. This legislation is therefore extremely welcome, and it must be passed urgently. I wish, though, that there had been some foresight in the context of having this Bill ready for consideration as soon as the suspension of redundancies was lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> As I said, however, we are happy to support the Bill. It is welcome. If there is a criticism to be made, it is that if it could have been done sooner, then that would have made a significant difference to people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_626">I will be sharing time with Deputy Boyd Barrett and, possibly, Deputy Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I will start by making some suggestions as to how the small but positive reforms contained in this Bill could be improved before moving on to the wider issue of workers' rights. The Bill states that periods of time up to September 2021 during which workers were laid off because of Covid emergency measures will be included in their reckonable periods of service for the purpose of statutory redundancy payments. However, anyone laid off because of Covid since the end of September 2021 will not have those lay-off periods counted. This would penalise night club and pub workers who were laid off because of Government-mandated closures or restricted opening hours between October 2021 and January 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The Government may argue in response that normal redundancy rights were restored at the end of September, meaning that employees facing lay-offs after that date could have claimed redundancy as normal whereas previously those rights were suspended, but this effectively means forcing anyone who was laid off because of Covid since September to choose between triggering redundancy and giving up on getting his or her job back on the one hand and, on the other, being laid off for a period of time that will not be included in his or her reckonable service for redundancy purposes. That is unfair and must be changed, and we will seek to amend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> It is an issue that the Bill only applies to statutory redundancy, where workers who have negotiated better redundancy terms with their employers will not automatically be entitled to have lay-off periods included in their periods of reckonable service and will have to struggle individually or collectively as groups of workers with a private employer to win it.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I also raise a question relating to profitable companies that may be winding up or making a number of workers redundant for non-financial reasons not having to cover these costs themselves rather than it falling to the State to do so. There is already evidence of profitable companies super-exploiting pandemic-related corporate welfare, for example, companies paying dividends while receiving the employment wage subsidy. The absence of any attempt to deter this and the light touch approach taken in general to policing the billions of euro in corporate welfare that were handed out during the pandemic stands in stark contrast with the punitive approach taken towards those on the PUP. The PUP was the first Covid support to be cut long before anything for businesses. It is not so long ago that workers were claiming they faced having their payments stopped if they were intercepted by social welfare inspectors at the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I wish to make an additional point about the relatively small payout compared to the cost of living and the scale of the oncoming redundancies. The Bill entitles covered workers to a maximum additional payout of €1,860. This is approximately the equivalent of one month's rent in Dublin and much less than the anticipated rise in the cost of basic necessities over the next year. While it is welcome, it is not going to go far. It is a drop in the ocean considering the tidal wave of involuntary redundancies coming our way once Covid payments to businesses are withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The EWSS is to end for many businesses from 30 April and for businesses affected by the last round of Covid restrictions - mainly in hospitality, the arts and entertainment - from 30 May. It is only then that we will begin to have a clearer picture of the longer term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employment. At the committee yesterday, the Tánaiste trumpeted last December's 7.5% unemployment rate, but that may prove premature. The latest figures show 75,000 people still on the PUP and a further 279,000 on the EWSS, yet the Tánaiste has previously estimated a maximum of 56,000 redundancies over the next three years. The €150 million budget for the expansion of State payments under the Bill suggests that a higher number - perhaps in the region of 80,000 - is anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> However many workers end up losing their jobs, it must be a core priority that not one worker loses out on any of his or her redundancy entitlements, be that from the State or his or her employer. Unfortunately, the Government has not taken this obvious opportunity while it is reforming redundancy law anyway to give workers what they really need and deserve, namely, the right to receive every cent of what they are rightfully owed by employers, including additional redundancy payments, and to be first in line when companies are liquidated.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> This was a core demand of the Debenhams workers. They stood on picket lines in all weathers for 406 days during a global pandemic. These heroic and mainly female workers were betrayed time and again, not only by their employer, but the Government, which stood behind them with crocodile tears. Unfortunately, they were also failed by aspects of the trade union leadership. As with the Clerys workers before them, the Government sat on its hands, pretending it was useless for anything stronger than tea and sympathy or a few claps for front-line workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> What would a left government that actually cared about workers' rights do in this situation? It would immediately legislate to protect workers in collective redundancy situations by putting them at the top of the queue. That could be done by amending the Companies Act 2014 to provide for preferential creditor status to employees in collective redundancies and to include all payments due to workers in the list of payments covered. That is what we proposed in our Private Members' Bill last May. Fearing a public outcry at a time when public support for the Debenhams workers was widespread, the Government took the cynical decision not to oppose openly our Companies (Protection of Employees' Rights in Liquidations) Bill 2021, otherwise known as the Debenhams Bill. Of course, the Government has failed to do anything since to progress our Bill or to improve workers' rights in collective redundancy situations materially. It has a golden opportunity to that now when it is amending the law on redundancies for other reasons, but it has chosen not to. We will be submitting amendments in line with the Debenhams Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> The second and even more important thing that a left government with an eco-socialist programme would do would be to carry out a radical overhaul of workers' rights in this country. The Industrial Relations Act 1990 must be repealed and replaced with a charter of workers' rights. It would include the right to establish pickets and workplace occupations, the right to engage in political and sympathy strikes, and the right to mandatory trade union recognition, as proposed in People Before Profit's Trade Union Recognition Bill 2021. Without these rights, the workers' movement is fighting with one hand tied behind its back, which is, of course, the whole point of the 1990 Act. In most other European countries, workers are not legally prohibited from striking in support of another group of workers. In Ireland, though, the Government has banned both political and sympathy strikes. This is despite our proud history of the world famous Dunnes anti-apartheid strike. Nearly 40 years on, parties on all sides of this House would profess to believe that the strikers were on the side of right, yet such a strike could not legally take place today against, for example, Israel despite its recently being declared an apartheid state by human rights organisations from Amnesty International to Human Rights Watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> The right to mandatory trade union recognition, as proposed in People Before Profit's Trade Union Recognition Bill 2021 and commonplace in most other European countries, is also a fundamental workers' right. Without it, many workers' rights on paper are rendered essentially meaningless. In this situation, it is hardly surprising that union membership fell from 33% in 2005 to 24% in 2018. Collective bargaining coverage is approximately 33%, the seventh lowest of 22 EU countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> We need to tackle the significant increase in precarious work, gig work and bogus self-employment. The Government has sat on its hands while precarious employment among young people has reached unprecedented levels. Research by the National Youth Council of Ireland found that 38% of people aged between 18 and 29 years were on temporary contracts. A "staggering 82 per cent" said precarious work was the only work available. Over 70% said that their current temporary or part-time contracts were causing them serious hardship. Part-time and temporary workers are also more likely to be low paid. Half of precarious workers under 30 years of age earn less than the living wage. On top of this, workers under 20 years of age are discriminated against by only being legally entitled to lower minimum wage rates. This Dáil term, I will be introducing the national minimum wage (equal pay for young workers) Bill, which will abolish discriminatory lower minimum wage rates for young workers, including apprentices.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> To fight for workers' rights, higher pay in a time of soaring inflation and decent redundancies, we need to build an active rank and file base in the trade unions and reinvigorate them as democratic, fighting organisations, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">It is only through an active, rank and file, fighting trade union movement that we can restore public sector pay, reverse cuts and fight for equal and better pay and conditions and decent redundancy pay for all workers, regardless of gender, race, disability or immigration status.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_641">Without a shadow of a doubt, the most high-profile redundancy that took place during the Covid-19 period, to which this Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is a response, was the Debenhams redundancy. Why does this Bill not involve trying to do something to compensate the Debenhams workers for the failure and inadequacy of legislation to protect against the sort of strategic liquidation that Debenhams engaged in with devastating consequences for the Debenhams workers?</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I met with the Debenhams workers yesterday and it was interesting just to refresh my own memory of the circumstances. Where is the Government's response to what happened to them? Where is the change in the law on redundancy to prevent that kind of strategic liquidation where workers are denied the redundancy entitlements they should get? Of course, the Minister of State will know and recall that the workers had an agreement that they would receive two weeks' statutory pay plus two weeks' salary for each year of service. They did not get that. They fought an incredible battle for more than a year on the picket lines. As they reminded me yesterday, some of the women had never been on a picket line in their lives. For more than a year, from early morning until late at night, sometimes literally around the clock, in a loading bay at the back of the Ilac Centre in the case of the Henry Street branch and at Debenhams stores across the country, more than 1,000 women were forced to engage in that action because of the law. I have some questions in that regard, as do the workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> As I and the workers understand it, when someone is made redundant there is supposed to be a staged process of notice, which I think runs for a period of between 30 and 90 days, depending on the particular situation. None of this happened in the case of Debenhams. In early April 2020, the workers received an email from the CEO of Debenhams in which he informed them that they should ignore media speculation about possible redundancies, they should not worry, there was no problem and their jobs were safe. One week later, the same CEO sent an email telling the workers their jobs were gone. They never heard from the company again.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The workers have a question. It is not an allegation; they want clarification on the facts. As they understand it, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to be notified about such large collective redundancies. I know the Minister of State may not be able to answer the question now, but the workers would like an answer as to when, during that period, the Department was first notified of the redundancies and what the response of the Government was. They would very much appreciate a response to that question and I think they are owed it. Furthermore, how was it that Debenhams could do that when there was a statutory process around it, which seemed to be utterly disregarded?</p>

          <p eId="para_646">I am because it is a redundancy payments Bill. It relates to Covid redundancies. The Debenhams redundancy was a Covid redundancy, where people lost their jobs in the middle of the emergency. The workers lost everything. They did not get any of their entitlements. I am asking whether this Bill addresses that. That is the question. Does the Bill address it? If not, why not? I think the Minister of State needs to understand what happened and needs to tell us what he knows because we cannot prevent this from happening again unless we get answers these questions. That must be done so that there is a legislative response and we have an opportunity to table amendments on the next Stage that could address the deficiencies - if there are such, and it would seem to me that there are - in respect of what happened in the Debenhams case.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The other question is how, in this circumstance, could a company that goes into liquidation then move €50 million out of the Debenhams online business, <i>Debenhams.ie</i>, which is clearly part of the Debenhams consortium and which is directly linked to the stores and so on? What is it about the law that would allow that to happen? How can that happen? What are we going to do to stop it happening, so that the just redundancy entitlement that the workers should have is not stolen from them, through what are essentially accountancy tricks, by the company moving assets that should be available for the redundancy payment?</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> What are we going to do about the fact the Debenhams consortium was able to load the Irish company with a whole series of debts that it did not have and which properly belonged to the British company? It loaded those debts on to further remove, as it were, assets that might have been available to pay the redundancy for the workers. These sorts of loopholes can be exploited and there is a sharp practice that follows from it from companies in order to avoid paying workers their just entitlement. It should be noted that all that value that <i>Debenhams.ie</i> built up and all those assets were essentially assets that were created through the labour, hard work and decency of good workers who were loved by the customers of Debenhams. All of that goodwill that Debenhams had, and which gave it its value, was robbed from the workers through accountancy tricks. What are we doing to prevent that happening so that workers get their just redundancy and the State and the taxpayer are not on the hook for the sharp practice of companies engaging in what clearly looks like and is, in my view and that of the workers, a strategic liquidation?</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The workers have issued an invitation to the Minister of State. They are making a documentary about this historic struggle of women workers, which has inspired workers the length and breadth of the country in their determination to fight the injustice they face. They are asking that the Minister of State participate in the documentary they are making. Perhaps he will consider that. The workers will probably send him a written invitation to participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Everybody at the time, including the Government and the Opposition, accepted that a great wrong had been done. The case that was always made by the Government was that its hands were tied because the law is the law. What are we going to do to ensure this never happens again and that workers robbed of their redundancy entitlements will have them guaranteed? What we are going to do to ensure we have the laws in place to prevent the absolutely appalling and disgusting behaviour that Debenhams engaged in from ever happening again? I am keen to hear the Minister of State's response to those points, as are, more importantly, the Debenhams workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">The Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is welcome. It is a short Bill. We support it and we support what it sets out to do. However, there are other issues in this area that also need to be examined. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that many workers face redundancy and a very uncertain future.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">It is a difficulty that arose in this particular situation. Section 12A of the Redundancy Payments Act was suspended during the Covid-19 crisis. As a result employees were protected from being made redundant. It also had that knock-on effect at the time they were either off work or whatever that a significant number were concerned that they had lost up to a year of reckonable service in the calculation of any future redundancy payment due to the time they spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. </p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The time spent by workers laid off or on short time, such as in receipt of that payment, is calculable as reckonable service in the calculation of redundancy entitlements. That is what this Bill is attempting to do. It is welcome and it is what we want to see happen as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> The experience of so many workers, and our colleague referred a few moments ago to the Debenhams workers as an example, is that it is a crisis in their lives. This week we have an issue in County Sligo in Collooney where B. Braun Hospicare Ireland, a company which produces dressings, has decided that it is going to cease production and will be closing down over a period of 18 months. There are 89 workers there, 80 of whom are going to be made redundant. While their company is assuring them that it will be 18 months away, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the Debenhams workers were told initially that their future was secure and that there was restructuring and not to worry. Very quickly, things change. Things can change for workers and the great fear is that workers are not sufficiently protected in those circumstances. Everything that needs to be done should be done. While this Bill is very specific in what it is doing, and I appreciate and understand that, there needs to be much more done to ensure large companies of this nature, in particular, deal fairly with their workforce who have been loyal to them for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> In respect of this company in Sligo, it began in 1984. Decades of service have been given to the local community and economy which has built that company up to being very profitable over that time. Many of the workers feel that they are being cast aside at this stage. It is most unfortunate. </p>
          <p eId="para_656"> This legislation is looking at a very small piece of this issue but there is so much more that needs to be done in that entire area to ensure that workers' rights are upheld.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. While this Bill is welcome, it comes very late for many workers who have worked hard in the workplace, and have been let very badly down. The Bill is technical in nature and comprises four sections. The purpose of the legislation is to provide for the making of a once-off State-funded payment to workers facing redundancy who have lost the opportunity to procure reckonable service due to layoffs caused by the Covid-19 restrictions. The proposed legislative change is intended to ensure that such workers will receive full redundancy entitlements, as though they had not been laid off during the emergency period of 13 March 2022 to 30 September 2021 and to ensure that employers are not burdened with that cost to enhance their recovery viability. Government-mandated restrictions have caused workers to lose the opportunity to procure reckonable service through no fault of their own or their employers. For this reason, a reckonable service Covid-19-related payment is to be funded by the State based on the duration of the Covid-19 restrictions. The maximum State payment to which a person made redundant will be entitled to is €1,860 tax-free if they were laid off for the entire period of the restrictions and were earning €600 or more per week. Payments for periods of layoffs arising from Covid-19 restrictions will be made by the Department of Social Protection out of the Social Insurance Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> It is envisaged that payments through the scheme will be operational for a period of three years until 1 October 2024. People who have already been made redundant since March 2020 and who have been laid off due to Covid-19 will be covered under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> When we are talking about workers' rights, I have many constituents who have so many issues in respect of pensions and miscommunications between the various Departments. I have one lady who can prove she has made 520 contributions and yet she cannot receive her pension. Mind you, she received it initially but it was then taken from her.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> I know of another very ill man who was self-employed for years. When he applied for illness benefit he was turned down. He then applied for invalidity benefit and he was again turned down. The problem was that he did not have enough contributions from the previous years and the reason for this was that he was too ill to work or claim any welfare payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> This system is not good enough and measures need to be put in place for exceptional cases and to allow deciding officers to use a little bit of discretion for extreme cases. Let us face it, a little bit of cop on should be used for people in extreme circumstances and for people who have worked extremely hard all their lives and deserve a break. There is nothing more upsetting than having to tell somebody who is very ill and has a large number of bills and overheads and a family that they are entitled to nothing. It is terrible to have to say that to them. Their social welfare office will try every measure from every angle, even contacting the Minister, although not personally but her Department, to see if there is any possibility a payment can be made to a person who is very ill and is a deserving case. Proof from accountants, doctors and medical people are provided but this still does not work as it falls between two stools, which is a terribly unfair situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> This Bill probably comes too late for Debenhams workers. Much has been said about them today, with, in fairness, well-voiced concerns expressed about the way these workers were treated, which was appallingly. I know some of these workers who are from my end of west Cork and I was in contact with them during their crisis. To be honest with the Minister of State, there was little compassion shown in here for the Debenhams workers. Some of these workers had worked all their lives and knew nothing about protesting. They only joined the protest because they were in extreme circumstances and were left there by the State. The State sometimes needs to stand up with a strong voice coming from its leadership. That might send a message. Perhaps Debenhams is above listening to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> We have the same situation in west Cork with Cara Lodge residential treatment centre where 27 employees working in west Cork’s only addiction treatment centre for teenage boys was closed in September 2020 due the Covid-19. Given that this was the only addiction centre, one must ask whether addiction ended and whether people need that service anymore. Of course, they need that service. There were teams of professionals there who worked with the teenagers. There were administrative staff, cooks, cleaners and maintenance crews. The redundancy situation which arose from that was a nightmare for these workers. They lost their jobs and they could not understand why. A great deal of shenanigans were going on behind the scenes and nobody had the decency to put their hand up and give the full reasons the centre was closing. Mind you, I hear it has reopened recently under another heading but it is the people who spent years working with these young people there that we must consider. I spoke to many young people who had come out the other side. The users of the service were so hurt to think that others who could be in the same circumstances could end up not getting that service and that the employees had lost their jobs after spending many years working there. On top of losing their jobs then, redundancy became a nightmare for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Unfortunately, no constituency escapes redundancy and it reaches every one of them. It certainly leaves a sting in the tail, however, for many people if back-ups or supports for workers are not there. To lose one’s job is a daunting experience for many when the right supports are not there and it leaves people feeling extremely vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I plead with the Minister of State to address the issues I have mentioned, namely, extreme illnesses and pain. He may not be the Minister of State in charge of that area but he might sit down with his colleagues and look at a situation where a payment can be made to people in those circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">This amending Bill will recognise that no newly-redundant workers will have lost out on their reckonable service while they were temporarily laid off due to Covid-19 regulations. It also highlights these employees were not necessarily laid off and that they had not qualified for a State payment - the PUP or the jobseeker's allowance. The objective of this amending Bill is to address that gap. It allows the person to qualify for a Social Insurance Fund payment of €1,860. Employers are not liable for this shortfall in the period from March 2020. I understand the significance of the gap highlighted in this amending Bill and what this entails.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The Debenhams workers in Limerick and the way they were treated by an international company that moved its assets out of the country to another international company has already been mentioned in the Chamber. The company did that to get away from what it should have given the Irish Debenhams workers for the loyal service given to my county of Limerick and families and people who live there. They worked hard looking after the shop and the people of Limerick and the surrounding areas. Debenhams used a different international company to transfer the assets before the Government could do anything and that cannot happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> With rising fuel costs and costs of living in general in this country, how many more companies will fall short? How many of those will be small and medium enterprises, SMEs? We might see the same position with redundancies and although international companies might have many millions of euro, 51% of workers are employed by SMEs. There is currently a high cost of living and cost of running a business; there are high insurance costs across the board. These SMEs are being crippled as a result. International companies and those operating across the water can get stuff into this country much cheaper and they can be resupplied at a much cheaper rate than our SMEs. What happens to the people who will be forced into closure due to rising costs, which the Government could help with? I have already highlighted how this could happen with fuel costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> There are also people in this country who through no fault of their own cannot work. I know one person who because of a late diagnosis of mental illness could not turn up to work. He did not qualify for a jobseeker's payment or any medical support. He cannot now get any funding while his wife and two children are trying to fight fires that are dropping all around him. They are trying to quench those fires so the family can survive but there is no recognition that the person has not worked at times over the past two years because of mental illness. They now know what was wrong but the family qualifies for nothing because it was not recognised when he was working. The period in question is two years and exceptional cases must be allowed for people to qualify in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I have been self-employed for more than 30 years. I look at my local publicans, shopkeepers and people in small industry around me who are like me. The legislation and criteria being put in place by us aimed at multinational companies will cripple our own economy, particularly the people who keep our children in summer jobs during college, for example. These people are trying to feed their families but we are crippling them with enforcement of regulations in this country. I need the Minister of State to help me get the Departments to understand what it is like to be somebody in an SME. Last night I spoke to such matters and I was corrected on one of my comments. I accept that. Nevertheless, I spoke as somebody in the Rural Independent Group, where most of us are self-employed. We bring to this Chamber real-life experience of people running a business outside this Chamber. We can see first-hand how other businesses struggle with insurance and the day-to-day running of their business while trying to keep the doors open. They are trying to compete with multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I have an example. In a city there are massive supermarkets but in my parish, which includes Granagh, Ballingarry and Croom, we have good sized shops but there is a smaller population. As a result the figures for food costs are slightly higher than what may be the case in the cities. What is in place to help SMEs outside a large populated area, as the costs for running the business are the same? If a business operates in a small parish, such as Granagh, and it is ratable, it provides for the community around it, including items such as fuel. That may be gas, coal, briquettes or whatever people want, but it needs them in large quantities so they can be some way affordable for those people. The business must stock all these different products to cover the area, which might have 400 or 500 people within a radius of five, six or seven miles. The rates paid in the county are the same as those paid in the city, despite such businesses not having a fraction of the footfall. These businesses are working for the community, however, and I can get my loaf of bread or milk without having to travel 20 miles or 30 miles to the nearest supermarket.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> They are also a point where people can meet their neighbours; the hub of a parish. Years ago we had a pub in every parish but in some parishes we are lucky if there is a shop. There should be a hall, a church and facilities for GAA and soccer but the shop or SME is the hub. In our areas, they are so important to the communities. They are also important as they provide employment and a service to older people in our communities, including getting basic food items for the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I want us to consider what we can put in place for SMEs in this country that are providing a service for the rural people of Ireland in the likes of my county. What can we do to advise the Government and show what such companies can do on the ground? I mentioned Ballingarry, which has a supermarket used by people all around it. Again, that business does not have the same footfall as a business in the city. A shop in a city might have three or four different items and the neighbouring shop might have three or four different items and they can survive because of footfall. In the countryside, a shop must have everything people want in one shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> A business is rateable on the size of a property and if there is a bathroom on the premises. That is a facility for somebody who may be passing through on their way to Kerry or Cork but it means the business is rateable if that person wants to go to the bathroom. All these elements must be examined and we must consider how we can keep our communities together and help them grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I support the legislation but it must go much further. I need the Minister of State's help within the Government to get people to understand rural living and the work of SMEs. It is not all about international companies. We can see what an international company did to the people of Limerick with the example of Debenhams. The action was too little, too late in that respect. I appreciate any help the Minister of State can give me in helping to protect SMEs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_677">In fairness, we support this legislation, which is clearly necessary. It addresses a shortfall that Deputy Louise O'Reilly would have pointed out at a very early stage. There is support for this right across the House because it does not make sense that there should be a scenario where workers would lose out on reckonable time relating to redundancy on the basis of being on the pandemic unemployment payment for a time. All the supports provided by the State to workers and businesses were about ensuring we could keep the show on the road for society and businesses. It was about ensuring workers and their families would be okay during the pandemic and everyone would be able to do the right thing during the period of restrictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This is literally us following up on one of those gaps that have appeared between stools. It is necessary work that needs to happen. Obviously, there will be a Covid-19 payment from the Social Insurance Fund just to ensure there is no shortfall. We all accept that. We all accept that there are significant shortfalls across the board in the context of redundancy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Recently, 100 workers have been made redundant from National Pen in Dundalk. There have also been redundancies at Hilton Food in Drogheda. I am going to speak about National Pen because the Tánaiste has stated that a generous package will be given to workers. I have spoken to some of the workers at this company. Negotiations, or at least meetings on negotiations, have started, but no timeline in respect of the redundancies has been provided. We know it is approximately a year, but we do not know exactly what the timeline is for specific workers. We are not entirely sure what package is being proposed. The Tánaiste stated that he is not sure about it. I know there cannot be direct engagement but there has not been a good history in the context of National Pen. Its communications with its workers were absolutely dreadful. This is something we will all have to keep an eye on. Beyond that, once again we are talking about a non-unionised workforce. We really have to get to grips with the right to collective bargaining because, otherwise, we will have more of these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> If I had more time, I would address the need to consider the issues relating to insurance. I have spoken before on that matter. There is also the issue of the regional skills forum. We have a wider piece of work to do in respect of lifelong learning, retraining and such.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasGould" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_681">Last May, the Debenhams workers bravely ended their 406-day dispute when they accepted the Government's offer of a €3 million training fund. They were only on the picket line because this Government and previous Governments failed to implement the Duffy-Cahill report, yet here we are, 258 days later, and the Debenhams workers are still waiting for that training fund. This cannot be yet another promise broken by Fine Gael, which has never managed to put workers first. There is a need to work with the workers, iron out the details and ensure this fund is delivered. The Debenhams workers stood on the picket line through freezing winters and through scandalous treatment by Debenhams, KPMG and this Government that did not care about them. Government Deputies and councillors stood on the picket lines and made promises to these people but those promises were never delivered on. There were no champagne parties for the workers, no trips to Dubai for wellness and no €81,000 pay increases. These workers were left without redundancy by a company that was very profitable and hived money away to England and other places. Instead, the Government has not even delivered the training fund it promised. It is shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> What is even more shameful is that these workers were only in this dispute because the Government never implemented the Duffy-Cahill report. I refer to redundancy loopholes. We have seen it with the Clerys workers, the Coca Cola workers in Cork, the Vita Cortex workers in Cork and the Debenhams workers. These situations have been occurring since the report that would finally see workers put first was published, but the Government has still not delivered on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Why is it that when workers, the backbone of the economy, come looking for the most basic level of respect and protections, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party look the other way? This legislation is welcome but it does not go far enough. It does not go where we need it to go. When the pals of the Government are looking for pay increases, ambassador roles or confidential documents, the Government delivers, but it has not delivered for workers and that is why the Bill needs to go a lot further.</p>

          <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_690">I thank the Members from various parties for their contributions and the issues they raised. This is a short Bill that tries to focus on one category of people who are missing out due to lay-offs during the Covid restrictions and the reckonable service on which they have missed out. I have discussed the matter in the House with various Deputies during the past two years. We said we would have a response ready to deal with this and that is what the legislation before the House is doing. I am conscious that it has given rise to much discussion on other issues. I will try to deal with that briefly in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I get the impression that Deputy Gould has been working on his speech for the past two years, trying to cover bits and pieces. I wish to be clear. I have repeatedly stated in the House, whether here in Leinster House or down in the convention centre, and at committee meetings that it is not true to say that if the recommendations of the Duffy-Cahill report had been implemented, what happened to the Debenhams workers could have been prevented. The latter is not true and we have to face up to that. The authors of the report stated that at the committee. I met the Debenhams workers and their union representatives at a very early stage, along with the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and others, on a few occasions. We gave two commitments and they had two asks for their campaign. The first was that they wanted to see their collective agreement honoured by the company. The agreement went beyond the statutory payments. The State can only guarantee statutory payments. That is what we do. I am happy to have a debate on whether those statutory payments should be increased. That is something we could do. They have been there since 2002. I am open to that. However, the State and the Social Insurance Fund that everybody pays into can only honour statutory payments. They cannot go beyond that and honour agreements that are reached individually between companies and employees. That is above what the State can guarantee because such agreements could be different in every situation. Deputies have to be honest and fair about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> I have said it before and I will say it again that the Debenhams workers were wronged by that company. They missed out on their collective agreement. They were also wronged by others and were given misinformation and false hope. I never try to do that and never would do that, but I did commit to work with them where we felt we could strengthen the legislation. That was a commitment we gave. We worked with the unions to try to help them get their entitlements and packages. The State did get involved in respect of a certain package relating to training and supports and so on. I believe that is there and should be there and tapped into. I am happy to work with others on that. The last time I checked, everybody who applied for a statutory payment had received one. The State does protect workers in redundancy situations and it stands behind those statutory repayments. It is wrong to keep alluding to other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised issues that I am happy to tease through with him again. I will meet the workers if that is what they want. That is fine. However, he and other Deputies have repeated this link to assets and money. The courts do not agree with them on that. I have asked on many occasions for Deputies who stand up in the House and make such claims with authority to show us the evidence. No one has come to me with anything. Deputies make statements in the House that they claim are factually correct. The courts judge these matters and those judgments are not in agreement with the Deputies in question, or have not been as yet. The receiver has a job to do. If assets were moved, the law does provide protections in that regard. However, that is not what has come through in the courts and no Member of this House has provided me with any proof in that regard. I want to put that out there. We would act on such evidence. The law is there to act on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> Some Deputies constantly link this back to the Duffy-Cahill report or the Clerys workers. Those are different situations and nobody has given me evidence to show any different. I would certainly work on that if I had it. I did commit to the workers that if we could, we would strengthen the legislation in respect of workers' rights in redundancy situations. The Tánaiste also gave that commitment. We are prepared to do that. We announced an update in that regard which I will also provide to the House. Following the engagement with the Debenhams workers, I said I would use my time in this Department, along with the Tánaiste, to strengthen the legislation to make it better for workers in the future if we can do so and if the need is proven. That does not mean that we said the recommendations in the Duffy-Cahill report are the answer to that issue. That has been well teased out at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> Following extensive engagement with the social partners in the context of the debate arising from the treatment of the Debenhams workers and other situations since then, the plan for action in respect of collective redundancies following insolvency was published in June 2021. It sets out several commitments to safeguard further the rights of workers in these circumstances, including a range of amendments to company law and employment law, setting up an employment law review group on a statutory basis and the provision of an accessible guidance document to help workers and their representatives to navigate the existing legal framework. Again, there was a significant amount of misinformation. Workers were given misinformation at a very early stage in the context of Debenhams. That guidance document is very important in the context of people's rights, but also to make sure that people can pursue their rights. We will help them with that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The guidance was published on the Department's website in December 2021. The document aims to ensure that employees are aware of the protections that exist for employees whose employment is ending in redundancy. The most relevant pieces of information have been brought together to ensure that employees are fully informed of their rights and can act accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Other recommendations, such as the rescue process for small and micro companies, were progressed in the Companies Acts. The remaining company law recommendations will be progressed this year. Work on drafting amendments to the Protection of Employment Act 1977 will commence in quarter 1 of 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The independent employment law review group that we agreed to establish will be established this year. It will comprise expert stakeholders and will help to shape the formulation of policy and legislation to ensure that Ireland's employment law framework remains fit for purpose and adapts to the evolving contemporary workplace. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> This complementary range of measures will promote the provision of quality information, enhanced participation and transparency for those workers facing collective redundancy following a company law insolvency. It will also provide for the continued development of company law in general, which is what I committed to when I met the Debenhams workers. That was one part of their campaign, and another was the achievement of the terms of their collective agreement. That was a matter to do with the company; the State could not get involved because the State can only honour statutory payments from the Social Insurance Fund in order to be fair to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I have no issue with having a debate on whether the statutory entitlement should be increased. The figure was set in 2002, and I am happy to have that debate. It is a separate discussion that we all have to feed into. Whatever is agreed has to be level and fair for every employee. It does not mean that collective agreements that are independent are included. They are separate, and we have to recognise that. We discussed options for companies to set money aside to honour personal agreements. That is something I am all for, but it is beyond the involvement of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I thank colleagues, most of whom agree with the Bill, and rightly so because it will make sure that employees do not miss out. Some people asked why employers should not pay for this. That would not be right, because this is about enforced restrictions on employers and employees. It is important that we step in quite quickly to put the legislation in place to make sure that nobody misses out due to retirement or reckonable service.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> On why the Bill was not ready in the autumn, we clearly said we would make these payments. We committed to that and it went through Cabinet in time, before section 12 was related. There are complications in developing a system to make these payments possible. That was always going to take a period of time. While it is to be hoped the legislation will be ready first, work has started and has continued over the past number of months regarding the systems needed to make these payments. Deputy O'Reilly asked about that. That work is nearing completion and will be finished before the end of quarter 1. We will be in a position for the Department of Social Protection to make these payments from quarter 2 onwards. The payments are guaranteed. People know they will get them. They will be paid to the maximum of people's entitlements. People who were fully laid off right throughout will receive a little over €1,800. For many others, the figure will be lower. It will be 20 September 2024 before we can judge the full impact of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> While the figures show the cost could potentially be €150 million, we are setting aside €10 million now and we believe it will be a lot less than €150 million. Thankfully, due to other supports for businesses, employers and jobs, which everybody here agreed with, we are in a position whereby we are having a stronger recovery coming out of Covid than people could have predicted. It is to be hoped that will reduce the number of redundancies due to Covid and, therefore, the draw on this fund. The timeline will mean payments can be made in quarter 2</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> The matters raised by Deputy Michael Collins were not related to this Bill, but I am happy to have them checked out. I have covered most of the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett. Deputy O'Donoghue raised some issues, and I want to assure him that even though I am a Government Deputy, I still meet people who work in businesses and are out there on a daily basis. As Deputies and Ministers, we meet the same people with the same issues and queries, and we are all equally committed to working through them, whether we are in opposition or in government. On the image that people try to portray that Government Deputies never get to talk to real people, people need to look at themselves in the mirror. That is part of our everyday job. That is why we committed to this Bill a long time ago. We recognised that businesses and employees would need something like this. We meet people every day of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Regarding SME supports, we have shown that response over the past two years. There was cross-party support for the measures for the SME community because we recognised that SMEs are massive employers in the State and create jobs throughout the country. When we support SMEs, we support jobs. We want to have a jobs-led recovery so that we can put in place the resources we need to provide all of the other services across education, health and so on. </p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I again thank Deputies for their support for the Bill. I have dealt with most of the issues raised. If I missed any, I am happy to correspond with Deputies individually.</p>

        <speech by="#OssianSmyth" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Climate_and_Communications" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_709">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_710">"That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Having regard to the unprecedented rise in electricity prices, I am pleased to have the opportunity to commend the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022 to the House. I will open the debate by setting the context for the actions to be taken on foot of this Bill. Although many Members will be familiar with these issues, it is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation we will find ourselves in with regard to energy costs and wider pressures on the cost of living. I will also describe the sections of the Bill in detail and, with regard to its main provisions, set out the background and why they are needed for the operation of the scheme. However, my overarching message today is that while the scheme which the Bill will establish is just one of a suite of measures, it is critical that it is put in place within this quarter. I seek Members' support to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> First, I will outline the main factors affecting electricity prices in Ireland. Second, I will provide an overview of the domestic and international response to rising electricity and gas prices. Third, I will reaffirm the Government's conviction that the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> On the factors affecting Irish electricity prices, Deputies will appreciate that we face additional costs due to our geographical location, fossil fuel dependency, the small scale of the Irish market, low population density and exchange rate fluctuations. However, the most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the upward trend in international gas prices, which has brought them to an unprecedented high. In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020, for a variety of international reasons. Current indications are that these higher prices will continue at a significantly higher level than in early 2020 for the foreseeable future. This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices, as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas due to the fact that gas is used for electricity generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> It is a matter of serious concern to the Government that recent electricity and gas price increases caused by these international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, particularly those in a more vulnerable economic position. It is important to recognise that these price increases are not caused by Government or regulatory decisions. This is because price regulation ended many years ago. Suppliers compete with each other on price and set their own prices accordingly, as one would expect in a competitive, commercial liberalised market. Consumers can shop around and switch easily. It is important to point out that all European markets are experiencing these price increases. While Ireland has its own specific circumstances, the rise in energy costs is not unique to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> I will now turn to the international and domestic response. In general, in terms of the overall cost of living it vital to stress that a co-ordinated, whole-of-government response is being followed. It is essential in tackling this issue. In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the EU, the European Commission published a communication in October 2021 entitled, "Tackling rising energy prices: A toolbox for action and support". The toolbox sets out the measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of the energy price rises, which, at the same time, do not cut across the EU energy legislative framework or the EU longer-term policy framework for the green transition. The Government made a number of interventions in budget 2022 in line with measures put forward in the European Commission's toolbox, such as implementing safeguards to avoid customer disconnections, providing supports for consumer empowerment and providing for a supplier of last resort in cases where suppliers exit the market in a disorderly manner. The electricity costs emergency benefit scheme to be established by this legislation is an additional measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> The Government's primary response to tackling the impact on households of increasing energy costs has been to use the tax and social welfare system to counter rising costs of living as set out in budget 2022. The fuel allowance is one of a range of income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection, which also includes general social welfare schemes, the living-alone payment increases to support those living alone and at a higher risk of poverty, and the household benefits package. Targeted supports are also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments, ENPs, and urgent needs payments, UNPs. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs, for example, in the case of ill health. This is in addition to increases in basic welfare and pension rates. Adjustments to income tax bands have also been introduced primarily as a response to the cost of living increases more generally, driven in part by higher energy prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Having regard to the urgent need to decarbonise, I will now outline the long-term approach for Ireland. In that context, the Government's energy efficiency and renewable energy measures are key. Government policy is driving investment in energy efficiency, investment in renewables, enhancing electricity interconnection and deepening the internal energy market. I will take energy efficiency as an example. Energy efficiency measures are not just essential to reduce emissions from our housing sector, they are also central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty and to improving health and social inclusion outcomes, while at the same time contributing to decarbonisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> The residential energy efficiency budget for my Department in 2022 is €202 million. Financed by carbon tax revenue, €109 million of this will fund Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, schemes to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or are at risk of, energy poverty. More than 4,500 homes will benefit from the upgrades that will be carried out under these SEAI schemes in 2022. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further €85 million as part of the local authority retrofit programme in 2022. This will deliver approximately 2,400 retrofits of local authority homes next year up to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 or cost optimal. Additionally, the review of the national development plan resulted in an unprecedented level of investment in retrofit. Some €5 billion of additional carbon tax revenues have been allocated to support residential retrofit to 2030. This means that the overall allocation for residential retrofit will be approximately €8 billion to 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Alleviating energy poverty is a key consideration in the new national retrofit plan, published as part of the climate action plan last year. More generally, the Climate Action Plan 2021 commits to improving how energy poverty schemes target those most in need. As is clear from the supports relating to energy efficiency and the specific measures introduced in budget 2022, the Government is committed to protecting the most vulnerable. As we transition away from fossil fuels and progressively decarbonise, we must ensure the way we decarbonise captures this unique opportunity to improve the quality of life for all. Making our homes energy efficient not only means they are warmer, healthier and cheaper to run, but also means we are taking concrete action on social deprivation that is sustainable and enduring.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> I will devote my remaining remarks to the subject matter of the Bill. Notwithstanding the other measures, the Government is determined to act quickly to help people further with these higher energy prices. The Bill provides for the establishment of a scheme for the purpose of making the electricity cost emergency benefit payment of €100 in 2022. The moneys for the scheme will be allocated by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communication, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. This amount will not exceed €215 million and will be for the purpose of making a once-off €100 payment by suppliers to each domestic electricity account held by them. This is on the basis of there being approximately 2.15 million domestic electricity account holders, as indicated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. The CRU will provide oversight of the scheme and it will be operated by the distribution system operator, ESB Networks, ESBN.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The mechanism by which the scheme will operate is as follows. I will provide under regulations for a date, to be known as the relevant date, on which the distribution system operator will calculate the total number of domestic electricity accounts in the State, on the basis of meter point registration numbers, MPRNs. The MPRN is the unique identifier for all accounts and as such must be used to ensure the €100 payment reaches each account. ESB Networks will notify me of this number, and this will allow the calculation of the necessary allocation of moneys for the scheme. On the effective date, which will also be set out by me in regulations, ESB Networks will notify each electricity supplier of the assigned MPRN for each domestic electricity account it supplies. ESB Networks will also, on the effective date, notify suppliers of the amount of money it will transfer to them for the purposes of the scheme. I will set out in regulations the period within which ESB Networks will transfer the funds to suppliers for the sole purpose of making payments under the scheme. Following receipt of these funds, suppliers will then, within the period to be prescribed by me under regulations, credit each domestic electricity account held with them on the effective date with a payment of €100. The CRU, as an independent regulator, will have oversight of the scheme. It will put in place administrative and operational arrangements to ensure that ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The CRU, on the basis of its existing powers to issue directions and secure compliance by licence holders with their obligations, will ensure that ESBN and suppliers perform their functions under the Bill. Suppliers and the ESBN are required to repay any moneys received by them which have not been used for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> I would now like to refer to some particular aspects of the scheme that will be of interest to Deputies more broadly. The scheme will apply to all domestic electricity account holders, including pay-as-you-go customers. With the support of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, my Department is working closely with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to ensure that those due the payment in rented accommodation receive it. I understand that there are approximately 300,000 tenancies registered with the RTB and that the majority of these tenants either hold their own electricity accounts or pay their landlord for their electricity on the basis of an actual bill and would therefore receive the benefit directly. My Department is working with the RTB on a public information campaign to ensure that any tenants, expected to be a small minority, for whom electricity costs are not separate from overall rental cost are aware of the scheme and entitlements. In that context, in the event that a dispute should arise between a tenant and landlord, there are existing dispute resolution mechanisms provided by the RTB. The scheme can only become operational following the passing of this underpinning legislation. As Deputies will appreciate, this emergency measures Bill aims to ensure that the credit can be made to domestic electricity account holders as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> The scheme will apply to every domestic electricity account holder using their unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills. This does mean that premises other than principal residences, such as holiday homes with a domestic electricity account, will be included in the scheme. The scheme uses this single-eligibility criterion to enable payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022. The scheme does not have additional eligibility criteria. For example, it is not means tested because the application of such criteria would override the automatic nature of the current scheme, require input from customers through formal applications and cross-checking by administrators, which would significantly delay the roll out of the payments. Therefore, the automatic crediting of all residential customer accounts is the most effective immediate term methodology.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> The CRU has advised that to implement the scheme in the timeframe required, suppliers will use existing billing systems to process the credit. The CRU has considered the question of an opt-out for people who do not wish to receive the payment. However, the scale of work required to the billing system would be of an order that would significantly delay the issuing of this payment to all electricity users. While I appreciate people's views on this, I also feel it is important to move ahead with administering the scheme so that people receive their payments as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill. There are ten sections. Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for definitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Section 2 provides for the establishment of the scheme, to be operated on a once-off basis. It also provides the basis for the estimation of the amount required, as well as for the allocation of the moneys for the scheme up to €215 million, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Section 3 provides the legislative basis for the transfer of the moneys, to be €100 for each domestic electricity account in the State, for the operation of the scheme by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to the distribution system operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Sections 4 and 5 provide for the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers, respectively, for the purposes of the operation of the scheme. Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act to create functions for the CRU, including for the purposes of oversight of the functions of the distribution system operator and suppliers, and to ensure that the administrative and operational arrangements necessary for the functioning of the scheme are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Section 7 deals with an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This amendment is to exempt the electricity costs emergency benefit payment from income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> Section 8 provides for the Minister to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to set out the dates and period for the operation of the scheme as well as to provide for additional functions of the distribution system operator, electricity suppliers, and such administrative and operational matters as may be required for the efficient operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Section 9 provides that the distribution system operator and electricity suppliers shall bear their own expenses. Section 10 contains standard provisions concerning the Short Title and commencement of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> I have outlined the main provisions of this emergency measures Bill and provided additional detail on the sections. I hope that this will be of assistance to Deputies. I look forward to an informed and meaningful debate and to working constructively with Deputies on all sides of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I will be taking eight minutes. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. People are facing real hardship in their day-to-day lives with inflation and runaway living costs The Government has sat on its hands and allowed the cost-of-living crisis to grow, and indeed it has contributed to it. Rents have been spiralling out of control for years and the Government has done nothing. The Government has failed to address high childcare costs for parents and inflation is outpacing wage growth to no end. Each year the Government hikes tax on energy and then wonders why people are struggling to heat their homes. These policy failures are now coming together into a crippling cost-of-living crisis. The Government is completely out of touch with reality and is either unwilling or unable to take the necessary action to tackle the costs that are having a detrimental impact on workers and families across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Of course the €100 electricity discount is welcome, but it will not make a dent in the financial challenge households are facing. It does not go far enough. Everyone knows that, including apparently the Government, if leaks from parliamentary party meetings in morning news reports are anything to go by. The Tánaiste acknowledged as much on Leaders' Questions earlier. Budget 2022 did not go far enough to protect people. The Government says it is making plans to do something about it. There has been talk from the Government to the effect of "If we knew then what we know now", but the truth is the Government did know then what it knows now because Sinn Féin and many others were shouting it from the rooftops. I raised it with the Minister of State three times in the previous term alone on Priority Questions, starting in July. Sinn Féin's alternative budget set out enhanced payments in social welfare, fuel allowance and a utility debt discretionary fund. The Government failed to heed any of it. The EU introduced its toolkit in October in recognition of the crisis and giving a green light to do something about it. Two months later, in the days before Christmas, the Government said it had a plan. Here we are on 3 February hoping that people might get grace to the value of €100 in a month or two. Families are in crisis and it is deepening one. When someone sounds the alarm in October you do not respond by saying I will see you in March or April. We know that inflation hits the poorest hardest and that the CSO's data are not reflective of this. We do not have accurate data on fuel poverty because this Government and that which preceded it failed to design measures for it. Anyone who bothers to listen knows that families have been put to the pin of their collars and beyond. They are in crisis and this Government knowingly delayed action. The €100 is welcome but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Much more needs to be done to help people. This Bill, if suitably amended, can act as a start, albeit a very late one.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> We in Sinn Féin are not happy with the current draft of the Bill and we have submitted numerous amendments for consideration on Committee Stage. In the first instance, we are concerned that this Bill is drafted in such a way as to permit only one payment. That does not reflect the crisis we are in. A once-off discount is short-sighted and it is clear that more needs to be done. There are no indications that the energy price hikes are going to stop any time soon. With political instability in Ukraine and Russia, international gas prices could increase further this year. Our amendments would give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more primary legislation down the line and ensuring that it could be done quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> We also want to see the Minister target these payments to households who need it most. The lack of targeting is a major weakness. This Bill is a very blunt instrument that will see millions of euro transferred to individuals who, relatively speaking, have no financial worries. It will see millionaires and others who do not need financial help get €100 from the taxpayer, while those who really need extra help will, in real and relative terms, still be below the water. We would like to see provision for those who want to forgo the payment have the option of surrendering their payment to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty. It is far from an ideal approach, but it is an attempt to make this legislation better, by trying to direct payments to those most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> We believe holiday homes should be excluded. We cannot have a situation where a person who is lucky enough to own two homes gets €200 while a family living on the breadline can only access half that amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I welcome some of the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, but we believe protection is needed for renters in this Bill. Some tenants' energy bills are managed by their landlord or a property management company. We do not want to see a situation where the credit is applied to bills but the savings are not passed on to the tenant. Sinn Féin has put forward an amendment seeking to ensure the €100 payment is passed on to renters and providing for a right to access a dispute mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> On a related point, I draw the Minister of State's attention to the issue of Travellers' access to the €100 credit. Will the Minister outline how this credit will apply to Travellers living on halting sites? The local authorities are the electricity account holder in many cases and families make payments to their local authorities. Perhaps the Minister of State will revert to me on that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> Sinn Féin calls on the Minister of State to engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the level of need for assistance with heating and electricity costs it is experiencing to ascertain the need for a discretionary fund to assist those in utility debt and target those who need additional support most. We called for such a discretionary fund in budget 2022 in addition to proposing to allocate €30 million to extend the fuel allowance eligibility. Like other positive proposals, however, it was not taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I look forward to the Committee Stage debate. I encourage the Minister of State and Department to take on board Opposition proposals. There is an opportunity to improve on the legislation. Sinn Féin will put forward constructive amendments, as will others in the Opposition. The Minister of State and Department should take them on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">The rising cost of energy and the overall costs of living are on the minds of everybody. When meeting residents and community groups, whether it is in Donnybrook, the inner city or Rathmines, we see that everybody is feeling the pressure as costs continue to rise. In the 12 months to December, inflation reached its highest level in 20 years. These high levels of inflation impact heavily on the daily lives of people in the State. We know who feels these sharp increases in inflation most. It is the working families who are hit hardest. These households must spend a higher proportion of their income on food and fuel. The cost of electricity has increased by 22%, the cost of gas is up 28% and home heating oil costs have risen by a staggering 53%. More families will be faced with the painful decision of having to choose between heating the house and feeding themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Measures must be taken by the Government to rein in inflation increases. While some factors may be outside of the Government's control, others certainly are not. The Government needs to step in to protect families from poverty. Provisions must be put in place to support low and middle income families. If the Government stands by, inflation and energy price spikes will push working families into poverty. We need to see meaningful actions, including the expansion of the fuel allowance scheme and the extension of the fuel allowance season by a further two weeks. The eligibility threshold for the allowance also needs to be increased by 10% to include approximately 30,000 additional homes. These are not radical measures but they will make a positive impact on many who are struggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Already, several EU member states such as France, Italy and Spain have taken decisive action to reduce the burden of these price hikes on ordinary people. In Spain, consumers will see their average monthly bill drop by 22%. The market has failed to provide lower and more competitive prices for consumers. The Government must intervene in a meaningful way to ease the burden on the public. We cannot allow its market-led approach to continue. The Government needs to seek a special derogation to remove VAT on household energy bills. Such a move would reduce household bills by 12%. This would greatly ease the burden on so many people and give workers and their families a much-needed break.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> In housing, the market-led approach backed by the policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil has also failed. This approach and these policies have caused the housing crisis to worsen by the month. The increases in the cost of living are a direct result of those two parties' policies. For many, the idea of owning a home seems impossible. This does devastating damage to communities, families and couples wanting to start a family. The rising cost of renting swallows a large chunk of most people's salaries and many feel suffocated by all of these rising costs. We need a ban on rent increases and rents need to be brought under control. Measures such as a refundable tax credit, equivalent to one month's rent and capped at €1,500, would be a good start. It would give renters a much-needed break. We need to see this Government standing up for ordinary working families, not standing idly by.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">We are all acutely aware of the issues arising from the increases in the cost of living and the impact these have had in recent months. We have had debate after debate on this issue in the Chamber in recent weeks. We need to see strong action to help those who are struggling most. We have all seen the impact of the increases in the costs of electricity and fuel in our electricity bills. I am sure many of us got our electricity bill through the door and were surprised at the significant rise in the bills. We also see it at the petrol pumps.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> The impact on lower income households has been catastrophic. It is a cause of concern and distress and there are things they must do without. These increases in prices mean they simply do not have additional spare cash lying around to help them to pay for this. All Members are seeing this in our clinics and when knocking on doors. I hold a weekly clinic and I knock on doors every week. The main issue that keeps coming up is that people are just not able to pay for things. One man told me this week that he had to sleep in the kitchen to keep warm. He cannot use the shower in the winter months because the bathroom is the coldest room in his house so he must use an alternative place for showering. That is a cold, hard fact. Many of us would find it unimaginable to have to go through that ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> This problem is not completely new. In November 2021, my colleague, Deputy Claire Kerrane, conducted a survey to which 14,000 people responded. Any Members who have conducted surveys will know that getting 14,000 respondents shows how live an issue this is. Of those who responded, 93% said they had seen a massive increase in energy prices. Of the 6,000 comments in the survey there are two statements I particularly want to read to the Minister of State. One person said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_751">As a pensioner, I can’t live on what’s left [each week]. I pay my electricity by card at An Post. I can’t afford groceries and eat the bare minimum. Life is very hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Another said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_753">Currently battling with high anxiety because I don’t know if I will be able to pay rent/electricity every month or pay for diesel. I’m a single mother of a 10 yr old boy … and on his Santa list he asked Santa to help his Mam be OK. Even my 10 yr old son can see I’m not OK any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">This is the reality. We need strong and urgent action from the Government. We need to see a ban on rent increases and one month's rent going back into the renters' pockets. We need to see the discretionary fund increased and more people being able to apply for the fuel allowance.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">My constituency has a varied demographic, particularly with regard to age. We have areas with a high percentage of elderly people and other areas that have a young population, with young families, single parents and so on. The constituency also has areas of economic disadvantage with high unemployment rates and families struggling to put food on the table for their children. There are also areas of the constituency that are more affluent. A number of voluntary groups in Dublin North-West work to alleviate the everyday stresses of struggling families by providing them with food parcels, clothes for their children and other essentials. Ocras Éire is one such group that does tremendous work, helping families and individuals who are homeless or struggling to provide the most basic needs for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> One of the most important things to provide for your family, apart from food, is a warm and comfortable home. For this to happen, it is essential for families and households to have access to an affordable supply of electricity or gas. Under normal circumstances, people in more vulnerable communities find it difficult to provide a consistent, economical or inexpensive form of energy, not just to heat their houses and apartments, but also to cook food and provide hot water for the household. It is now proving a real challenge for many families in my constituency to provide such a necessity and it greatly affects people's health and quality of life, especially the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> The avalanche of price increases for electricity and gas since last year is set to continue into 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">This is grim news for low-income families and the unemployed who have been finding it difficult, to say the least, to make ends meet. The high rate of inflation, currently at 5.4%, is a 20-year high. Families who are already paying exorbitant energy bills will continue to do so for the foreseeable future with ever-increasing electricity and gas bills. According to Money Guide Ireland, a customer of Electric Ireland, the biggest electricity provider, would have an annual bill of €1,274 based on the average usage of 4,200 kW a year. Of course there would be an increase in the use of electricity during winter with the increased use of heaters and household utilities such as tumble dryers and washing machines. Electricity bills for winter would obviously be higher than in summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The Government proposes that all electricity customers, including pay-as-you-go customers, will receive a once-off payment of €100 off their energy bill, which will be automatically applied to their accounts. While this is welcome, the proposed payment is a drop in the ocean compared to the high energy bills households are already paying. It will make little difference to those vulnerable individuals and families who have to make the choice between heating the house or putting food on the table. The present arrangement that exists for people who are on disability allowance, old-age pensions and other qualifying welfare payments is that they receive a discount of €35 a month on their energy costs. There are other similar allowances that can be availed of. I urge the Minister to increase such allowances substantially, particularly in view of the massive impact these energy bill increases are having on some of the most vulnerable in society. Realistically the once-off payment of €100 will not cushion the blow such increases in energy bills will have on these vulnerable people.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">I have to be quite frank. When I saw this proposal initially, I thought the Government really needs to try harder. This does nothing to tackle the spiralling energy costs and multiple price hikes over the last year. While it might take the edge off the winter electricity bill, it will do nothing for the ones coming after that. We know that the spiralling cost of living in this country is leaving those most vulnerable behind and leaving them in a significant amount of debt. CSO figures show the annual rate of inflation was at a 20-year high last month. That is mostly made up of jumps in costs of energy, transport and rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I spoke to a constituent this week who by chance found a shopping receipt from last year for her lunches for her children every week. Every single item on that receipt had gone up, some by a couple of cent and some by considerably more. That is the impact that people are feeling every single day. The finances are simply not there to meet that ever-increasing cost of living. They are under real pressure. They need to see from Government realistic, long-term solutions that are much more far-reaching than €100 off the next electricity bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> I want to raise another issue in respect of the universal aspect of this payment and wants versus needs. We have all come across that at some point. I do not know one person sitting in this Chamber who needs this payment. I can think of vast numbers of people in my constituency who need it. I will leave it up to Deputies' own moral compass as to whether they want this payment. There is nothing here about surrendering that money if we make the decision that we do not need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> There is nothing in this that deals with holiday homes. My constituents will struggle to put food on the table, a roof over their heads and shoes on their kids' feet but another individual in a financial position to own two properties will get this payment twice. There is gross inequity in that as surely the Minister of State sees. I also ask that the Minister of State engage meaningfully with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It does tremendous work in communities the length and breadth of this country. It too is under substantial pressure from people coming to it in dire straits because of utility bill debt. Will the Minister of State engage with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> We have heard the fuel allowance bandied about on media in recent days. The fuel allowance needs reform but while the Government is focusing on those who receive the allowance, it is completely disregarding those who do not qualify for it, who are ineligible but still have to put food on the table and a roof over their heads and still have that ESB bill coming in the door. If the Minister of State gets a couple of minutes this afternoon he should read the comments on the poll the <i>journal.ie</i> is running.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this Bill and to express our disappointment that this is what we are seeing from the Government as a way of addressing the crisis in the cost of living that is sweeping across the country and affecting every community. As we are coming through the crisis of the pandemic, the Government has to confront the twin crises of the climate emergency and the cost-of-living crisis, which has manifested so strikingly and seriously for so many families, households and individuals across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> While we accept that this is well meaning and that households will welcome the rebate proposed in the Bill, we are of the view that it is simply insufficient and inadequate to deal with the reality of the spiralling cost of living. We know that households are expecting, on electricity and gas alone, more than €400 of an increase on their bill this year following the price increases imposed. We know there are soaring costs associated with housing, rental, childcare, even in purchasing food and groceries. It is deeply disappointing to see Government putting forward this drop in the ocean. If I may mix metaphors, it is clutching at straws in putting forward this drop in the ocean as a way to address the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Indeed if what we are hearing in terms of leaks from the Minister of State's colleagues' parliamentary party meeting last night is correct, it appears both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste agree with our analysis that the measure as proposed in the Bill is not enough to address the cost-of-living crisis. It is not enough of an answer. Much more needs to be done. We are hearing all sorts of kites being flown as to what can be done by Government. It is very disappointing to see that all we are getting by way of concrete proposals and legislation is a €100 rebate. It is tokenistic. It seems somewhat random if I may say so. It is certainly not a targeted or strategic way to address the reality of increased costs of living for so many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> This view is shared by so many of our constituents. Looking at my own emails from constituents in Dublin Bay South today, a constituent writes that she is a working mother with a two-year-old son. She and her husband both work. They are writing to a public representative for the first time ever, out of pure desperation. I know the Minister of State is hearing it in his own constituency as we all are. They have been involved in what she describes as excruciating bidding wars with insane prices in housing. They are trying to buy a house. They are both earning, they have relatively good incomes but they cannot afford a home. We are hearing from people renting about increased costs of rental. We are hearing from people who themselves are not struggling but who are incensed. A constituent wrote to me today saying they are growing more and more annoyed about the communications about the €100 rebate and pointing out that this initiative will cost the Government over €200 million, which could be spent in a significantly better way. My constituent describes it as a populist reactive gesture which does not help those who are in genuine poverty or genuine fuel poverty. That really sums up what we all on the Opposition benches are hearing in constituents and members of the public as to their view on this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> We accept that there are issues beyond the Government's control driving up the cost of living. The Russian aggression on the borders of Ukraine is clearly a case in point. Yet there is much more that can be done at domestic level through legislation or other policy interventions to address the cost of living and the impact that international issues like the Russian aggression are having on individuals and households. We are saying that the Government can do more to address the scale of the crisis. For example, one of the key reasons the cost of living and rise in fuel prices are hitting so hard is that wages have not risen. Here is a way of addressing this. Let us look at how we can address the wage issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">We know that people on low pay and those in receipt of the minimum wage are the most affected of all by increases in the cost of living where they have seen no commensurate increases in their incomes. Here is one alternative way the Government can address this, namely, by increasing Ireland's minimum wage of €10.50 per hour to an hourly living wage of €12.90. Instead, we see a measure that is simply not strategic, not targeted and, therefore, not enough to address the cost of living for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> The Bill is flawed in its approach to renters in particular. We will table amendments on that, as will others. Looking again at my constituency of Dublin Bay South, as many as 44% of all properties there are private rentals. That is a very large proportion of households in my constituency and my local area. In the south inner city, Portobello, Ranelagh, Rathmines and other areas in the constituency, we see large numbers of individuals and families renting. The lack of integration of renters into the proposed statutory framework of the Bill is concerning. The Minister of State addressed this in his speech. We would welcome copies of the speech in order that we might look at that. He stated that he hopes to work with, I think, the RTB on this issue. The figures we have show that as many as half or more of households that rent will have their landlord's details on the electricity bill. That needs to be addressed because while clearly it is to be hoped that landlords will pass on the small saving in bills to renters, we cannot guarantee that.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> As I understand it, there is an absence of safeguarding measures in the Bill. The Bill looks at fuel prices, but let us look at the crisis in the cost of living in other areas. Let us hear from the Government about measures to address that. Daft.ie tells us that rents are rising at an annual rate of 6.8% and that Dublin is the sixth most expensive capital city in the world for renters. The average rent for a one-bed unit in my constituency is €1,643 per month. Let us contrast that with stagnant wages and low pay. The only capital cities which can compete with ours on rent are cities like Hong Kong, Singapore, Washington and London. We need to ensure that renters are getting adequate safeguards. The Bill clearly does not go anywhere near addressing the issue of rent increases, but let us ensure at the very least that savings on energy bills are passed on to renters. That is a key issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I hope the Government will work with me and with my colleague, Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson, to see our renters' rights Bill passed. That Bill would deal with three key issues that clearly impact renters' experience and quality of life, including security of tenure and the cost of rent. We are calling for a three-year rent freeze and for measures to be passed to give renters greater rights to quality life and things like the right to rent an unfurnished apartment or home, which is the norm in other European cities. Our Bill would also end no-fault evictions and restrict the grounds on which a landlord can end a tenancy. What we are seeking is greater protections for renters. That in itself, particularly that three-year rent freeze, will help to address the cost of living for many, ensuring then that rents are capped and that renters have greater security.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I have talked to constituents, especially those who are coming to Ireland from other countries to work and who are appalled at the lack of protection for renters here compared with their own countries. I am told that the norm in other European cities is a three-year rental agreement. Why are we in Ireland wedded to 12-month leases? That gives nobody security. It does not give private landlords security either. I know we have many so-called accidental landlords, and I hear from many constituents in that position too. Why not move to that European norm of a three-year lease as the legal basis for rental agreements? We need to look really carefully at how we can protect renters better and ensure that we target cost-of-living increases in rental and tenancy costs. That is a key issue that is causing so much hardship across the country, particularly in our cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Last week, the Labour Party put forward a motion on the cost of living which sought to create or to propose a broader package of measures to ensure we address some of these issues - not just energy prices but also issues such as the price of accommodation, rent and house purchase. We put that motion forward also in a context in which we have seen from Oxfam figures showing that there has been a significant increase of wealth for a very small number of individuals in our society. Those figures were very striking and show that the wealth of Ireland's nine billionaires had increased by nearly 60% since March 2020 while most people have seen incomes and wages stagnate and the cost of rent, fuel and food increase. With all the talk and all the really admirable solidarity we have seen as we have gone through the Covid pandemic and the public health restrictions required by it, it is frustrating to read of these figures, particularly when we know how much fuel and energy prices are rising, how much childcare costs are rising and how much rent has risen for so many. That context makes this proposed measure feel tokenistic. It requires us to put forward a systematic approach to reducing the cost of living in all areas. That is what we sought to do in our motion last week. We were very disappointed the Government did not accept the motion in the good faith and the constructive spirit in which it was offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Among the measures we put forward were the introduction of an emergency energy costs relief package for households. We called for targeted support for those in energy poverty through the widening of access to the fuel allowance and the introduction of a refundable carbon tax credit for low-income households. We had proposed that measure in our alternative budget last October, so it is not a new idea but, rather, something we believe would offer a much more targeted way of addressing rising fuel costs. It would offer practical support to people while supporting the phasing out in the longer term of fossil fuels, a much more realistic approach to the task at hand than an effective subsidy of fossil fuels. Ours is a measure that seeks to address the other crisis I have mentioned, which, I know, the Minister of State and his party are very aware of, namely the climate crisis and the crisis of rising carbon emissions. We also call for a windfall levy to be imposed on excessive profits made in the energy sector to offset rising prices. We have seen such a measure introduced in other jurisdictions recently. That would look at targeting not only the cost-of-living crisis but also that key crisis of the climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I wish to locate the debate on the cost of living and this debate within the context of that climate crisis. It sometimes feels as if there is a rather disjointed approach to policy on the part of the Government. We heard of that disjointed or disconnected approach in the leaks from the parliamentary party meetings of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael last night, with apparently different views being put forward by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste as to how to address the cost of living, whether to increase the rebate or look at other measures. We are all agog, waiting to see what will come out of that. It is a disjointed approach, however. We see that disconnection even more when we try to link the climate crisis with the cost-of-living crisis. Let us not forget that in November and December there was a period of about six weeks when we were in this Chamber several times per week, rightly, discussing Ireland's need to meet its ambitious climate targets. I and my party support the Government in seeking to meet those ambitious targets and we support the carbon tax, but we are disappointed to see a lack of joined-up thinking when we see measures such as this come from the Government without commensurate measures to address the climate crisis, which has not gone away just because we are focusing on inflation in this debate. While being conscious that inflation is at a 20-year high, we need to ensure that the measures we are taking to address that crisis for people will also match the measures we take on the climate crisis. For example, a number of people around the country availed of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy warmer homes scheme for smaller insulation projects many years ago but are now seeking to undertake further works which would have the effect of reducing energy costs for people while also reducing emissions. Many people are excluded from the scheme because a period of ten years has not yet passed since the initial project. That is problematic. It would be easy for the Government to fix that. Doing so would address both climate and cost-of-living issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Last month, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to ask if he would amend the SEAI rules on the one home, one visit restriction on the warmer homes scheme to allow homeowners to reapply for works that were not supported by grants in the 2014 scheme, such as external wall insulation on houses in which the walls are solid and therefore ineligible, and if he would consider loosening that problematic ten-year limit. The Minister, in his reply, revealed that there were no such plans to ease the burden on lower income households, which are particularly vulnerable to energy poverty. I would like to hear more from the Minister of State about the logic of that decision. It simply does not seem logical to me and does not seem to connect with a joined-up approach to Government thinking. I am conscious that Ireland is very far off our retrofitting target of 50,000 and that there is a need to accelerate rapidly the rate at which we are enabling people to retrofit homes. Lots of measures are being taken at ground level to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Just last Friday I had the pleasure of officiating at a graduation ceremony for a group of people who had just finished an intensive programme in construction skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">It was being run by the brilliant people at St. Andrew's Resource Centre on Pearse Street in co-operation with a range of State agencies, including the Dublin Port Company, which supplied the land for the course to be run. The organisers of the course, which has an excellent 63% job placement rate, are putting together a course on retrofitting and green homes with a view to upskilling sufficient numbers of people to undertake the smaller scale retrofitting projects that will make a difference to many individuals and households experiencing energy poverty. It will also make a major difference to meeting our domestic climate targets for households.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> The inspirational approach being taken by those involved in this training programme is admirable and they have been supported by Ministers and Deputies from across the parties, yet they are scrambling for funding to continue the programme. This is just one example of where we see initiatives that would greatly assist in addressing fuel poverty issues and the climate crisis but where we do not see joined-up Government thinking in supporting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> We are proposing measures at national level through the Dáil. We are also looking for Government support for local initiatives. We believe that this sort of joined-up thinking would be preferable to the tokenistic, scattergun or even confetti approach that is being taken with the sort of measure before the House today. We need to see more targeted measures to tackle the cost of living. I cannot say that enough. We need to see radical measures like a three-year rent freeze, cuts to public transport prices and the carbon tax credit proposed in our budget. These are the types of measures that will make a real difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> We must be conscious that the reality of low pay and job insecurity for many people is being exaggerated by the current inflation figures. That is the stark context of the €100 rebate. It is inadequate when contrasted with average heating price increases of more than €770 or when considered in light of data from the Parliamentary Budget Office suggesting that inflation will offset increases in the contributory State pension such that the purchasing power the pension carries will decrease.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> Given that we are in a context of rising inflation and we are conscious of the reality of low pay and job insecurity for far too many, the more targeted package of measures that we are calling for needs to be adopted by the Government so that people do not have to make a call between paying for food and paying for energy, which is the reality for too many. We need to see more ambitious, more targeted and more strategic approaches from the Government, approaches that show joined-up thinking and a co-ordinated tackling of the two giant crises facing us, namely, the climate emergency and the crisis that is being felt by all too many in the cost of living and spiralling increases in rents, housing costs, fuel, food and, indeed, childcare, which is an issue on which I hope we will see radical measures being taken by the Government. We will be pushing for that.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_785">This legislation is the Government's response to the excessive costs and burdens being placed on households by electricity bills. It might be a welcome reprieve for the moment at a cost of €215 million, but it does little to guarantee that we will not be here again throwing hundreds of millions of euro more of taxpayers' money at meeting bills that are far too excessive and well in excess, I might add, of genuine contributing factors like international gas prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> As I have stated in the Dáil and media commentary, I have deep concerns about the ESB. In the first half of 2021 while businesses throughout the country struggled and hundreds of thousands of people fought to survive on the pandemic unemployment payment, the ESB announced an increase of €114 million in operating profits. Before exceptional items, its operating profit was €363 million. Equinor, one of the world’s largest players in the energy market, has pulled out of a joint arrangement with the ESB, seemingly unable to make things work in Ireland. I have challenged the ESB on several fronts - questioning its role in energy costs, how public service obligations benefit it and how it is regulated - and sought an investigation into manipulation of the energy market. Most of all, I cannot understand how we have arrived at a situation where there is such a grave lack of energy security in a country that is brimming with energy sources. I have decided to take these ESB and regulatory issues to the European Union for a state aid investigation and to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for an investigation of the ESB's price hikes in the wholesale energy market, which impact thereafter on householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> In recent years, our State has proven unable to oversee the ESB. We do not seem to have been able to supervise or regulate it properly. We have also failed in developing new forms of energy supply. We know that renewable generation accounts for 40% of the energy grid, but the majority of those renewables are land-based wind projects, and when the wind stops blowing we can see its impact on the wholesale energy market and, consequently, household energy bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> I believe that the European Commission will now ensure that the ESB is properly overseen and regulated. Since EU regulation will ensure a functioning company and market for the consumer, it will not be in the State's interests to continue to own the ESB. It has served a useful purpose over the decades and has been an asset for the State, but the time has come to have a debate on its ownership. The State has often been a pointless owner of assets and a terrible shareholder. It has also been unable to supervise the companies it owns, either lacking the technical people to see what its businesses are doing or the powers to curb them. Ownership is no longer the key determinant of how dominant companies operate. Rather, proper regulation is, and that is what the EU will insist upon. We should sell the company off and use the money to power our move into offshore wind and other industries for a green future. Of course, staff and other interested parties should be allowed to participate in the sale's proceeds, but the bulk must be used to invest in the future and ensure that we have a functioning energy market.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> The availability of a rich supply of sustainable energy will be the great commodity of the future. Ireland has potential in abundance and needs to maximise its geography to its advantage in the world. It is then that we will be sure that legislation such as this will not be necessary again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinKenny" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_790">This Bill is an emergency benefits scheme to give relief to families that have been victims of significant price increases across the board. Recently in my constituency, we held an online meeting of people who were concerned about the cost-of-living crisis they were facing. It could be broken down into a number of areas. Energy was one of the main ones - we are trying to do something practical about it today - but the major one was the cost of housing. Rent in particular is a significant problem for people, as is the cost of childcare. For people living in rural areas who must travel to work, fuel is a significant problem. Its cost has gone through the roof.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> We need to get a grip on this situation and recognise that the Government has to play an active role and try to support people through this period. I hope that it will be a short period. A concern I have about this Bill is that it is one-off legislation. We are going to the trouble of creating a Bill for a one-off payment when we should instead be providing for a regulation to allow this payment to be repeated if a similar crisis arises in future. Doing this would not place any extra cost on the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The Bill is a blunt instrument that gives the payment to everyone, even people who are well off and do not need it. An amendment could be made so that people in those circumstances could divert their payments to charities, which would then disburse the money to people in greater need of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I take slight issue with Deputy Cowen's proposal regarding the ESB. I have bad memories of Telecom Éireann, as will many of us who bought shares that ended up being worth nothing. We were told at the time that the only way to get broadband provision was to privatise the company and that the State was the block. Of all things, it was broadband that we could not get a hold of at that time. Here we are today in a very similar position. Nothing has changed. Before the State considers doing anything with the very valuable assets and companies that have been built up by hard work over many generations, any such move needs to be thought out very carefully. The mistakes of the past in that regard should never be repeated. While regulation may play a role in all of that, at the end of the day, we need hands-on State control of the company in an island economy like ours, which does not have access to neighbours that can provide energy to us as freely as would be the case if we had land borders with them. It would be a very retrograde step to go in the proposed direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> To go back to the Bill, we support it but it does not go nearly far enough to deal with the many problems people have. At the least, it needs to be recognised that the one thing we could do very simply, and which I implore the Government and Minister to do, is to amend the legislation to allow this measure to be repeated in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_795">I have some detailed comments to make about this Bill but first I must say that I find it alarming that there are calls from the Government backbenches to sell off and privatise the ESB. Given the issues we face in terms of energy security, our climate change challenges and the cost of living, which we are now discussing, any proposals to sell off or privatise the ESB need to be strongly opposed. Privatisation would be a disaster for this country. Privatising Telecom Éireann was an absolute disaster. We would now have broadband in public ownership and rolled out nationally, which is needed for economic and social reasons, if the disastrous decision to privatise Telecom Éireann had not been taken years ago to the benefit, of course, of the people who made money out of that privatisation process. Privatisation of core public services, including energy supply and security, has been a disaster in other countries. We should not be following any proposals or suggestions to do likewise here. I strongly oppose those calls. I call on the Government Ministers and every party in this House to oppose them as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> I welcome the opportunity to debate this Bill. The fact that this is an emergency measures Bill says a lot about how the Government has responded to rising energy costs, energy poverty and our future energy needs. There have been adequate opportunities for the Government to intervene ahead of rises in energy costs to establish short-term solutions such as income supports while adequately resourcing and funding long-term solutions such as a strategy for combating energy poverty, none of which has been done to date. My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, raised the need for Dáil statements on rising energy costs back in September, when rising energy costs were first predicted. That was more than four months ago. My colleagues in the Social Democrats and I have since consistently called for short-term income supports to support people and help buffer them from rising energy prices, pre-empting the cliff that many families could face far into the winter months. In all of that time, energy prices have shot up, with household electricity costs rising by approximately 70% from late 2020 to the end of last year. Some estimates calculate that these hikes have added an additional €1,000 to €1,300 to the average home's yearly expenses. This is nearly twice as high as previous calculations of approximately €700.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The Social Democrats have also called for families in receipt of the working family payment to be eligible for the fuel allowance and for the widening of the criteria for the means-tested energy components of the household benefits package. Unfortunately, the Government only saw fit to widen eligibility for fuel allowance to jobseekers who have been on the payment for more than 12 months, down from 15 months. Furthermore, basic social welfare payments only increased by €5 in budget 2022. There were no attempts to increase the qualified child payment to assist families with children, among other social welfare-related supports. As short-term measures go, these do not go far enough nor are they in line with the extent to which energy prices are increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> We also called for a moratorium on utility disconnections. While this was not granted, my colleague, Deputy Whitmore, did speak with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which confirmed the range of measures in place to help people struggling to pay their bills. These include switching supplier, engaging with the company, placing their name on a priority list of people suffering from a medical condition and engaging with the social welfare community officer for discretionary payment if they could not pay an upcoming bill. Of course, these are not sufficient and it is hard for people to negotiate these measures. Instead of applying a range of other short-term measures, the Government sharply focused its energy on a once-off emergency stopgap measure, which is really more about delaying and scrambling than reacting properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> This payment is cited as being one of a suite of measures to mitigate the effects of the recent significant rises in electricity prices, which includes support through the social protection system. It is a mystery as to what this suite of measures actually comprises when existing supports have not been increased to the extent required in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Furthermore, the payment is not targeted. According to the last census, there are 62,000 holiday homes in Ireland. Under the Government's current plan to issue €100 credit to every household in the country, more than €6 million will be spent to provide financial assistance to the owners of these homes. I do not accept the argument that holiday home owners should be in receipt of Government assistance to pay their bills. I feel more work could have been done to target this payment better towards those who are really struggling with bills at the moment. The Government has stated that it cannot target this support at those most in need as it would be overly complex to do so. That contention is dubious given that the scheme was announced in December and the credit will not be paid until March, a period of four months during which a more targeted approach could have been devised.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, questioned the request to waive prelegislative scrutiny, through which there would have been an opportunity to look at this in more detail and come up with a solution. It could have been done quickly and in a timely manner through the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. Was the removal of holiday homes ever considered? Were ways to make this payment more targeted looked into and, if so, to what extent?</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> In the long term, we need to think about implementing a new strategy to combat energy poverty. Such a strategy is nowhere to be seen. Despite there having already been three strategies to combat poverty, there is no movement on a fourth. A review is currently being carried out of the implementation of the strategy to combat energy poverty, which the Minister said will be completed in the coming months and will inform the next steps with regard to the development of a new strategy. My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, submitted a parliamentary question asking for an update. It was put to her that significant progress had been made since the last strategy was published in 2016. Most of these commitments relate to increasing funding for numerous retrofitting schemes, many of which are still not operational. I do not believe this can be counted as progress as it will be years before people get the full benefit of living in warmer homes. Meanwhile, many people are slipping into the fuel poverty net with little support to keep them afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> On this topic, we can address both the financial and environmental cost of high energy prices by making our homes more energy efficient. Energy-efficient homes help reduce our carbon footprint as they require less fuel to heat but they also help to address fuel poverty. Despite Government strategies specifically aimed at tackling energy poverty, barriers to accessing grants persist, especially for low-income households. These are the households that are most likely to use solid fuels such as coal and peat but policies have often sidelined these very households, those that need the most support. The upfront costs associated with accessing sustainable energy grants act as a barrier for those on low incomes. Too often, subsidies are only taken up by those who can afford to make the necessary investment. Retrofitting is a prime example of this. As those who need them most can often not avail of the grants due to cost, in effect, these subsidies transfer wealth to households on higher incomes. With more than 230,000 homes having the lowest building energy ratings, F and G, it is imperative that the Government support these households by redesigning these schemes to make them more accessible. According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, those living in homes with ratings of F or G have a much higher indicative cost. In fact, a two-bedroom apartment with a rating of F or G has an indicative annual cost of €2,400 to €3,000, three to four times the fuel allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">As a household increases in size, so too does the heating cost. A three-bedroom semi-detached house with a low energy-efficiency rating costs between €3,200 and €4,000 to heat. The fuel allowance and other social welfare supports are not increasing in line with inflation or energy costs, which means a huge cohort of people is being left behind. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> There are other long-term initiatives that the Government needs to focus on better, including those associated with energy demand, renewable energy generation and just transition. With regard to energy demand and generation, an upgrade of the national grid must be a key element of infrastructural investment so communities, co-operatives, farms and individuals can produce renewable energy and sell what they do not use back to the national grid, thus becoming self-sustaining and contributing to meeting our national targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> Our energy infrastructure is not fit for purpose to address the everyday energy needs of people living in Ireland, so it can hardly cater for large-scale projects such as data centres. In that context, we need to acknowledge the energy demand on an energy system that is wholly antiquated. The facts speak for themselves. The annual increase in energy demand from data centres in the past four years was the equivalent of adding 140,000 households to the power system each year. This is not sustainable and it is now threatening our energy security, investments worth billions of euro, and thousands of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> My colleague, Deputy Jennifer Whitmore, has spoken many times on this issue. We do not tire of saying we need a strategy to manage the current and future energy demands in respect of data centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> Our energy infrastructure needs rapid modernisation to meet not only our energy needs but also our climate action goals. Our renewed ambition to meet the target of having 80% of our energy generated using renewable resources by 2030 is now aligned with our climate action plan and will require an urgent overhaul of the outdated legislation facilitating the development of offshore wind farms. There are many wind farms planned for locations off the east coast that will generate a huge amount of green electricity, but the capacity will be threatened if any delays are incurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> We need a management strategy to manage current and projected energy demand in Ireland so we can prevent energy price hikes, ensure people can afford the energy they need and assist people with their capacity to adapt to climate change and lower their carbon footprint. Right now, the Government is expecting individuals to take on too great a burden to adapt to climate change. They can barely keep afloat considering the current cost of living. This is an important point if we are to bring people with us, which we need to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> With regard to just transition, we are at a crossroads. We need to start examining and meeting our climate action targets and our reduction targets together because the two go hand in hand. This will be important in building and maintaining public support in the years to come. If we do not do that successfully, it will threaten our capacity to have support in meeting our climate action targets. This is incredibly important. It should be a priority for all of us, particularly the Government, considering what we need to do by way of climate action in the coming years. If we do not do so properly, we will put in jeopardy the support for the many actions that will be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Eliminating energy poverty and protecting people from it should comprise a key pillar of any just transition platform, which many organisations, including Social Justice Ireland, advocate. Groups such as Social Justice Ireland advocate a wide range of incentives to reflect these priorities and call for a focus on short- and long-term costs of addressing energy poverty for various groups in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The Minister has spoken regularly about just transition when it comes to achieving our climate change and climate action targets; however, these words can sound very hollow unless increases in social welfare payments are introduced to help people to manage the increased burden of rising energy prices, and unless there are supports for people on low incomes in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Significant investment across all platforms must be made to ensure our society meets its climate targets and to have a just transition. Ireland has significant work to do in this area and has consistently been one of the poorest performers in the European Union in meeting emissions targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> To secure energy supply in the future, we need to ramp up renewable energy development and make inroads to reform the current planning regulatory environment. While it is welcome that moves to provide a scheme for households to sell solar power back to the grid are being progressed, we have an ambitious renewable electricity target to meet. The climate action plan has set out an ambitious goal of generating up to 80% of electricity from renewables by 2030. Reform of the Irish planning regulatory environment has been slow and we risk not facilitating the levels of investment needed to meet the renewable energy targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Meanwhile, the Government has complicated matters by prioritising the development of maritime consents without giving equal priority to looking towards Government commitments to expand Ireland’s marine protected area network from 2.13% to 30% by 2030. This will require creating a marine protected-area regime, which requires another major change to current marine environmental protection laws. Sufficient inroads have not been made to put this on a statutory footing. It is another example of the crossroads we are at, where our climate action targets are meeting social issues such as energy poverty. We need to secure our energy for the future through renewables to reduce poverty, but we need to reduce energy poverty without also damaging our environment. If we do not proceed in this way, we will risk failing to make a socially just transition to a zero-carbon economy. It is not an easy crossroads to cross but it is certain that an emergency measure like the one we are debating will do nothing to create genuine, tangible pathways for people already in energy poverty, or at risk of poverty, to move towards a socially just zero-carbon economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_816">The rising cost of living is crippling many people. Constituents tell me regularly that the day-to-day costs of running a home are becoming unmanageable. The cost of electricity is without doubt one of the biggest issues for householders. The rising cost of electricity is a global trend, a trend that is creating cost-of-living issues right across the world. Here in Ireland, it is impacting renters, homeowners, young people, and pensioners. It is affecting ordinary hardworking people, whose salaries or hourly rates are not rising in line with the cost of electricity. Therefore, I really welcome this emergency measure from the Government to provide a one-off relief payment of €100 towards each household’s electricity bill. This will put €210 million back where it is needed, in people’s pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> I was contacted by many constituents who welcomed this measure when it was announced in December. I am really pleased we are able to move on it now. It has been hard to put together but it is really welcome. I ask the Minister of State to consider establishing a hardship fund to help families and individuals who may need additional support to meet the rising cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> While I welcome the payment to help with the cost of electricity, I believe we should also be focusing on long-term sustainable options to make electricity more affordable. Ireland has huge potential to deliver renewable wind energy at a massive scale. This would give us the opportunity to create new jobs in rural towns and villages along the coast, meaning we would be investing in and renewing those communities. Ireland could produce 20% of the offshore renewable energy of the entire European Union in 20 or 30 years. Think about that for a second. Wind energy could become our biggest contributor to reducing carbon emissions and creating tens of thousands of jobs outside our core cities. It would mean creating sustainable, affordable energy streams.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> In Ireland, we have one of the world’s strongest wave capacities and steady winds, which give us a unique resource, but this resource is not tapped into sufficiently. That is why I really welcomed the Maritime Area Planning Bill both on Committee Stage and when it was before the Dáil last month. The Bill will help us to achieve our renewable energy targets for 2030 and bring in a much-needed planning regime for offshore wind. While I welcome the one-off cost reduction concerning electricity bills, it is really important that we continue to work on developing sustainable electricity provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> I have also been contacted by some constituents who have taken steps to retrofit their homes. They are concerned over the prospect of rising energy costs given that they may be spending more time working from home.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">That is why they have made that sustainable switch. While it is right for the Government to do whatever is in our power to tackle the rising cost of traditional energy, it is also an opportunity for us to encourage homeowners to make the switch to long-term, more affordable and sustainable sources of energy. We can do that by incentivising people financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> I recently got a query from a constituent who was looking to install a new solar panel system. Altogether, with fitting and parts, the cost came to €9,000 in total. They researched all the necessary materials and components, all high-quality and all sourced in Ireland with long warranties, and found the cost came to about €3,000 for materials alone. They will receive a grant of €3,000 towards the cost, but it will still leave a shortfall of €6,000 for installation and labour, which I am told takes about two days. What is causing such overhead costs? Do we need to consider increasing the retrofit grant? What can we do to support people who want to make that sustainable switch? Not many people can afford €9,000 to install solar panels.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> I welcome the interim relief that this payment will give to families who are struggling to pay their electricity bills. I welcome all further long-term actions to alleviate the cost of living for the many people who are struggling with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I welcome the news that both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste finally acknowledged last night that this €100 credit does not go far enough to help people who are trapped in the cost-of-living crisis. When this proposal first came up, we in Sinn Féin explained that it would not be enough. It has taken too long for the Government to realise this. It goes to show how out of touch the Government is with ordinary people and the cost-of-living crisis that ordinary families must live through every week. The crisis affects everyone. At one time, this would just affect those in poverty, in social housing and on low incomes. However, we are now hearing that this is affecting people with good jobs, including families with both parents working. The cost increases in electricity, gas, oil and rent are now crippling families and other people who are trying to work and get by.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> I will give one example. Home heating oil has increased by 53%. In May of this year, the Government will introduce the carbon tax which will drive these prices up even more. What the Government is doing is a scandal and shame. During the Covid-19 crisis we all stood together, but that seems to be the only time the Government will stand with people. We have a crisis in the cost of energy for ordinary people who are trying to live. Where is the Government's €100? People need it now. Many people are in trouble today. Why is it not being delivered? Why was this kicked down the road?</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> This is no longer just affecting certain people; everyone is feeling it. For the first time in over two decades, the cost of living is going through the roof. However, what is really worrying is that the penny is only dropping now and the Government is still not taking the action needed. People have been feeling this for months. The Government ignores our calls, ignores people and ignores the bills that are going through the roof. Sinn Féin wants to bring forward credible solutions. We want to help people through this crisis. The first thing that should happen is a rent freeze.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> This week, I was contacted by a lady who is worried about her electricity being cut off. Will the Government allow people's electricity to be cut off at this time of year? It is wrong. It is finally time for the Government to stand up and realise that this is a crisis and that it needs to act now.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_828">I will be sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. People are facing additional costs to heat their homes. The estimates vary but €800 over the year is a reasonable estimate by <i>bonkers.ie</i>. Against that background, €100 is pathetic and insulting. It is a drop in the ocean and will not cut it. It is good the Government seems to be acknowledging that more needs to be done, as others have said. We made the point during the debate on the budget that a €5 increase and failure to expand eligibility for the fuel allowance were just not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> When the scheme was first announced towards the end of the year, we were very clear in saying it was pathetic and was not enough. The Government did not understand that people were literally choosing between food and heating their homes, or between paying the rent and heating their homes. People are being hammered in every direction. A payment of €100 against that background is utterly pathetic and insulting. The Government will need to do much more now.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> The one piece of advice I strongly urge the Government not to take is the shocking suggestion that came from Deputy Cowen a few moments ago. How wrong can somebody be? Deputy Cowen must be out of his mind to suggest the answer to the current spiral in energy costs is to privatise the ESB. That is the last thing we need to do. In fact, the decision to move the ESB away from being a not-for-profit entity to being essentially a commercial entity, even though it is publicly owned, was the beginning of the onward and relentless drive upwards in the cost of electricity and energy. Privatisation is the problem. The commodification of energy supply and distribution has been a total disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> This is the key point we need to make. Some people present inflation or a rising cost of living as if it is like the weather and it is just that the weather has changed. We need to take measures, maybe short-term measures or maybe slightly longer term measures, to deal with change in the weather. Inflation is not a change in the weather. Inflation is one group of people robbing another group of people. We really need to get that into our heads. The ESB last year made €363 million in operating profit and that was low compared with the previous year when it made €616 million in operating profits and paid out €81 million in dividends. When the pockets of working people are looted with shocking increases in the price of electricity or gas or heating oil, somebody else is making money.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> That is true on a global scale and it is true domestically in this country. Shell is crowing about its quarterly profits. Shell's quarterly global sales, mostly of gas, were €6.4 billion, a dramatic increase. It pointed out that 2020 was a bit of a tough year for it, but it is all over now and it is enjoying a bonanza. In just three months it has made €6.4 billion. Those who buy shares in Shell, as I am sure plenty of rich people in this country do, or those who have shares in any of these privatised energy companies, including some of the ones that will or are producing wind energy, are doing fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> People who are private or public tenants have absolutely no control whatsoever over the level of insulation in their homes and, as a result, the amount of energy they need to heat them. Many social housing or private tenants are screwed and crucified. A disproportionate number of the hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers or people in receipt of disability or other social welfare benefits are being absolutely crucified just to keep themselves warm. On top of that, they have to pay rent. All of that is going into somebody else's pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> The decision to cut back supplies globally during the Covid pandemic was done to keep up profits. It is as simple as that. It was not done based on people's energy needs, but rather to maintain profits and so that companies could keep paying dividends to people who can afford to put their extra wealth into buying shares in large corporations. That is the reality of the situation. Inflation is not caused by weather or a natural phenomenon; rather, it is one group of people using a crisis to loot the pockets of the people who can least afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Our starting point has to be that recognition, and that then dictates what sorts of short- and long-term measures the Government takes. In the short term, we need to control the price of energy, electricity and heating. We need to introduce price caps, just as in order to control the spiralling cost of rent we need to introduce rent controls. Anything less will not cut it. If we leave it to the market, these people will continue to ensure their profits are high, whether from energy and electricity or the rents and wealth they generate. We need controls so that the basic things that people need to survive are affordable for ordinary people. Anything less is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Nobody else in the House seems to want to talk about this stuff. We have pointed out that under the Consumer Protection Act, the Government has the power to declare an emergency regarding the cost of energy and impose maximum unit price costs. Why will the Government not do that? My God, the Government was pouring billions into large corporations to keep them propped up during the Covid pandemic, but it seems we cannot introduce the same kinds of emergency measures to control the price of energy and electricity in companies that, I repeat, are making lots of profit and could well absorb that. That is what should happen, in particular when those companies are publicly owned.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> My God, the Government should not make a bad situation worse and pour fuel on the fire – sorry for the pun – by privatising these entities and driving them further in the direction of profit rather than ensuring that we provide for the energy needs of people in this country. God Almighty, it is absolutely shameful. I have never been a fan of Fianna Fáil, but at least at one point it constructed Ardnacrusha, established the ESB and so on and created an energy company-----</p>

          <p eId="para_840">Fine Gael is claiming the credit for that. Apologies. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil - it does not make much difference in truth. It is the same to us. The idea was to have a State company, rather than leaving it to the private market to produce energy. A publicly owned company was created which operated on a not-for-profit basis. That is what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We also need to extend eligibility for the fuel allowance to the many pensioners and low-paid workers who are being absolutely crucified by energy costs. We need to dramatically reduce, or withdraw, carbon taxes. Why are tenants or low-paid workers who cannot afford, through their own resources, to retrofit their homes being punished for what other people are doing? Why are they being punished more than people who have the money to retrofit their homes? Those who have the money, as wealthy people do, can mitigate the cost of energy price hikes. It is the working people, the poor, the less well-off and public and private tenants who are being absolutely crucified by this and do not have the resources to do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> The Government should reduce the level of VAT, as the Spanish have done, and the PSO levies. Plenty of measures could be taken to deal with this. We also need to address the income inequalities which are being exacerbated by the inflation crisis, not just the 5.7% or 4.4% projected for next year because they are averages. Inflation is disproportionately higher for people who have to spend a larger proportion of their income on rent or keeping a roof over their head.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> We need to provide wage increases to working people. I met a group of private security workers, a group we have not talked about much in the past while. They provide security in hospitals and on public transport. They work in all sorts of public and private buildings. They are earning €11.65 per hour. How is somebody supposed to live on that? They cannot get a miserable pay increase to bring them up to €12.05 per hour because of some employment regulation order, ERO, thing. Wages should be increased to a decent living wage like €15 per hour. Everybody should be given increases that at least match the rate of inflation so that they can cope with the increased cost of living being imposed on them. </p>
          <p eId="para_844"> As well as the energy side of things, we have to deal with the biggest cost for most people, which is putting a roof over their heads. That means introducing rent controls and not relying on the market to deliver housing supply, something it is proving to be completely incapable of doing. We need to deliver the scale of public affordable housing we need, which profit-hungry private property investors are not willing or able to do.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_342">

          <p eId="para_845">I cannot think of the last time that, by the time the Government came forward on Second Stage with a proposal, it had basically publicly acknowledged it was not good enough and would not do anything. That is the state we are in now, given the comments that have been reported from yesterday's parliamentary party meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> On the one hand, it speaks to the scale of the crisis facing ordinary people, in terms of the rising cost of living, of which energy prices are a key driving component, and the pressure that the Government feels. On the other hand, it speaks to the inadequacy of the proposals it has to deal with that. </p>
          <p eId="para_847"> We can go back to the motion we put forward on the energy crisis four or five months ago, where the response of the Government was an amendment where the punchline said the market will solve all the problems and that we should rely on the free market. The free market means energy prices continue to go through the roof. The big energy companies are taking advantage of the situation to increase prices again and again and continue to make massive profits. All the Government has to offer people on the receiving end of this price gouging is €113. It is a drop on a hot stove, will be wiped out by the price increases immediately and made to appear minuscule.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> The over-reliance of this Government and previous Governments on fossil fuels to power the economy has left Ireland at the mercy of global supply chain bottlenecks, as industries and countries try to boom back after the Covid pandemic lockdown and shifting global weather patterns lead to greater energy use. Price increases are compounded by the Government's strategy of making ordinary householders foot the bill for gas and electricity infrastructure instead of ensuring it is paid for in a fairer and more equitable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> It is worth comparing the price households in this country pay for gas with elsewhere in the EU. In the second half of 2019, they paid 12% above the EU average. Electricity prices were 11% above the EU average in 2019. In 2021 they were 18% above the EU average. What is the consequence of high energy prices?</p>
          <p eId="para_850">It hits those who are already struggling to pay the rent and buy groceries and who must make the choice between heating and eating.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Looking at the figures for deaths from cold-related diseases or excess winter deaths as a consequence of the cold and people not being able to heat themselves properly, they are astounding. There are 2,800 people who die this way per year, and we can put that in the context of Covid-19. We were in favour of taking the best possible approach to minimise the impact of Covid-19 and deaths arising from it. Approximately 2,300 excess deaths were recorded during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic between March 2020 and February 2021, so the number of excess winter deaths is more than the number of excess deaths from Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> Contrary to what Deputy Cowen suggested earlier, the roots of the Irish aspects of this problem lie precisely in the direction of the privatisation and deregulation that has been going on. The answer is to move in the opposite direction, as opposed to what Deputy Cowen suggests. From the 1990s onwards, the EU sought to break up state-run energy companies across Europe, such as the ESB and Bord Gáis. In 1996 and 1998, the EU introduced the first electricity and gas directives, which forced states to open their energy systems and sell power plants and infrastructure to private capitalists. The Irish Government did not then seek derogations from these directives, despite the fact the small size of the Irish market would exacerbate the worst effects of privatisation. In 1999, Fianna Fáil introduced the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, opening the market to competition, and two years later it removed the not-for-profit mandate of the ESB. Formerly public companies that were run on a not-for-profit basis were forced into a market, requiring them to behave instead like private capitalists seeking higher rates of profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> The consequence of this has been predictably disastrous. Prices, rates of energy poverty, disconnections and the number of cold-related deaths all rose dramatically. Privatisation or "unbundling" also brought inordinate costs. Each private company involved expects a rate of profit of approximately 8% on its investment so when the price of inputs increase, it passes on those increases to maintain its rate of profit. Energy supplier companies are charged for moving energy throughout the system and such charges are passed to ordinary energy users, making up a third of the household Bill. These are special transmission use-of-system charges paid by suppliers to EirGrid and Gas Networks Ireland for using their transmission network and distribution use-of-system tariffs paid to ESB Networks and Gas Networks Ireland to distribute energy. These charges are the third highest in the EU and, as I said, are a third of a user's bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Each company seeks to maximise its profit in a specific field and does not adopt an holistic approach to energy consumption. A reduction in energy usage runs counter to these companies' economic interests, and this means those interests are the opposite of the interests of society at large. The first renewable energy, in a sense, is energy efficiency or reducing the amount of energy we are using. This would get us off the track of a huge expansion in the use of data centres, although unfortunately the Government still seems to be committed to this. We should encourage users to reduce energy usage but such measures are not being adopted. Instead, the focus is on forcing households to remain locked into high energy use and prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Irish homes are consuming 7% more energy than the EU average due to years of hands-off housing policy, low quality standards and a painfully slow retrofitting programme. The alternative, as outlined by Deputy Boyd Barrett, is immediate price control. The Government has the power to do this but refuses to do it. Price controls could be imposed tomorrow at the stroke of two ministerial pens; they would indicate the maximum unit price for gas, electricity or oil. A second element of this is renationalisation of the energy sector, using it as a lever for a rapid transition to renewable energy. A third element is massive State investment in retrofitting. The State should borrow the required money at low cost and do this retrofitting for households at zero cost. Over time, the benefit would accrue back to the State and household. It would be an absolute win for everybody in society and our environment.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_856">I am thankful for the opportunity to speak to the energy question for a few minutes in this Second Stage debate. I support the Bill and acknowledge, as others on both sides of the House have mentioned, that energy prices and fuel costs in general comprise one of the biggest issues facing citizens of the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Many previous speakers have outlined the increases that have taken place in the past few months but it is quite clear that the outlook and projections for the next six months are similarly on an upward trajectory.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I support the measure in the Bill to reduce the cost of electricity for individuals and families right across the country, I hope it or a similar measure can be used in future to ensure something like the particular spike we are experiencing now is not all transferred on to the backs of families and citizens right across the country. However, in my time in public life, we have not really in Ireland had an honest and open debate about energy policy. I disagree with many of the points made by Deputies Paul Murphy and Richard Boyd Barrett but they have certainly put forward their perspectives with their usual eloquence and energy. I do not necessarily or particularly agree with Deputy Cowen that privatisation of the ESB is the right option to consider at this point but at least he put forward his position. Everything in the current climate must be discussed. The Opposition failed in any of its criticism of Deputy Cowen to outline options. Those Members attacked the ESB and other energy providers about the cost at which they provide energy but they do not really provide any alternatives. Too often in this House and other chambers across the country, politicians of all stripes but particularly of the left and far left have portrayed an idea that there are easy options for energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> What do I mean by that? Currently in Ireland the Corrib gas field, for example, provides 40% of our gas needs but there was a considerable amount of opposition to its development within this Chamber, with no ready alternative being proposed. I question and criticise the decision of the Government to close the peat generation plants, not because peat generation should be sustained indefinitely but because that closure was effected in advance of securing an alternative. I am not trying to portray an image that microgeneration will solve all our energy needs but there were commitments given both in the programme for Government and when the Government was formed on targets for connections and people seeing rebates when supplying into the grid rather than taking energy out of it. I know the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is talking about reaching those now but it is about a year after the original projection. If we are to bring the public with us on what needs to be done in terms of energy projection, small wins like those for microgeneration and other alternatives must be secured. I welcome the fact it is happening now but it should have happened much sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> All of this matter flows into the area of planning policy. Virtually every roof in the country should have a solar panel, if at all possible. My part of the country in the south east has a nickname for having more sunshine than most other parts of the country. If a business or private dwelling is installing a flush solar panel on a roof, it should not have to go through the full rigorous planning process. I welcome the initiatives of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and his colleagues on the review of planning legislation. Again, it is another method of ensuring we can bring the public with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">We also have to realise, as I mentioned earlier, that while 40% of our gas comes from the Corrib field, we are on the end of the European gas pipeline. Issues and factors that are far beyond our control, issues that are now current in eastern Europe, will have an impact on energy into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> Every public representative has the right to oppose, object and express their view on development, whether it is in the energy field or any other. However, it is completely false to present to the public that there are soft options in terms of energy supply, because there are not. One of the things that particularly bothered me was the letter from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to An Bord Pleanála recently with regard to the liquefied natural gas, LNG, plant in Kerry. It is accepted by many experts in the field of energy, as well as in climate, that LNG is going to be a transitional fuel for many years to come. We have already outlawed fracking in this country. I voted for that, accept it and agree with it. However, in respect of LNG that is produced from other sources, thereby enabling us to refine it here, distribute it and not be dependent on our neighbour in the United Kingdom and giving us a level of energy security we do not have, it is wrong for a national Minister to get himself involved in an individual planning application. I know he has strong views and by all means he should express them. However, when it comes to an individual application by a private business, it is not presenting the full picture to the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> I agree, shockingly, with Deputy Boyd Barrett and others in respect of VAT and excise and factors that are within the control of the Government in terms of easing the cost of energy and fuel. I have never been a particular supporter of nuclear energy, perhaps because I grew up near enough to Carnsore and it was always a topical issue. We have never had a proper reasoned debate about whether it is something that could be a sustainable form of energy in Ireland in the future that should be considered and a rational debate had upon on it. I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I support the aims of this Bill. I hope it can be used in the future to provide similar relief for families across country.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">I also with to put on record my rejection of the suggestion from Deputy Cowen about selling off our shares in the ESB. It is sometimes referred to as selling off the family silver. That is a phrase I really disagree with. The family silver does not make money and does not pay dividends into the Irish economy. It is a myopic suggestion from Fianna Fáil that I hope will be utterly rejected. The ESB is not the equivalent of the family silver. It contributes to the Irish economy and selling it off is out of the question.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> We have been talking about this Bill for a long time and with the announcement of the €100 rebate, the Government has certainly got a lot of airtime out of it but here we are, debating it. Many of my constituents in north Kildare are absolutely terrified of the electricity and gas bills arriving through the letter box. The cost of living is absolutely rocketing. When people are already pared back to the minimum, some believe there is nothing left to give up. Some people are giving up a meal and many people find themselves in similar situations. I met a pensioner last month who had his coat on, on a really cold day because he was trying to make his fuel allowance go that bit further. I spoke to a mother last week who told me she keeps the heating off during the day because she wants to have it on when the kids come in from school because they are cold from being at school where all windows are open due to the lack of HEPA filtration in the classrooms. Heat is not a luxury; it is a basic human comfort. It is appalling that people are having to be so careful about putting on the heat. Nobody should have to see their family or their children shivering from the cold in the 21st century. We are going back to the days when pensioners travelled on buses during the daytime to try to keep warm. They cannot even do that now because we are in the middle of a pandemic and as every window on the buses is open, they are freezing there, too.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> This Bill is welcome insofar as it is long overdue but it could do much more for those who really need it. Those on €81,000 salary increases and earning €420,000 a year in public service jobs are going to get the same €100 rebate that families or individuals barely hanging on are going to receive. High earners do not really need the €100. Low earners need multiples of it. To maximise the impact and to highlight the emergency we are in, this payment should really be targeted. My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, already has stated we should have a mechanism by which those who can afford it could donate their €100 to a local charity. For example, the Society of St. Vincent De Paul is very good for helping people who are suffering from energy poverty. In addition, people with holiday homes really do not need to receive a double payment. It is also important that renters get the benefit. Deputy O'Rourke mentioned Travellers who pay their electricity costs into a local authority and we must ensure that they can avail of it. I am out of time.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">The Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill is basically a Government initiative to soften the blow of rising energy prices. However it is framed, it entails a once-off payment of €100 to every domestic electricity supply in the country. It is not being means-tested, as the Minister of State outlined, being too onerous for the Department to consider. As well as being paid to domestically occupied houses, the proposal is to pay it to vacant holiday homes also. One presumes the consumption of electricity will be very reduced with no occupancy. It also will be paid to the electricity account holder, which raises obvious questions in tenancy arrangements where the landlord is receiving the rebate. The Minister of State said he is hoping to engage with the Residential Tenancies Board. As I am sure he is aware, there are already significant difficulties in that sector. I do not know how that is going to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> The Minister of State's proposal has no relationship to the energy efficiency rating of a house or to the year of a house's construction, which might point to some properties with superior energy efficiency, and therefore allow some reduction in State payment. That shows how the Bill has been rushed in the first place. Within the legislation, it appears that the measures are to provide one month's help to families or individuals who actually incur 12 months of annual energy and electricity bills. Who is most affected by rising energy costs? Certainly, low-income families, single-income families and those in substandard accommodation who are paying to heat it. Others affected include those on fixed payment means, particularly pensioners who are on fixed pensions from many years ago, the elderly and those who require constant home heating, such as those who are infirm, those with potential illness and those on blood-thinning medications who always will feel cold and require the central heating to be on all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> In the legislation, did the Minister of State consider the rebate position of those who are on a pay-as-you-go electricity meter? Many of these customers are already paying a higher tariff, as the Minister of State is aware, because they are paying through a meter in the first instance and second, because they are often paying back a previous electricity bill. How are they to receive their rebate? What is the basis of this energy cost inflation? Is it Covid, supply chain interruptions, Russian tanks amassing, OPEC oil rationing, megaphone politicking threatening gas supplies to Europe or is it the re-emergence of global energy demand? These are all parts of the problem. In Ireland, have we also contributed to this domestic energy crisis? Could our decision to dispense with any more offshore gas development without considering viable alternatives be a factor? Could our decision to reduce coal and peat-burning electricity generation, again without viable alternatives, also be a factor? When we placed a carbon levy on fossil fuels, did we think that nobody in the population would notice that an increase in the cost of consumption and the cost of living would plainly follow? Did we think when we applied additional costs to the existing costs of production that they would not be seen on every utility bill and every shopping centre receipt in the country within weeks? Was the Economics 101 lesson missed by everyone in the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications framing climate and energy policy? I believe, as I am sure members of my Regional Group do, that this single proposed initiative will not be enough to protect the most vulnerable in our society. More will need to be done to support these families in the coming months and especially during those months when fuel consumption is high.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> This situation also gives rise to a wider debate about the nature of Ireland’s developing national energy and climate policy. We are talking about wind and solar power generation, but where is it? The Maritime Area Regulatory Authority is two years away from being set up yet. We need that agency to be able to control the development of our maritime space. How long will it be before Ireland becomes a net exporter of renewable electricity or even of hydrogen fuel? Equally, how long will it be before we fit and retrofit homes to a high energy standard and allow domestic generation of electricity through wind turbines and solar arrays? I ask because we are far from that situation yet. How long do we intend to remain completely dependent on the supply of international energy, when billions of euro worth of potential energy capacity are sitting off our shores in untapped gas and wind energy resources? We seem to be strategically unable to develop these resources. Instead, we are asking foreign conglomerates to come into this country to buy the rights and, to quote the Disney movie, to then charge us to infinity and beyond for the pleasure of consuming our own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> We in the Regional Group tabled a motion on wind energy some months ago which was accepted by the House. Some of the measures contained therein point to the potential existing in solar, gas and wind energy generation in this country. The generation of sustainable offshore wind energy would potentially lead to an investment of more than €100 billion in our economy. The time has come for us to get serious about climate change. We have done the talking and we have decided to get the population on board by telling them that we are charging them for what we are consuming. What we are not doing, and what we are absolutely failing to undertake now, is to institute real and meaningful policy and undertake change to generate and expedite the infrastructural development required in this regard. When we look at what is going on in Portugal, Spain, Germany and Denmark, how can we be so far behind? What is the delay in getting all these policies rolled out?</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I cannot say that I welcome this Bill, because the nature of the need it seeks to address is unwelcome. As already stated, we will have to do more to protect vulnerable families. I wait to hear what policies are going to be rolled out in that regard. Most importantly, the only way we can prevent future disruption to our energy supplies is to have our own sources. That means we must develop our own resources and we must get about it now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_872">It is interesting that we are having this debate. It is good that the original, much-maligned measure to provide support to electricity users was mooted in good time. The Government now has an opportunity to tweak that measure to address issues as they emerge, because they are going to be much more severe than was anticipated some months ago. It must be remembered that the Government has not been idle. Some €48 billion had to be spent in supporting the community, the business sector, employers and employees in order to ensure that the country stayed afloat. That was money well spent. Not every country was able to do it, but it was possible to do it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> We must recognise that it was not an easy time. Decisions had to be taken. The previous speaker made an interesting point regarding decisions. We need our own sources of energy, and we should have acted on this requirement years ago. For some unknown reason, we did not do that. The Ceann Comhairle will remember when I was targeted by people with a great deal of money who tried to ensure that I did not get re-elected because I was supporting the concept of having our own energy resources and of developing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Of course, there were objections in certain cases. Some of those objections were based on facts, but some were not. One thing was certain, though. That was the time to start building for our energy requirements. It was eventually decided that we would go out to sea and into the middle of the Atlantic or whatever the case may be. That is not the way to do the business. We have no chance of delivering power in ten years to the extent required from alternative energy sources, including wind generation from the Atlantic. We have no chance whatsoever of doing that because we would have needed to have that investment process already up and running eight to ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> What will we do next, then? Will we rely on our colleagues across the EU and the UK or where will we get our energy supplies at a price that we can afford when we need them? That latter point is the important aspect. I refer to being able to get energy when we need it and to how we can control the supply. The only way to control energy supplies is for us to own them. It is possible to do that. It is not rocket science. It has been done before and, undoubtedly, it can be done again. I agree with the reservations voiced by some people who say that we should not throw everything away until we have alternative sources of supply in sight and up and ready to run. We should, however, have such alternative energy resources in sight and we must invest now to bring those resources on stream. If we want something in five years’ time, we need to have started investing about four or five years previously. That is the way this works, and that is the way it will continue to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> My request is this. We recognise now what we must do and we must plan for it. We should not obfuscate as we have tended to do in the past and come up with several reasons why we should not do things when we try to do them. I refer to being able to continue to do things in different ways. Everybody in this country has their own way of doing things. Let us take the example of the national children's hospital. We talked about it for 20 years. After those 20 years, we still could not come to a decision on what was the right way to go about it. We also talked about the provision of broadband for years and years, and we debated it in this House <i>ad infinitum</i>. When it came to reaching a conclusion, it was said that we could not have that because what was suggested was too expensive and we would have to get it done some other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> It is not a good idea to do things on the cheap in the long term. The Ceann Comhairle and I know that well. Perhaps we have learned lessons. We may have learned how to invest in time and to do so strategically. We may also have learned to put in place the necessary measures to ensure that we do not have serious issues that we cannot handle rear up in our faces. The Ceann Comhairle can tell me how many minutes I have left.</p>

          <p eId="para_883">I am happy to have ceded some of my time to my colleague, Deputy Durkan. The €100 which is going to every electricity customer in the State is welcome. Similar schemes have been introduced in other EU countries. I am the Chair of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. Last week, the committee waived the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, which is going to bring relief to struggling householders. We were guided in our decision by officials of the Department. I thank them for coming into us, briefing us and helping us with that decision. I also thank the members of the committee who took that decision in the interests of the people of Ireland who are struggling to pay their energy bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> Listening to the debate, I heard few speakers refer to the reasons we have an energy crisis and why we are in a situation where we are making this €100 payment to electricity customers across the State. The energy crisis that we are experiencing is inexplicably linked with the security crisis looming on the other side of the Continent on the Ukraine border. Approximately 88% of all our energy is imported, and, for geopolitical reasons over which we have no control, the price of the energy that we use in Ireland has risen extraordinarily. As a result, as much as for sound climate reasons, we must wean ourselves off imported energy and especially energy imported from regions of the world which are politically unstable or, indeed, hostile to us. True energy independence and security of supply will come from developing our own indigenous energy resources. These resources are clean and renewable. We have more energy resources within the confines of our borders than we will ever be likely to need, yet we have barely started to harness them.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The events on the Ukraine border, as much as the climate crisis, compel us in Ireland to expedite our efforts. I argued a few weeks ago that it is in Europe's interest that Ireland should build up its deep-water port capacity as fast as possible to stage arrays of thousands of large wind turbines off the Atlantic coast, and that our interconnection capacity should be ramped up so that we, not the Russians, can send vast amounts of clean power, not fossil fuel power, to Europe when it needs it. It would be clean power from the west to Europe, rather than dirty, carbon-intensive power from the east.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> My colleague, Deputy Higgins, was correct earlier when she outlined the scale of the opportunity and said that we must accelerate it. Unlike other Deputies across the House who spoke in this debate, I believe we can realise this opportunity quickly. We have no need to rely on building new fossil fuel infrastructure or nuclear energy. Whether it is LNG infrastructure or nuclear energy, those projects will take ten or 15 years to develop. We do not have that time. We can build up our renewable resources in that timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy, which is probably a first for me in this House. He made the crucial point quite clearly that demand management should be a critical area of energy policy. We certainly will not agree on most issues, but if we do not invest heavily in demand management, we will essentially waste energy, be it fossil fuel or renewable. I am delighted that the national retrofit plan will be launched next Tuesday and that it will contain a series of measures to address the demand management angle.</p>

          <p eId="para_888">Struggling workers and their families have had enough of token gestures. They have been insulted by an offer of a trip to Leinster House and there have been mixed messages about the pandemic bonus payment. The Government must ensure family carers, workers in organisations funded under sections 38 and 39 and workers in homeless services funded under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> Sinn Féin will support the Bill, although it has tabled amendments. Much more needs to be done to address energy price hikes and the crippling cost of living. The Government's budget package did not go far enough. There are families in extreme poverty and they are being failed by the Government. It would be worse only for the assistance of charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. Sinn Féin has tabled a number of amendments for consideration on Committee Stage next week. We are concerned that the Bill is drafted in such a way as to permit only a single one-off payment. We have tabled amendments to change this and to give the Minister power to make further payments to households, removing the need for more rushed emergency legislation in the future and ensuring it can be delivered to desperate families as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> Another weakness in the Bill is the universal aspect of this payment, which will see people who do not need financial help receive it while others who need more financial help will not get anything extra. Payments such as this should be targeted. One of our amendments would include a provision for those who do not need the payment to have the option of surrendering it to a charity that supports and helps those living in energy poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> We believe the owners of holiday homes should not benefit from this legislation. We must ensure the payment goes to renters rather than the landlord, in whose name the account may be. There must be a dispute-resolution mechanism to resolve any disputes between renters and their landlords or property management companies over the electricity costs emergency benefit payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> Sinn Féin also calls for a report on the scheduled carbon tax increase in May. Now is the time to scrap it. The Minister must engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on the levels of need for assistance with heating and electricity costs that are currently being experienced to ascertain the need for a discretionary fund to assist those in utility debt. The Government must establish an expert advisory group on energy poverty to design an appropriate way to measure and track energy poverty levels in Ireland. The cost of living has reached an unbearable level for many people, and the €100 credit for energy bills is coming very late.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Finally, it must be said that there have been many announcements with regard to the microgeneration support scheme. It will benefit those lucky enough to have renewable energy technology, but it has been announced so many times that it feels like Groundhog Day. Ironically, that was yesterday. It is time to stop pussy-footing around. The Minister of State is supposed to be a Green Party Minister of State and it is time he acted like one.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">I will keep to my time as I must head back to west Cork afterwards. This Bill amounts to nothing more than tokenism. It is much too little and is way too late. It will have little to no impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group have been calling on the Government to act on crippling energy price hikes for more than a year. Earlier this week the Central Bank announced that it is now forecasting that inflation will surge again this year. It went on to single out energy prices as the main cause. The remarks of the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Gabriel Makhlouf, are even more worrying. He described the surge in costs here as "spectacular". The Government cannot conveniently ignore this research, as the Central Bank analysis clearly shows that those living in lower-income households will be disproportionately affected and will feel the pinch more this year. Overall, the spectacular cost-of-living increases we are experiencing in Ireland mean that an average family will be forced to pay an extra €3,000 to €5,000 to run their household this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> Despite this crisis, all the Government can do is offer a €100 electricity voucher. Not only is this grossly insufficient, it is also an insult. It clearly underlines how out of touch this Administration is with the realities facing families across the country. The truth of the matter is that people cannot afford to heat their homes. That is the bottom line. The price of home heating oil has shot through the roof, as has the price of coal and imported peat briquettes. The Green Party would like us all to wrap ourselves in silver wrap. It sounds mad, and it is, but that is what is happening in homes around Ireland. People cannot afford to heat their homes in 2022. They cannot afford to put fuel in their cars. Again, I am aware that the Green Party would like us all to cycle to work or use public transport. However, in my constituency of Cork South-West people cannot cycle on the roads as there are no cycleways. Even if there were, the hedges and ditches are spilling out onto the roads, making it impossible to cycle on many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> We do not have public transport. In my area of Goleen, the bus leaves at 7.30 in the morning and that is it. It returns in the evening at approximately 6 p.m. That is some public transport system to be proud of, and I will talk about that later. It is not like in Dublin, where beautiful electric buses were purchased recently. However, there is a great plan to reintroduce the train to west Cork. It was announced in the past week. There was a train route to Schull in the late 1800s. Today, we cannot get a train into west Cork because it only goes as far as Cork city. This is a fantastic plan but, as with all plans that require money to be put into west Cork, I am sure it will be abandoned and shelved quite quickly by this Government, which has its mind set on using the finances of the State to keep building and pumping money into the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> In 2017, I pleaded with the then Government to consider bringing light rail to Bandon. The proposal would actually take it back to where there was a rail line previously, down to Skibbereen, Bantry and the like. That is the recent proposal. Surely it could have been examined at that time and the Government could have considered taking light rail there to at least open west Cork as a place of business. A couple of years later, I put another proposal to the Government to establish a park-and-ride system to take cars off the roads. The idea was to have a base in Clonakilty or Skibbereen where people could park their cars and buses running continuously would take them to the city and home again in the evening. Everybody told me it was a great idea, but it was shelved straightaway because it was west Cork and it needed a little investment and a little time.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> The sad thing is that then somebody did capture that great idea. West Cork Connect, Damien Long's bus service, is a private operator. He is running a service to Cork several times a day from Skibbereen and Bantry, taking in Clonakilty, Bandon, Dunmanway and Ballineen.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">He is basically a private operator. I am not here to promote any private operator but he is the only one doing it. Bus Éireann cannot provide this service. He wants to run a new service from Goleen every hour on the hour. The Department will not allow him to do so. He is not asking for money; he is asking for a licence so that he can give people an alternative to using their private vehicles and get those vehicles off the road. For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Department has not sat him down at a table, told him it is a great idea that will save the State thousands or millions of euro and agreed to work to give him some bit of a subvention to allow him to continue. It will not do so. We are trying to find a way forward so that people do not have to use their cars. I refer to the cost of using a car, as well as the other bills people have coming into their homes. This is a fabulous idea. It would be a service every hour on the hour from Skibbereen and Goleen in west Cork. If we cannot see that it is a workable plan that would not cost the State anything, then there is something seriously wrong with the way we are doing business in here.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> I refer to the carbon tax. I do not know why a lot of the Deputies from Opposition parties are shouting. Sure they all voted for the carbon tax. What did they think would happen? Did they think they were going to get a Christmas present from the people of Ireland? They took money out of people's pockets. That is what they did by voting for it. They blindly supported the carbon tax. What do we find out now? The Government is buying beautiful fancy electric buses above in Dublin with the money. Rural Ireland is being punished with the carbon tax. I have said often enough that we cannot carry Dublin on our back; we can only look after ourselves to the best of our ability. The money from the carbon tax is being pushed into pet projects to get them across the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> We do not have a proper road network in west Cork. We have shocking public transport. I will not even mention trains; they do not exist in west Cork. I have every right to stand here and be angry. There is a new plan out there for a public transport service out of west Cork but it is looking for submissions and it is hoped to have it up and running in five years or so. This is what has been going on recently. There have been announcements in respect of west Cork every day of the week for the past two or three months but they are all kicking the can down the road and promising it will happen in five or ten years' time. There is nothing happening on the ground now. We want shovels turning now on projects so that we can deliver for the people of west Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> There will be announcements next week in respect of the warmer homes scheme. Any announcement on that must be welcomed because I have had people come back to my constituency office who think I codded them. I filled out forms for them for the warmer homes scheme two years ago. They were eligible for it at that stage. Now they have come back to my office two years later because they still have not got it and to ask me why I promoted it. We had a fabulous scheme in Bantry several years ago that insulated the homes of the elderly. The roofs and whatever else were insulated. We were able to get into every home and get it sorted within our community. Mother of God, we now are in a situation where the Government cannot deliver on a warmer homes project. Basically, people have to stay at home and cover themselves in a bit of silver wrap and plenty of blankets because they cannot fill the fuel tank since the Government made sure to put home heating oil out of their price range but it will not deliver on the warmer homes scheme. Is it going to have another fancy announcement next week with glossy magazines and praise and everyone patting themselves on the back? I will wait and see if there is delivery. Surely to God, if a person fills out an application form and sends it away, then a date should be scheduled within two or three months for when work should commence. That is the real world we should be living in. Unfortunately, we are living in some la-la land. The Government continually makes announcements but there is nothing happening on the ground. There is no delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> Fuel allowance is an issue. I know loads of people who fall between the cracks and cannot qualify for fuel allowance. It is terribly unfortunate for them. They are in very difficult financial positions and that has to be looked at further. A person who wants to avail of a warmer homes project could be €10 over the weekly income limit. It is terrible to think that person would be omitted as a result, in spite of his or her home desperately needing to be insulated or to have whatever other work done. I am not taking away from the fabulous work that is done under the warmer homes scheme. I know Finbarr O'Sullivan, Con O'Sullivan and others are doing some fabulous work in west Cork. I am not taking away from the work that needs to be done but it needs to be delivered quickly. There are families that are suffering severely at the moment. The finances are not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> I refer to wind and solar energy. The Minister of State talked about wind energy and that is fine. Wind energy is the future, but it should have been the future the last time the Green Party was in government. All this should have been put in place and should be standing there now. I know what is going to happen. The Government will put it in place and tell us we will feed Europe and then it will do the same as it did with fishermen's rights - it will sell them all and give them to the rest of Europe and we will end up with no profit and probably little of the wind energy delivery on this side of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> I was speaking to a person today who was able to buy fuel for his or her bus two years ago at €1.08. It is now costs €1.65. The person will not be able to provide a bus service if this continues. Two years ago, AdBlue cost €440 for 1,000 l but now it costs €750.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">Last November, I came to Dublin with truckers and farmers to show unity on the rising cost of fuel. I asked the Government and every Opposition Deputy to come with me and to make one change that would have made a difference for every household, whether they have a car or not. It would have made a difference for every household and every person in the country. If the Government had frozen the tax on the increase in the cost of fuel coming into this country, it would have had €8 billion to play with. What would that have meant? It would have meant a difference of approximately €40 per week for every household. It would have saved on the energy cost of getting food to the shops. It would have saved on the cost of producing food. It would have saved on the cost of people going to work. It was a short-term solution to a long-term problem. Yes, we have a problem, but I was giving a solution for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> Yesterday, people were suffering. Today, people are suffering. Tomorrow, people will be suffering. I asked for a short-term solution. I wanted a freeze in the tax on the increase in fuel costs for six months. That would have benefited every person in the country. No matter whether people were bringing their child to the childminder's or doing anything else, it would have helped.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> What is the Government's answer to this? It is to give people €100 off their ESB bill. The first thing I will do if I get €100 off my ESB bill is to give it to the first person who needs it more than I do. I am and always have been involved in a lot of charity work. I am always grateful for what I have and my health so that I am able to help others. It sickens me to look around a room and see people I asked for help when I gave the Government a short-term solution to a long-term problem but it did not listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> I will give the Minister some facts. The State pension is €13,100 per annum. A person working full time on the minimum wage gets €21,840 per annum. Recent research by the Central Bank states that the rising costs in Ireland are spectacular and will drive the cost of living up by between €3,000 and €5,000 per annum. Why does the Government think that a €100 electricity voucher is good enough? The national average wage is €23,675 per annum. In classification terms, this means that social welfare payments and the State pension are well below the cost of living. If housing costs are added in, more than 1 million people are at risk of poverty. I do not have a third level education but I know that means 20% of the people in Ireland are going to suffer poverty as a result of the Government failing to listen. I might only have a minimum second level education but I can work it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> I and everybody else in this country can work it out but the Government will not listen. This is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. I asked for a six-month reduction period and the Government would have had €8 billion of a saving. What did the Government do? Costs went up. The price in January 2022 for natural gas is €90 per MWh. The price in 2021 was €19 per MWh. That is a €71 per MWh increase in one year. Small businesses are crippled with the costs which have gone up by 300%.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> All the Government can come up with then is a measly voucher for €100 to help people. It could have put €40 per week into every household in this country when they really needed it and, not only that, but it would have reduced their shopping bills because it would have cost less money to produce that shopping and would have given something back automatically to the people. The Government has it within its control to do that. Its answer to the cost of fuel crisis was that it was going to reduce the National Oil Reserve Agency, NORA, cost by 1%. It will take five months to reduce that. That is the Government's answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> What does the Government get when the price of fuel or anything goes up? It gets more tax and VAT. If one earns more, one pays more. That is the rule. So while everyone in this country is suffering and in poverty and trying to survive, the Government is taking more tax. The Government then talks about the rising wage costs, which would be welcomed by everyone, but the problem is that all of the SMEs in this country are crippled. The multinationals are able to afford this but the SMEs would be in bigger trouble because the Government did not listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> The farmers, who are putting the bread and milk on our tables are subject to more legislation, regulation and more costs. The Government seems to think that things arrive on the shelves just like that. This country represents one tenth of 1% of global emissions and it is the same sky that is over the whole world. We are importing from countries that represent 30% to 40% to 50% of these global emissions. The Government is watching everyone in this country suffer. Everyone suffers. </p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Europe gave the Government the toolbox with which it could have done something. It could have reduced taxes like every other European country has done but the Government would not listen to a person like me. Does it think that I am not qualified enough to tell it what is going on? The reason I am qualified enough is because I am on the ground with people in Ireland. I understand what it means for people outside of the capital to have a life. People within the capital and on the outskirts of Dublin are suffering but the Government lacks the understanding of its remit, which is that it could hold a meeting tomorrow morning and have Cabinet agreement that it would reduce the tax intake on fuel. </p>
          <p eId="para_918"> I am only asking that this would happen on the increase, which is the €8 billion it has taken off every person in this country, whether working or not. That is what this meant. I am still asking and looking for this support, for it to cap its tax intake and take it back to the 2020 prices. It can still take its tax because I know that the Government has to have tax to run a country but I also know that it does not need to tax the increase. Then, at least, if fuel prices go up, we will pay the increase in the fuel costs but we will not be paying €58 in every €100 in tax. Why not take €45 and put €23 or €24 back into the pockets of everyone on every €100 worth of fuel, which is in the Government's control.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> As I said earlier, I may not have had third level education but I have the education of life. Life will tell me that this Government will get an answer when it comes to its turn. I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">Gabhaim buíochas. Everyone here accepts that there is an absolute crisis here in the cost of living. We have all engaged with people and realise what they are going through. We have all seen the prices that are going through the roof whether it is people buying their regular weekly shopping, at the fuel pump, or home heating oil. It does not matter because prices are just going through the roof. We know that there are many reasons for that and that the Government does not have full control over it. We know that there are inflationary impacts on us that we cannot completely control. We know that we have issues in respect of supply chains which relate to Covid-19 and to Brexit. We note that there are very significant geopolitical problems and considerations at this point in time with Russian gas. The EU Toolkit was in place since October and there are things that we can and need to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> We are also hampered in this State because we are living with some of our primary sins in the cost of housing, rentals in particular, and childcare. Until we address them, we will not be dealing some of the vast issues we have with poverty and the pain that people are going through at this point in time. </p>
          <p eId="para_923"> We have some sort of solution here with the €100 and many people will be very glad to get it. Even in respect of this piece of legislation, we need to allow for flexibility. We have amendments in there. There are differences in Government, or at least we are led to believe from leaks from parliamentary party meetings that that is the case. We have to allow that this will not cut it and that there may be a need for a further amount at a later stage. This is about mitigating the pain that is out there. This is no different from what happened during the Covid-19 pandemic period, which is about the State stepping up to the mark. We have to give full facility to be able to deliver that. </p>
          <p eId="para_924"> I accept that there are difficulties in targeting this and aiming it at those who need it. I am not going to say that everyone around here does not need it because we all know that that is the case. We all know that it can be difficult to specifically target something. That is an issue we need to deal with in the systems, including database systems, at later stages and times so that we will have those options open to us. Hopefully, we will not need them as much as we need it at this point in time. </p>
          <p eId="para_925"> There are things we can do, however. We need to look at home heating, fuel, excise and VAT and to really say that we cannot afford to add any increases in carbon tax. That is not to get into the argument on carbon taxes but is in respect of the point we find ourselves now. We have to look at what we can do in not double-paying, on holiday homes and to ensure that we can put in whatever facility for people to surrender. We need to have a conversation with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. There needs to be a discretionary fund. We are all reliant on community organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community and Save Our Homeless Dundalk, where there are many people doing great work. It is not, however, enough as the State needs to step up to the mark and it needs to offer whatever mitigations it can. We need to do it. It is not good enough. Gabhaim buíochas.</p>

          <p eId="para_927">I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Many people are being impacted by the sharp increase in the cost of living. The people who will be most affected by this cost-of-living crisis will be the 630,000 people living below the poverty line which, scandalously, includes 165,000 children and low-paid workers. These are the individuals and families faced with the stark choice to eat or heat. The Government must respond with much more than €113 off our electricity bills. Electricity has risen by 22.4% in cost but gas bills have increased by 27%, and oil heating is up by 53%. The weekly family shop has increased by an estimated €15 a week. A range of measures are needed which should be targeted at those most in need of help. The Government must look at measures adopted in other EU states, such as reductions in carbon taxes and VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The €5 increase in the basic weekly welfare rates in the budget did not even compensate for the fact that there had been no increase in the previous two budgets. In effect, it was a cut. The situation must now be immediately rectified with at least another €5 increase. Even with such measures, many will still struggle to make ends meet. A targeted response, aimed at those who are most in need, must be an urgent priority. The €160 million to fund the €100 off electricity bills should be matched as part of an emergency fund to help meet exceptional payments. Such a fund could be delivered by community welfare officers based in the community, as they were during the 1980s. This could really assist individuals and families who are struggling. For some reason, a number of years ago community welfare officers were withdrawn from the communities they worked in. They should be relocated back into the communities, armed with a special fund to meet exceptional needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> Part of this emergency response must also be a national information campaign to inform those people who are struggling of the various options available to them. For example, do people know that they can engage with their energy supplier if they fear being cut off, and if they make an arrears repayment plan or pay-as-you-go arrangement they cannot be cut off? Do people know that if they register with their supplier as having exceptional needs they cannot be cut off in the winter time? Do people know that they can apply to a community welfare officer for an exceptional payment?</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> Before I conclude I wish to raise a point about the fuel allowance. I raised this with the Minister last year. The so-called increase in the fuel allowance of last year brought it up to €33 per week. I have calculated that this would put €900 into people's pockets over the 28 weeks. Mr. Daragh Cassidy of the price comparison website<i> bonkers.ie</i> has said that some suppliers have announced price hikes that will add up to €800 to energy bills. That was at the end of last year and we know there will be more energy price hikes. In effect, the fuel allowance is paying for the price hikes in fossil fuels. The people who receive the allowance are getting the money to pay for the price increases but will still have to find the money out of their own income for the basic cost of their fuel expenditure. The increase will not really benefit them in any way. The fuel allowance should be increased, it should be expanded to all social welfare recipients, and the means test should be removed. I urge the Government to consider these suggestions as an urgent response to this crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_932">I welcome that the Government is acknowledging that spiralling energy costs will have a very detrimental effect on households across the State. They will have an equally detrimental effect on many businesses across the State and this is not being adequately addressed at all by this measure. I am not suggesting that only businesses should be helped to deal with this issue, but they do also need help with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> This is just one facet of the inflationary times we are living in. I raised this some time ago. For me it is an obvious consequence of the pandemic. I would not blame anybody for the pandemic but, equally, it is considerably exacerbated by government responses to the pandemic across the world. Very few government responses have been as exaggerated and hysterical as the response of our Government. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, did not determine this response in any way, but he happens to be sitting in that seat right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> On the issue of longer term energy security, I have heard a lot of what I would consider aspirational from the Government benches, including Deputy Leddin from Limerick, with whom I would sometimes find myself in agreement. I agree and I greatly look forward to the day when Ireland is providing a huge amount of energy to other countries, and we are self-sufficient in energy. We are not there now, however, and we are not going to be there next month or next year. We are finally accepting now that we are going to have an energy crisis next month and an energy crisis next year, and that we will have a crisis about inflation next month and next year. We are hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> I represent the constituency of Clare. Clare has a long and very proud history of producing energy for the State, in the form of the Shannon scheme at Ardnacrusha, which was hugely innovative when it was developed. It was one of the biggest, if not the biggest, hydroelectric stations in Europe when it was developed. Equally, Moneypoint was also developed in Clare. The two arcs of transmission that go from Moneypoint to Dublin simply could not be built now because they are pylons and we all know there is a lot of controversy around pylons with planning issues, and rightly so. However, they are there, and they are a hugely important piece of infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> Like Deputy Leddin and many other Deputies who have spoken, I greatly look forward to the days when we are bringing onshore energy from off the west coast of Ireland. We do not, however, have it now. I have spoken to people who are intimately involved in advancing this and trying to develop the potential to bring it onshore. We simply do not have the technology now to generate electricity off the west coast of Ireland. Yes the technology exists for offshore energy, but this is for anchored turbines that are probably suited for construction in the Irish Sea. If one is looking at constructing turbines off the west coast of Ireland it is a very different matter. There are huge Atlantic storms. I do not know if the Minister of State has ever experienced an Atlantic storm or the aftermath of one. I recall the former Ministers of State Andrew Doyle and Deputy Ó Cuív, who previously sat in that seat. We went to the Aran Islands once in the immediate aftermath of such a storm. It is quite a sight to behold.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> We cannot take it for granted that we are going to have the technology to harness that energy, given the huge pressures that are put on during Atlantic storms, or that we will have the technology immediately. Yes, everybody is hopeful and everybody is confident that it can be developed, but it is not there yet. Given that the technology is not there yet, why on earth are we powering down Moneypoint now? I am very proud of Clare's history in generating energy, but I am not proud that Moneypoint is belching out noxious gases into the environment. I am not at all proud of that and I greatly look forward to the day when it is replaced with clean energy, as I am sure the Minister of State is too. However, I accept the reality that it is not going to be today, it is not going to be tomorrow, it is not going to be next month or next year, and that we are going to need energy during all of those times and especially when the wind is not blowing. We also must power the incubators, the hospitals and industries when the wind is not blowing. The advantage that Moneypoint will have, hopefully, is that with hydrogen technology we will be able to bring the energy onshore, and there will be huge, vast amounts of energy that we can turn into hydrogen and store in the form of hydrogen. I welcome all of that as much as the Minister of State does.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> I know that the Minister of State welcomes it but what are we going to do now other than give householders €100? With the greatest respect, what the Government is proposing is like a fart in a hurricane. It is utterly irrelevant to the scale of the problem that faces us. If we are going to accept that we are importing energy then we must accept that we are going to import coal-generated energy and nuclear-generated energy. I do not have the problem with nuclear energy that has been enunciated by some Deputies in this Chamber. If I did I would not turn the light on in the morning. Nuclear energy is coming into the Irish grid as we speak and has been for some time. I am sure it will be coming in for some time into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> I do have a problem with coal-powered energy and I look forward to the day it is replaced. I live in the real world, however, where it is not being replaced today and it will not be replaced tomorrow. Instead of generating such energy here in Ireland and instead of having some degree of energy security in the State, we are at the mercy of other states. Some of those states are close and friendly states, we hope, but others are further away, and may be regarded as faraway places of which we know little. They may take a similar view of us, or they may not. It beggars belief that in the face of an energy crisis we are powering down power stations in Ireland and importing exactly the type of energy they are producing.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">I cannot emphasise enough that we are not enemies on this. I am not opposing the green vision for the future. I welcome it and wish it had been done ten years ago, as does the Minister of State, where the technology exists. The technology to generate offshore energy where the turbines are anchored is around for some time now. There is nothing particularly novel about it. There is no reason we could not have more offshore energy in Ireland. We are talking about offshore energy primarily from the Irish Sea, which is going to bring objections as well because it will have to be closer to shore than the type of offshore energy we are talking about off the west coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> We need to be realistic. The technology we are relying on to power our State is not there yet. There is an expression in many parts of Ireland - I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of it - "live, horse, and you'll get grass". That is what we are doing with regard to energy. It is simply not good enough. There is a lot of hyperbole going about, celebrating 100 years of the State. One of the first priorities was to power this nation. If we cannot power this nation ourselves, really we have no degree of independence or self-sufficiency and we have utterly failed. It seems to me the failure continues in both the aspirational approach - aspirations I agree with but we have to deal with here and now as well as how we transition to something better - and in the failure to have a larger energy debate. No matter how much wind energy we bring in, and I am hopeful the technology around converting energy into hydrogen might be the solution, we really have to look at alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> A woman came into my constituency clinic who was objecting to a wind farm. I do not object to wind farms <i>per se</i> but I am very concerned when they are built at a height. I live close to Slieve Aughty and I know what happened in Derrybrien. It was an absolute disgrace. The only thing that was worse than it was the State's response. It had to be brought kicking and screaming to the European Court of Justice - twice, I believe. The situation has never been remedied. Now we are proposing to do something similar. We had a recent landslide in Leitrim and we are proposing to build other wind farms at a height. Absolutely there is a place for wind energy. I asked this woman who was opposed to wind farms what she thought of coal generation. She said it was awful. I asked her about nuclear; she said it was even worse. I asked her what was the first thing she did that morning and she said she turned on the electricity. I asked her where on earth she thought her electricity comes from. I was not re-elected possibly as a result of comments like that but I stand over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> I know it is a glib point to make but we do need power. It is going to come from somewhere. No more than talking about data centres, as long as they are not in Ireland they are not a problem. We have to be real. We have to have energy. We have to have the least environmentally damaging type of energy possible as soon as possible. In the interim, we have to be secure and we have to have energy security. We do not have it and I do not see any sign of addressing it. That is a massive concern to me.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_944">I thank all Deputies for their insightful comments on this emergency legislation. It is emergency legislation. We are trying to address an immediate problem within this quarter and get money into people's accounts. We are in winter. A large number of aspects of this problem were touched on by different Deputies. The problem of energy poverty was raised by many. I thank Deputy Joan Collins for talking about that so eloquently. Deputy McNamara referred to the longer term issue of energy generation. When we are faced with a big problem, we have to tackle both. We have a short-term energy crisis. We have people who are cold in their homes and cannot afford to pay their bills. We also have a longer term and a medium-term problem. All of those things need to be tackled. None of the solutions will be ideal or attractive to everybody. I appreciate the Deputy's comments and I appreciate the widespread support from Deputies from all parties that we should do this, even if there are other things we should do as well. My ears and mind were open to the suggestions that were made. I thank the Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> There was a broad range of contributions, including on renewables, the cost of living, and the role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities. I am going to keep my comments focused on this Bill. My overarching message today is that while the scheme this Bill will establish is just one of a suite of measures, it is critical it is put in place within this quarter. I seek the support of the House to achieve that. It is a matter of serious concern to Government that recent electricity and gas increases caused by international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, especially those in a more vulnerable economic position. I appreciate the important points Deputies have made on the pressure being felt by many households with the rise in the cost of living. It is important to see this Bill as one of a suite of measures. It is not just that there is €100 and nothing else. A broad range of measures are being taken by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> Before the previous budget and the budget before that, lengthy time was spent trying to make sure energy poverty was addressed. In the face of the changes in the carbon taxation structure, we have to be aware people are not being punished who do not have an alternative. The important points on the need to act on energy poverty will, I believe, be best moved forward in the forthcoming revision of the strategy to combat energy poverty. This will be in addition to the €109 million that has been allocated to energy efficiency upgrades and the €146 million projected to be spent on social protection measures in 2022. Alleviating energy poverty will also be a key priority in the forthcoming national retrofit framework. I welcome the support voiced for continuing to drive the long-term solutions to volatile energy markets represented by energy efficiency and renewable generation, and ensuring we grasp the real benefits of a just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> The Government is determined to act quickly to help people further with these higher energy prices. It is worthwhile to restate the purpose of the Bill as well as the operation of the emergency measure. The Bill provides the establishment of a scheme for the purpose of making the electricity cost emergency benefit payment of €100 in 2022. The moneys for the scheme will be allocated by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The amount will not exceed €215 million and will be for the purpose of making a once-off €100 payment by suppliers to each domestic electricity account held by them. This is on the basis of there being approximately 2.15 million domestic electricity account holders as indicated by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU. The CRU will provide oversight of the scheme and it will be operated by the distribution system operator, ESB Networks.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> The mechanism by which the scheme will operate is as follows. The Minister will provide under regulations for a date, to be known as the relevant date, on which the distribution system operator will calculate the total number of domestic electricity accounts in the State on the basis of MPRNs. The MPRN is the unique identifier for all accounts and as such must be used to ensure the €100 payment reaches each account. ESB Networks will notify me of this number and this will allow the calculation of the necessary allocation of moneys for the scheme. On the effective date, which will also be set out by me in regulations, ESB Networks will notify each electricity supplier of the assigned MPRN for each domestic electricity account it supplies and ESB Networks will, on the effective date, notify suppliers of the amount of money it will transfer to them for the purposes of the scheme. I will set out in regulations the period within which ESB Networks will transfer the funds to suppliers for the sole purpose of making payments under the scheme and, following receipt of these funds, suppliers will, within the period prescribed by me under regulations, credit each domestic electricity account held with it on the effective date with a payment of €100.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> The CRU as independent regulator will have oversight of the scheme. It will put in place administrative and operational arrangements to ensure ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the scheme. As is standard practice, the CRU will report to me in respect of the performance of ESB Networks and suppliers of their functions under the scheme. The CRU, on the basis of its existing powers to issue directions and secure compliance by licence holders with their obligations, will ensure ESB Networks and suppliers perform their functions under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> Under the Bill, I shall appoint an auditor and ESB Networks and suppliers will be required to make available to the auditor all books and records relating to the performance of their functions under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Suppliers and ESB Networks are required to repay any moneys received by them which have not been used for the purposes of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> I turn to prepay, which some Members mentioned. Prepay is often associated with people who are in energy poverty. It is essential that the scheme will apply to all domestic electricity account holders, including pay-as-you-go customers. The payment will apply on a once-off, emergency basis, as has been approved by the Government. It is, however, one of a suite of near- and medium-term measures. The total allocation of €215 million is on the basis of a payment of €100 being made to each account. It is standard practice to specify in legislation the maximum amount of Oireachtas funds which can be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> As for tenants in rental accommodation, my Department, with the support of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is working closely with the RTB to ensure that those in rented accommodation who are due the payment receive it. I understand that there are approximately 300,000 tenancies registered with the RTB and that the majority of those tenants either hold their own electricity account or pay their landlord for electricity based on an actual bill and would therefore receive the benefit directly. My Department is working with the RTB on a public information campaign to ensure that any tenants, expected to be a small minority, for whom electricity costs are not separate from overall rental costs are aware of the scheme and of their entitlements. In that context, should any dispute arise between a tenant and his or her landlord, there are existing dispute resolution mechanisms provided by the RTB.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The scheme can become operational only following the passing of this underpinning legislation. As Deputies will appreciate, this emergency measures Bill aims to ensure that the credit can be made to domestic electricity account holders as soon as possible. The scheme will apply to every domestic electricity account holder using his or her unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills. This does not mean that premises other than principal residences, such as holiday homes with a domestic electricity account, will be included in the scheme. The scheme uses the above single eligibility criteria to enable payments to be made at the earliest possible opportunity in 2022. The scheme does not have additional eligibility criteria. For example, it is not means-tested as the application of such criteria would override the automatic nature of the current scheme and would require input from customers through formal applications and cross-checking by administrators, which would significantly delay the roll-out of the payments. Therefore, the automatic crediting of all residential customer accounts is the most effective immediate-term methodology. The CRU has advised that to implement the scheme in the timeframe required, suppliers will use existing billing systems to process the credit. Payments will be credited to domestic electricity accounts. This is why the function is conferred on suppliers, as this is the existing infrastructure which applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> The CRU has considered the question of an opt-out for people who do not wish to receive the payment; however, the scale of work required on the billing system would be of an order that would significantly delay the issue of this payment to all electricity users. While I appreciate people's views on this, I also feel it is important to move ahead with administering the scheme in order that people receive their payments as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> The scheme is in addition to the Government's primary response to rising energy prices, which is to use the tax and social welfare systems to counter rising costs of living, of which energy costs are one of the biggest drivers. Further consideration to tackle increases in the cost of living is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> As for people who are in energy poverty, targeted intervention is required. Such action is already being taken through the social welfare system. In budget 2022 we increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by €5 to €32 a week. There were increases to the qualified child payment, the living-alone allowance and the income threshold for the working family payment. The total cost of these interventions is projected at €146 million in 2022. This will be funded by additional carbon tax funds of €105 million that have been allocated to the Department of Social Protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_964">I am very glad to see a Minister taking a slot on a Thursday evening. The graveyard slot, I think, is what people call it.</p>
            <p eId="para_965"> This is an incredibly important issue. As with an awful lot of issues relating to Northern Ireland politics at this time, it is nearly a different question we need to ask since the Topical Issue matter was submitted. What Edwin Poots has done as Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in ordering an end to agrichecks is obviously a complete breach. From what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said earlier and what other commentators have stated, those checks are still ongoing and Edwin Poots may have jumped ahead of any legal checks that should have been carried out, but that is nothing shocking for him, given the chaos he finds himself in politically and the chaos his political party is in.</p>
            <p eId="para_966"> We need it affirmed that there is absolutely no doubt but that the withdrawal agreement and the Irish protocol are there to stay. It is an international agreement and there is an absolute requirement on the British Government to ensure that it stays. None of us has been particularly happy with some of the commentary to the effect that this relates to the Executive. I do not know where that sits at the moment in the sense that the Executive no longer exists because Paul Givan was told by Jeffrey Donaldson to resign his post and that is done. We know there is legislation being brought through that probably gives us an element of breathing time, but the fact is that Deputy McDonald has already said there should be an election. That is one thing. We need to make sure there is absolute clarity at European level, at Irish Government level and across the board that the Irish protocol is here to stay and that the British Government has an absolute requirement to ensure that. The British Government has failed because many times it has given succour to a unionism that has gone down a cul-de-sac.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Kenny<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_967">What Edwin Poots has done as Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in the North is absolutely scandalous and reckless. It flies in the face of international law and is in breach of an international agreement between the European Union and Britain and in breach of the protocol. It is very clear that the DUP, for some very narrow and nationalistic reason of its own, and the Tory Party in Britain have for some time had a hyped-up agenda to do everything they possibly can to destroy the protocol. I even saw the DUP today talk about how the protocol was costing millions of euro per day to businesses in the North. I know that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I and every political party that speaks to businesses in the North and their representatives get a different story. There certainly is not this cost the DUP talks about. Most businesses we talk to and deal with tell us that the protocol has been very good for them because it offers them the opportunity of trade with Britain on one hand and trade with the European Union on the other as well as the freedom from a lot of tariffs. It has been very positive in many ways. There have of course been some minor hitches, but those hitches are very small and can be easily dealt with. What the DUP is doing has therefore nothing to do with protecting the business interests of anyone, north, south, east or west; it is simply to do with its own narrow political agenda. That needs to be spelled out clearly.</p>
            <p eId="para_968"> The British Government needs to be called to book on this and to stand up to unionism to ensure that they do the right thing, that we can move forward and that the protocol is kept in place. It has to be because it is part of an international agreement to which the British Government signed up. Many people are angry. Over recent hours we have seen that the Assembly will now be pulled down and we will have no Assembly in place. Again it is this forward march, particularly, it seems, by the DUP, towards disaster at all costs. It wants to try to create as much chaos as possible. It is totally outside the interests of its own people as well as everyone else on this island. I will give the Minister the opportunity to make very clear the Irish Government's position and the European Union's position on this.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_969">I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue which offers the opportunity to discuss important developments in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_970"> The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part of an international agreement, the EU-UK withdrawal agreement, which was negotiated, agreed and ratified by the British Government and the EU. The protocol was jointly designed by the UK and the EU to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions and to protect the gains of the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_971"> Yesterday's announcement by the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs that he has ordered officials to halt the implementation of post-Brexit sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks under the remit of his Department is deeply unhelpful. It only serves to create further uncertainty for people and businesses in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland's business community has been resolute in its call for certainty, stability and predictability. They have consistently underlined the importance of Northern Ireland's unique dual-market access under the protocol and have done so again today.</p>
            <p eId="para_972"> Furthermore, this afternoon's decision by Paul Givan to resign as First Minister is regrettable and clearly has wider implications for the Northern Ireland Executive and its important work. People in Northern Ireland want to see a positive commitment from everyone to resolve issues, not the creation of new cliff edges, threats and instability. No positive agenda is served by the breakdown of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement - neither the Executive nor of the North-South Ministerial Council, which has also been impacted by the political instability in recent months.</p>
            <p eId="para_973"> The protocol fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as set out in the Good Friday Agreement. That is clear in black and white. Our focus now, as always, will be on working with the political parties and the British Government to support political stability in Northern Ireland and the effective operation and important work of all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_974"> I have been in contact today with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, as I was last night, on these developments and their implications for political stability. I also spoke at length on developments with the European Commission Vice President Maroš Šefčovič this morning before his discussions with the British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, this afternoon. Their talks are progressing and should be given the space and support needed to try to reach accommodation and agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> It is our understanding that, as of today, all relevant SPS checks are continuing to take place as normal and that businesses have been advised to continue to follow customs and SPS rules in full despite what the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Edwin Poots, said last night. The checks required under the protocol are not optional; they have a clear legal basis both in UK domestic law and in international law. Therefore, failure to implement them is a breach of both international and UK domestic legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_976"> The protocol is part of the wider withdrawal agreement and is inextricably linked to the trade and co-operation agreement between the UK and the EU. As one relies on the other, if one is not implemented, it potentially impacts on the viability of the other. This evening, I call on the British Government to uphold the law, stand by its agreements, and provide certainty to the business community and other relevant stakeholders. This will allow Northern Ireland's peace, prosperity and stability to be properly safeguarded.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I am very glad that the Minister finished on the absolute need for the British Government to uphold the law, uphold the agreements it has agreed to and provide clarity. We have all heard it from business people we have spoken to before. Even today the representatives of the retailers and manufacturers have all given commentary. They want clarity and solutions to whatever difficulties they have.</p>
            <p eId="para_978"> I believe Maroš Šefčovič said previously that he would stay at the table. Obviously, Liz Truss was not going to provide what the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, was looking for in the sense of a cliff edge. That probably precipitated some of what happened today. I suppose on some level it is hopeful, but we need to ensure that is maintained. Has the Irish Government received any updates on the legalities of the SPS checks? As they are ongoing, I presume that means that Edwin Poots overshot the mark on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">The issue here seems to be that Edwin Poots went completely outside his remit. He claims to have got independent legal advice outside of his Department, which is quite unusual for any Minister to be claiming as a basis for carrying out such a dastardly deed. I understand the British Government has the option to override a decision made by a Stormont Minister in the circumstances where it is in breach of an international agreement. Have we received anything back from the British Government in respect of what its intentions would be if, following the instruction given by Edwin Poots, officials in the North choose to try to implement that and withdraw these checks? Is there a second option that the British Government could step in and do something about it?</p>
            <p eId="para_980"> On the wider point, I am very concerned that all of this has taken a very bad turn in the last few hours and few days for no apparent reason. It is highly disrespectful to the process in which the European Union and Ms Truss are engaged for the DUP to act this way.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">The message I have from the British Government today is that it is taking legal advice about the options available. I understand that the senior officials who are maintaining checks at ports in Northern Ireland today are also getting legal advice about their obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_982"> Ireland's position on the implementation of the protocol has been consistent. We will continue to work with Vice President Maroš Šefčovič and his team and also with Liz Truss and her team to try to find solutions to outstanding issues through compromise, flexibility and pragmatism over how the protocol is implemented. We must be honest with people and consistent about what the protocol represents. The protocol is part of an international agreement, the withdrawal agreement, as I said earlier, agreed and ratified by the UK and the EU together. It is the result of over four years of difficult negotiations which involved compromises on all sides. It is the one and only solution found to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions in the context of the UK's decision to leave the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> The UK has a clear international obligation to implement the terms of the protocol, including by ensuring that the agreed upon SPS checks are carried out at ports in Northern Ireland. This is not only an international legal obligation. The European Union Withdrawal Agreement Act 2020, enacted by the UK Parliament, gives legal force in UK domestic law to the withdrawal agreement of which the protocol is an integral part. This is British domestic legislation as well as international law in the context of the treaties that have been agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_984"> Together with the European Commission, we will continue to monitor developments in Northern Ireland closely. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the British Government to honour its commitments and to respect its international obligations. This is an important month in the context of the protocol issues. I know there are significant efforts under way, on the EU side and on the British Government side to try to find accommodation on the key issues of customs, SPS and so on by the end of the month. Despite all the politics being played with this issue, we need to ensure that we give the negotiators time and space to try to find accommodation to settle some of these issues in February if we can.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">This is the story of three very important schools in Celbridge, County Kildare. One is St. Raphael's Special School, in respect of which it was determined 20 years ago that it urgently needed replacement. The plans are now advancing, but whether they are advancing fast enough remains to be seen because there were some title issues, some of which are still outstanding. Our colleague has arranged a meeting with the Minister next week, and it is to be hoped some further information will be available at that. In the meantime, we wish to emphasise the absolute urgency of the case. The other two schools are Scoil Naomh Pádraig and Celbridge Community School. There are three schools on the one site.</p>

Without all of those things coming together at the same time, we will not be able to proceed in the way we want to. I hope that all goes well. We have waited for this for a long time. The local community is very anxious and we now call on the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, who cannot be here for reasons that are quite well known at this time of the week, to address this. </p>
            <p eId="para_987"> I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Minister the absolute urgency of the situation. We hope to meet her face-to-face next week, during which time we will raise these matters again. We hope this will bring the bacon home for the people of Celbridge who are anxiously awaiting news.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">This is the second time Deputy Durkan and I have tabled a Topical Issue on this issue. I cannot stress enough how important this is to the three schools concerned, St. Raphael's Special School, Scoil Naomh Pádraig and Celbridge Community School. It is important not just for the schools, but the children who attend and have yet to attend, their families and the entire community.</p>
            <p eId="para_989"> The process has been going on and on with Kildare County Council for the past few years. We have now been told that the county council has finished its involvement in the process. I am sure the Minister of State will understand how anxious we, the schools and the principals are to move with all speed to the commencement date for the building work that needs to take place. It is vitally important that the principals of the three schools are involved because they are the experts. </p>
            <p eId="para_990"> I wrote to the Minister two weeks ago to ask for a meeting and, as Deputy Durkan said, that meeting will take place next week. We appreciate that. It is important that the principals also attend the meeting because they are the experts. We need to move with all haste. Celbridge is a thriving and vibrant town and community, and the three schools need to be built. </p>
            <p eId="para_991"> I have always wondered why there is no proper forward planning in the Department of Education. Maynooth University, in my home town, publishes reports and we know how many children there are in a given area. I do not see why there cannot be some forward planning in the provision of schools. It is good to see us working together on this. The four Deputies in the constituency are anxious about this. I look forward to the response from the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_992">I thank Deputies Durkan and Cronin for providing me with the opportunity to, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, update the House on the position with respect to the acquisition of the three-school campus site in Celbridge, County Kildare, on behalf of the Minister for Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_993"> The construction of new school buildings for St. Raphael's Special School, Celbridge Community School and Scoil Naomh Pádraig are included in the Department of Education's schools building programme. It is intended that the new schools will be located on a site being acquired at Donaghcumper, Celbridge, as part of a campus development. In tandem with the site acquisition, the Department of Education is working on the accommodation briefs for the three schools, which is part of the preparatory work associated with the architectural planning process. The Department is committed to advancing the campus development as quickly as possible and will keep the school advised of progress in this regard. </p>
            <p eId="para_994"> I can confirm that the Department of Education has agreement in principle for the acquisition of a site to accommodate the three-school campus at Donaghcumper, Celbridge, and the acquisition process is at an advanced stage. The Department of Education is currently engaging with developers to finalise the details of the heads of terms, and officials in the Department have worked closely with officials from Kildare County Council regarding this site acquisition. The Department is continuing to actively engage with all stakeholders. Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Department of Education is not in a position to provide any further information at this stage. </p>
            <p eId="para_995"> Deputy Durkan has asked me to convey the urgency of the situation to the Minister, and I will certainly do that. Deputy Cronin spoke about a meeting next week, and I hope the schools will be in a better position after that. It is taking a long time to acquire the site. I hope the meeting next week brings more information and there is better news.</p>

            <p eId="para_996">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Unfortunately, it does not contain any extra news other than what I received in a reply to a parliamentary question about a week ago. However, it presents an opportunity to restate the urgency of the case. The urgency arises from the fact that we have been pursuing this particular objective for quite a number of years. In the case of St. Raphael's, 20 years is a long time. Two or three generations of children have come and gone through the school, and yet it is still awaiting further developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_997"> I hope that a very particular emphasis is put on the need for speed in the case of the provision of the three schools concerned at the earliest opportunity. It would be very important to be able to tell the representatives of the schools' authorities when the Minister meets them next week the exact position and how long the further discussions and negotiations are going to take place. If there are any particular snags, we need to know about them now.</p>

            <p eId="para_998">I would also like to thank the Minister of State for his reply. Unfortunately, there is not much more information in it than the reply I received to my parliamentary question. I appreciate that is the current position. These schools have been through so much, in particular St. Raphael's which is a school for children with special needs and intellectual disabilities. Given the current state of the school, we have to do better.</p>
            <p eId="para_999"> Since I was elected, I have, along with councillors in Celbridge, met the principals of these schools in the evening, and it is important to acknowledge their commitment to their students. They are working out of hours. My mother was a principal and I know, no more than being a Deputy, it is a full-time job. One does not get time off. I would like to acknowledge their commitment to their students and I look forward to the meeting next week. It is to be hoped things can progress with a degree of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1000">I again thank Deputies for raising this matter. On behalf of the Minister, they should rest assured that this project is being given priority attention and we are attempting to bring the matter to a close as soon as possible. I understand significant technical matters crucial to the delivery of the site were identified by the site acquisition team. Each matter requires thorough and complex assessment, in conjunction with Kildare County Council and the landowner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001"> I must emphasise the importance of conducting a thorough appraisal of the site-specific technicalities before proceeding with an acquisition, not only to minimise risk, but also to obtain the best value for money for the Exchequer. The site acquisition process is complex and subject to the completion of a successful negotiation and conveyancing process. I would like to give the Deputies a definite timeframe for the completion of the acquisition, but officials will endeavour to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">It is expected that once legal conveyancing commences, the project to deliver the new school accommodation can simultaneously progress to architectural planning stage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1003">Yesterday marked the centenary of the publication of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>. It is an event that deserves to be commemorated and recognised by this State. Over the past ten years, we have engaged with a lot of commemoration in terms of the important historic political events we have commemorated, including the commemoration of the Irish involvement in the First World War, the Easter Rising of 1916, the meeting of the First Dáil in 1919 and the War of Independence. All of those are commendable, political, military events that deserve to be commemorated. However, we cannot just view the progress of the Irish State in terms of political or military developments. It is very important we recognise the publication of <i>Ulysses</i>, the centenary of which took place yesterday. International commentary on the events I have outlined shows the event that got much more commentary and recognition was the publication of <i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce. Recognition for that goes to Sylvia Beach and Shakespeare and Company in Paris, which published the book in 1922. Let it be clear, that book would not have been published in Ireland. There was great difficulty getting it published anywhere. Ms Beach and Shakespeare and Company deserve recognition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004"> What Joyce delivered was a remarkable literary achievement. The study of <i>Ulysses</i> and the works of James Joyce have gone through an extraordinary transformation over the past 40 to 50 years. Forty to 50 years ago, Joyce was regarded as a bit of an intellectual oddity. That has changed significantly now. We can now see he was one of the great literary figures of the 20th century. Literature probably was the dominant art form in that century and James Joyce was its Michelangelo. We should be extremely proud he was an Irishman and, as I am, extremely proud he was a Dubliner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> We need to note that James Joyce's work is not just of benefit and use for those who are literary scholars. Every year, huge numbers of tourists come to Dublin because they have an interest in James Joyce and his works. We need to recognise where the State is failing in its duty to commemorate and support that memory of James Joyce. There are some events which are protected, including the James Joyce Centre, which a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been instrumental in protecting over the years, and the James Joyce Institute. The State should be doing much more. I will give a couple of examples. I refer to James Joyce House on Usher's Quay, where <i>The Dead</i>, one of his great stories, is based. We seem to be acting as bystanders in looking at that house. We need to recognise it is an important part of Joyce's history and Irish history that deserves to be preserved. In Sandycove, there is the James Joyce Tower, in respect of which the State has played a very limited role. That should be a shrine to James Joyce and we, as a State, should value it immensely. A couple of years ago when I was a member of Dublin City Council we had a huge task of work to ensure Sweny's chemist on Westland Row remained open because of a rates bill that was being imposed on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006"> As a State, we need to do more to commemorate and protect the memory of James Joyce and his literary works. I would be interested to know what the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has planned to ensure that occurs. I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this very topical and interesting issue. As the Deputy will know, the centenary of the publication of<i> Ulysses </i>is arguably one of the most important literary centenaries in the history of the State, and while this year we celebrate the 100th anniversary of a great book about Dublin by, as mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan, a great Dublin writer, it is also a huge moment in international writing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008"> As mentioned by Deputy O'Callaghan, <i>Ulysses</i> offers us many tourism opportunities, with visitors keen to walk the streets of Joyce's rich characters and visit those places made iconic by <i>Ulysses</i>. Our rich literary history allows us to promote a unique tourism offering. Dublin was named the seventh best city in the world to visit in 2022 by Lonely Planet, specifically calling out the centenary as a key reason to plan a visit to Dublin in 2022.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I am pleased to hear that progress is being made in terms of the commemoration of <i>Ulysses</i>. I welcome the detail contained with the reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> It is fair to say James Joyce had a difficult relationship with Ireland. He probably would be surprised that, in a national Parliament, Members are standing up to commemorate the publication of his great book 100 years ago. I do not think he would have envisaged he would have the support and appreciation of the Irish people that is manifested by us all today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011"> We need to look at doing something bigger to commemorate James Joyce. I ask that the Minister of State would bring some of the following ideas to the attention of the Minister with responsibility for culture. They may be good or bad ideas, and if rejected, I do not mind, but we do need to do something significant to commemorate James Joyce. In travelling around the world one passes through Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. My first idea is to change the name of Dublin Airport to James Joyce International Airport. It would give a real indication of the appreciation and value we place on a literary figure. It would also be a slight shift of emphasis from a very dignified, historic past where we commemorate people involved in politics or military struggles.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">There would also be a certain irony in Dublin Airport, a place from where people leave the country, being named after James Joyce.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013"> I will raise a more contentious issue. I will be interested to hear what people like Deputy Durkan think about this. I went to Zurich a couple of years ago with two friends. We got a tram up the mountain to Fluntern Cemetery. The back of it is a lonely place. You go in through a gate and Joyce's grave is at the back of the graveyard. It is a lonely spot and there are very few other graves around his. When he died, Nora Barnacle was interested in having his body brought back to be buried in Ireland. That is something we should give consideration to. It is a contentious issue and people may disagree with it. Joyce has no family descendants alive to object to it, but we as a country need to give recognition and thought to bringing home our most famous child.</p>

            <p eId="para_1014">The Deputy has offered many ideas. As I said, Fáilte Ireland has supported the Bloomsday festival for a number of years. Tourism Ireland has also developed an innovative programme around this particular centenary this year by reaching out to global audiences around the world. As the Deputy said, this momentous centenary is being marked in many different ways, with the support of the Government. Like the Deputy, I look forward to the roll-out of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015"> He said that Joyce had a difficult relationship with Ireland. The number of people who left over past decades indicates that many of them had a very difficult relationship with Ireland as well. I always had a major interest in Tim Pat Coogan's book, <i>Wherever Green is Worn</i>, and the Irish diaspora, be it in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom or the United States. Last night, we saw Celtic, a club I have supported over the years, play Rangers. Celtic's founder, Brother Walfrid, Andrew Kerins, came from Ballymote in my constituency. People like him are equally Irish and feel so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> The idea of James Joyce airport is interesting. We have to look at all the young men and women who have left over the past decades. It could be an idea to remember the people who left through whatever airport, whether it was Knock Airport, Shannon Airport, Cork Airport or Dublin Airport. We must remember that we are in a much better space, but the Deputy's idea is interesting. A James Joyce airport is certainly worthy of consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">It is sometimes very hard to know how to articulate something that I have been campaigning on for almost seven years. Along with others, I have been convinced for a long time of the necessity for Ireland to change its drug policy. I have been working with others in other political parties, movements, lobby groups and community groups to try to get Ireland to change its view of the drug user. In all that, there is now space for us to talk as a country about the treatment we have handed down to those who have used drugs, who use drugs and who are in addiction services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018"> There is a significant misunderstanding of the nature of drug use. We have attempted over the course of the history of the State to shame those who take drugs as much as we possibly can, and to criminalise them in an attempt to get them to stop, but that has been the most catastrophic policy failure on any level. It is an expensive disaster that causes misery, pain and death. The people who are most affected by it are the most vulnerable and powerless in Irish society. When we criminalise people for their addiction or drug use, we are actually criminalising marginalisation and disconnection because, disproportionately, the people who come into the criminal justice system as a result of being caught with something in their possession for their own personal use are from areas of disadvantage, are members of the Travelling community, are migrants or are people with disabilities. They are often people who are self-medicating trauma and pain and are trying to seek a connection. Irish society, the Irish Legislature and this State have decided to criminalise that disconnection and marginalisation in an attempt to correct that individual. It does not work. Some 70% of drug cases in front of the courts concern possession for personal use. It is a complete and utter waste of time, money and energy and it does not work. </p>
            <p eId="para_1019"> We are waiting for the Minister of State. I and others in different parties in this Oireachtas have given him time, space and latitude to step up and be the advocate for a citizens' assembly on drugs. It would be easy for us in the Opposition to dismiss the idea of a citizens' assembly on drugs as being a mere talking shop, but my party and I decided that we had to come from a good and fair place to allow such an assembly to be established and advocate within it for what we are trying to advocate for, which is a radical overhaul of drug policy in Ireland. We are still waiting for the Minister of State and the Government to commit to establishing a citizens' assembly on drugs where we can start a proper national conversation on a failed policy and to replace it with something new. </p>

            <p eId="para_1023">There is a fantastic opportunity for this Oireachtas to achieve something. In recent years, a justice committee report on decriminalisation of drug users received the support of every political party. We passed radical legislation on the provision of an injecting centre. While it has been objected to, it remains law that we can establish an injecting facility in Ireland. That legislation was passed without a single objection from any Member of in this House. No one in these Houses is standing on a war-on-drugs platform or saying we need to have zero tolerance. Every Member of the Oireachtas, from what I can see, is talking about the humane treatment of the person who is addicted to drugs because of the nature of that person's struggle to overcome the reasons he or she got into addiction and the pathway that person needs to get out of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024"> I take great comfort from the Minister of State's answer because he is saying we will have a decision on the citizens' assembly on drugs in the coming weeks. Until this point, I have heard so many reasons we cannot have the citizens' assembly. I understand we have Covid and people want citizens' assemblies on other areas, including biodiversity and education. I understand all that. The problem here is that the people who are most acutely affected by this are probably the most powerless people in the State. There is a sense that their addiction is their own fault and there is a significant level of victim blaming. They are probably the only cohort in this land whom people can use a derogatory term to describe on any radio or television programme at any hour of the day or night and get away with it. This is why this is so important. I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, but can we get movement on this in a short time? Can we have the citizens' assembly established before the summer so that we can at least offer those who feel as if they have no voice a process to begin healing and take a new approach to drug use in Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin for the opportunity to provide an update. As I said, the programme for Government includes a commitment to convene a number of citizens' assemblies, including one to consider matters relating to drug use. The specific timing of future citizens' assemblies will shortly be finalised by the Government. I look forward to those dates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026"> The Government established a working group to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use in December 2017. The work programme of the group consisted of meetings with experts from other countries, commissioning research on other jurisdictions and undertaking a public consultation. The consultation process received responses from over 20,000 people and included the views of many people who use drugs. The working group examined the option of decriminalising drugs and did not deem this as an appropriate option in the Irish context due to legal difficulties which could lead to de facto legalisation of drugs as well as operational problems for An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027"> The Government accepted the views of the working group on the decriminalisation of drugs and, accordingly, there are no plans to decriminalise drugs. In line with this working group's recommendations, the Government agreed a health-led approach to the possession of drugs for personal use in the form of the health diversion programme. I assure the House that we are in step with other EU member states on this issue as the health diversion programme is aligned with the strategic priority in the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025 to provide alternatives to coercive sanctions for people who use drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028"> In budget 2022, I secured an additional €6 million for new measures to support the implementation of the national drugs strategy. This includes €700,000 to commence the implementation of the health diversion programme. It will establish a national network of health screening and brief intervention services for people referred to the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029"> I look forward to the commencement of the health diversion programme which will demonstrate a health-led approach in how we deal with people who use drugs. Deputy Ó Ríordáin is correct. We want to take the stigma out of this issue. The national drugs strategy and the health diversion programme will be a start. I look forward in the coming weeks to the Government and the three party leaders determining a date for a citizens' assembly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1031"> A well-functioning freedom of information regime is essential to any state that considers itself democratic because the fundamental principle that the public have a right to know must prevail. There is no denying or defending the poor track record that this State has when it comes to access to official State information and documentation. Just ask any of the residents who were adopted from a mother and baby home or a journalist. It is an attitude that feeds into this lack of transparency and accountability. When we have a situation where a Minister deletes official correspondence and admits to doing so, or Ministers admitting to using disappearing messaging phone apps, it must be considered that our freedom of information regime is essentially disregarded by those who should know better and those who are in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> We cannot have a situation where Ministers are deleting correspondence or engaging with vested interests with prior agreement to not keep detailed notes. There is not even a passing resemblance of transparency in that, yet it happened. It is one thing to talk about transparency and openness in politics and it is an oft-repeated refrain from members of the Government. However, the irony that seems lost on them is that while they talk about it, they preside over Departments that treat freedom of information, FOI, requests almost as a personal affront.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> The variability in the level of disclosure among Departments is astounding. Decisions to refuse FOI requests returned on appeal are astounding. In some instances, we have been told that information does not exist only for it to be discovered later. Some would call this approach obstructionist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> In a swiftly becoming time-honoured tradition, the Government wants to kick this Bill down the road. It is the same old story. The Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has been calling for increased powers for years yet unfortunately these calls have fallen on the deaf ears of successive Governments. My party's Bill seeks to allow SIPO to investigate those who recklessly and repeatedly fail in their FOI obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> Increased accountability is not a bad thing unless you have something to hide. This Bill will help broaden the current remit of FOI by requiring the Minister to conduct an annual review of public bodies to see whether they need to be brought more fully under FOI's remit. This would allow the Minister to bring public bodies that are only partially under FOI more fully under the Act. It would help to ensure that public bodies act consistently and appropriately when fulfilling their FOI duties. It would also ensure there is no time gap in FOI coverage. Where a company becomes a public body, it would be immediately brought under the Freedom of Information Act. There would be no period of six months' exclusion, as we have seen with the Land Development Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> We need to provide SIPO with the power to investigate those who are failing in their obligations. There is simply no justification in the Government amendment to put this off for nine months. The freedom of information regime is failing and that is recognised, not only in this House but where the impact is felt most, that is, by the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">We can see from the Government amendment that it is, at best, kicking the can down the road by having a Second Reading in nine months and, at worst, shooting this legislation down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> As I have said previously to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, we are here to offer solutions. The Government asks us to offer solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">However, it is fair to say the Government just is not interested in our solutions, even on occasions such as today when we explicitly state that we are willing and happy to work with it. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated yesterday at committee that he judges each and every Bill on its own merits, but he and the Minister of State should also judge each Bill in light of the Stage it is at in the Dáil. We are here on Second Stage of this Bill brought forward by me and Deputy Clarke. If it is allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, we will be able to work on any issues the Ministers have. We could consider amendments and different provisions. We could work together constructively on this and then everyone would be a winner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> The review of the FOI regime was announced by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, back in June. I made a detailed submission on it, trying to be constructive on my end. It should be noted, however, that when the Minister announced the review, he told us the regime was robust and functioning well. Obviously, we then had the likes of Zapponegate, in which it appears that official correspondence was deleted. It was clear the regime was in crisis well before that but at that point it became extremely clear. I will never forget listening to "Morning Ireland" last September and hearing the Tánaiste state the Minister was due to announce a review of the FOI legislation. Of course, he knew the Minister had already announced the review in June of that year. That showed the lack of urgency and understanding of the importance of FOI there was and is at the Cabinet table. We need to put a new and important emphasis on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> We have known the regime has been in crisis for a long time. In 2018, <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the headline, "Freedom of Information: 'Unacceptably high' response-time failures." In 2019, a headline<i>
						</i>on <i>thejournal.ie</i> stated, "The Freedom of Information Act is dead". In February 2020, the month in which I was elected, the top law firm Byrne Wallace published an article entitled, "Is Ireland’s Freedom of Information Act facing an existential crisis". As the Minister of State is aware, I have had quite an interest in FOI for some time. In 2021, I conducted a survey with some of the top investigative journalists and transparency campaigners in the State. The results were undeniable and damning. That surely made it clear to anyone with any lingering doubts that there had been a lack of emphasis on FOI and the FOI regime was in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> We have a real opportunity with this Bill. The ongoing FOI review and the wider review of the ethics framework are important but we need to look at the role FOI will play in improving transparency and accountability. Will it be broadened, deepened and reinvigorated? What role will the Standards in Public Office Commission play in respect of those who are failing in their obligations under the FOI Act? Will it continue to be a body that regularly asks for increased powers but rarely gets them, or will it become a new force for transparency and accountability, as envisioned by the Public Sector Standards Bill which every party in this House supported? Our Bill would empower SIPO to investigate complaints in respect of those who are failing in their FOI duties. I acknowledge that at the committee yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, mentioned concerns regarding how exactly that would happen but I again make the point that it is on Committee Stage that those concerns can be addressed. Let us have those conversations and work together to thrash these things out. That is what committees can and should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> Our Bill would require the Minister to conduct an annual review to ascertain what public bodies need to be brought more fully within the remit of FOI. For example, some public bodies are only partially under FOI. It would also ensure there is no time gap in FOI coverage. As we know, certain bodies do not fall under it for the first six months. That is an issue of concern. Under the Bill, public bodies will come straight under the remit of FOI. The Bill also attempts to bring back within the remit of FOI pension information in respect of retired taoisigh, tánaistí and Ministers. While the Minister also expressed concern in that regard yesterday, we are more than happy to sit down with him and the Minister of State and their officials to listen to their concerns, as would be done if the Bill moved to Committee Stage. We need to allow that to happen. We need to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage because we have a real opportunity here, especially in light of the ongoing FOI review and the review of the ethics frameworks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> I acknowledge the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has a particular interest in this issue and conducted the review in June. However, I am also aware we need quick action on that because not every Minister will always have an interest in FOI. The Minister has such an interest, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, so let us do something about this urgently. Let us act on it now and bring the Bill drafted by me and my colleague to the next Stage in order that we can ensure there are amendments and this is progressed. The review was announced in June, many months ago. What we need now is action on it because it is not something new. Anyone who has had an interest in FOI has known there have been concerns and issues. We need to act on it. As the Minister has carried out extensive engagement on the issue, let us act on it. Let us bring the Bill to Committee Stage and have that conversation and we can work together pragmatically. I would like the Minister of State to refrain from moving the proposed amendment in order that we can bring the Bill to Committee Stage. It is important. We can work together. Is that not what this Chamber is all about - Deputies working together to get good legislation for the benefit of people?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1045">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1046">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1047">"Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1048">— recognises that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is undertaking a comprehensive review of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to strengthen and modernise the legislation; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1049">— resolves that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day nine months, to allow for the review to be completed and for a proposal for draft legislation to take account of recommendations arising from the review to be brought forward."</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">I thank Deputies Clarke and Mairéad Farrell for bringing the Bill forward. They are correct that it is important. This is a good opportunity to discuss it. While I and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, commend the interest the Deputies have taken in the FOI system and will welcome any policy suggestions or proposals in the context of the ongoing review, I respectfully take the view that the Bill has been overtaken by the broader review of the strengths and challenges in the FOI system that is being undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> It is of critical importance that policy development is grounded in a firm evidential base and I will, therefore, take the opportunity to set out some background facts on the operation of the FOI system. Tens of thousands of requests are made annually under the legislation to more than 600 freedom of information bodies. From the introduction of the revised legislation in 2014 to 2019, the number of requests annually almost doubled to approximately 40,000 requests. The level of demand increased by 179% between 2009 and 2019. Even against a backdrop of Covid-related disruption, 32,652 requests were processed in 2020 and it is expected the previous upward trend will resume when figures are collated for 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> In terms of outcomes, the vast majority of FOI requests decided on are granted in full or in part, accounting for approximately four of every five requests in most years. For example, the figure was 81% in 2020. The majority of requests annually are for personal information, with 57% of requests being on that basis in 2020, for example. In cases where requesters are unhappy with the decision they have received, extensive review mechanisms are available. Internal reviews, where a more senior staff member in a body reconsiders the request, are sought for approximately 3% of requests in most years. In 2020, for example, that figure was 3.3%. An independent review by the Information Commissioner is sought in approximately 1% of cases annually. In 2020, it was 1.3% of cases. The role of the commissioner is to determine whether the FOI decision made by a public body was justified. In a review by the commissioner, the onus is on the public body to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the decision was justified. The staff of the commissioner draw on experience and expertise gathered through the years to thoroughly test the arguments put forward by public bodies. The statistics show the commissioner tends to uphold the decision of the public body in the majority of decided cases following a review. For example, this was the outcome in 70% of decided cases in 2020. It is clear the system as it is currently structured is delivering on its own terms, with ever-greater amounts of information being released year on year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Of course, that is not to suggest there are not very legitimate questions as to whether the request-based FOI model that was designed based on the assumption of paper-based administration remains fit for purpose in today's world and workplace. There is widespread agreement in this House, in public administration and among the public that it should be easier to access a broader range of information without the need for a formal FOI request, whether through greater proactive publication or reducing the bureaucracy involved in releasing information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> It was in the interest of strengthening and modernising the 2014 FOI legislation and considering issues such as these that my colleague, the Minister, launched a comprehensive a collaborative review of the FOI legislation. I will provide the Members with more information on progress in the review shortly and in my closing address. I sincerely thank the Deputies for taking a constructive approach to this and for offering to sit down with my officials and I and with the Minister and I am very happy to facilitate that. The Deputies can work with me on it any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> However, I will make some criticisms of the legislation they have drafted and I hope they consider them in the spirit in which they are meant. They are not meant to be offensive or an insult. There are significant technical issues with the proposals, as drafted. Advice has been received from the Office of the Attorney General and it appears that a number of the proposals would tend to either produce the opposite of the intended effect or no effect at all. In addition, each proposal would require significant further work from a policy perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> Section 2 proposes to insert an additional category of pension payments to former taoisigh, Ministers and Presidents paid out of current expenditure to the definition of personal information at section 2 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. In practice, this would copper-fasten the fact that information of this type is treated as personal information for the purposes of the Act which by default is exempt from release under section 37 of the Act. By way of background, it appears that for a time information of this nature may have been published on an administrative basis. I understand that this practice was ultimately discontinued based on legal advice as to compliance with data protection and privacy law. It was only at this point that FOI requests then began to be made for information of this nature. </p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> The question came before the Office of the Information Commissioner, OIC, for the first time relatively recently and in its decision, the office found that the personalised amount received by an individual is personal information, while the aggregate information or remuneration scales can be released under FOI. This approach is in line with long-established principles for dealing with salaries and pensions of public servants, dating back to the earliest days of FOI in Ireland. The OIC explicitly made this point in the decision and noted that the introduction of GDPR had no bearing on this outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> Notwithstanding the OIC's finding on individualised information, I understand that aggregated information to a significant level of detail, as well as scales and methods of calculation, remain available on request. It appears that what is at issue in this proposed amendment is an expansion of FOI and a change to long-established principles. In line with privacy and data protection law, including previous decisions of the European courts, any such expansion would have to be based on a clear policy objective that makes an individualised treatment necessary and proportionate in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> Section 3 proposes to amend section 6 of the principal Act in order that freedom of information comes into effect from the date of a body's establishment. At present, FOI kicks in by default six months after an entity is first established. This is a practical approach. As usual, new bodies will need time to hire staff and set up administrative systems. However, where there are particular circumstances to warrant it, the legislation also allows for an earlier date to be specified. Section 79 of the Land Development Agency Act 2021 did just that. In that case, FOI applied from day one and the reach of FOI for the new entity included records created prior to its establishment. This was appropriate, given that the new entity effectively took over from an existing body and had the means to process requests from the outset. However, as a baseline, it would seem in general that the current position is more appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> Section 4 proposes to amend section 7 of the principal Act and oblige the Minister and the Information Commissioner to carry out an annual review of entities prescribed as FOI bodies under that section. The technical issue is that no entities have been prescribed as FOI bodies to date under section 7 and, therefore, the amendment, as it stands, would have no effect. Furthermore, a wholesale annual review of inclusions or part-inclusions would appear to be administratively disproportionate. I am not sure it could be completed within a year. Currently, approximately 600 bodies overall are subject to FOI and it is unclear why an annual review would be required of the status of each one of them. Where there has been a material change to the status of a body or some other issue has arisen, this may continue to be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis, as and when it arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> Section 5 would oblige the Information Commissioner to give up his jurisdiction where he finds that, "a head intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil his obligations in a material respect under this Act" and instead refer the matter to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. It is not clear what jurisdiction the SIPO would have to take on such a referral. A detailed framework for investigation and powers would likely be required. On the other hand, insofar as a breach of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 is at issue, there is nothing to prevent a complaint being made as matters stand. The Information Commissioner already has extensive powers to review decisions of FOI bodies and to direct release of records or further searches to be carried where the commissioner believes there is a basis for doing so. While implementing FOI may be challenging, there is no evidence in the commissioner's annual reports or decided cases that there is any prevalence of a wilful disregard of FOI obligations. If such behaviour were identified, there are mechanisms through which it could be addressed and in the past, where bodies have experienced particular difficulties implementing FOI, we have seen the support and collaboration that has been forthcoming from the commissioner's office, as well as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and this has led, in turn, to marked and verifiable improvements in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> The Government decided last autumn that a comprehensive review of the FOI system was to be undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This is a complex policy area and the review will offer multiple opportunities for interested stakeholders to contribute their views. It is the intention of the Minister that the review will be completed by mid-year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> This will be followed by a memorandum to Government to outline the findings of the review and set out associated recommendations which may well include amendments to the legislation. Given the substantial overlap between the Bill before us and the wider review of the Act which has been completed, the proposed time-limited amendment of nine months to the motion that the Bill be read a Second Time will allow a sufficient period to advance the review. In the interim, Deputies are welcome to contribute further to the review. I encourage them to do so and commend them on their continued interest in improving the FOI system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1064">There is an element of agreement across the board on the relevance and necessity of FOI and the significant part it plays in us having a proper, accountable and transparent system, which has not always been the case. There have definitely been failings at State level. In fairness, I have heard the Minister make promises to increase transparency. That is making as much of government available as possible through earlier publication of records and such. All of that is sound and necessary, but Deputies Clarke and Mairéad Farrell have put forward legislation to improve upon SIPO.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> We have no problem in engaging in relation to what the Minister of State has proposed and with difficulties there may be. The point of Committee Stage is that we take in the necessary stakeholders and experts and tease it out. We all know the advantages of SIPO. We know what it does from a point of view of investigative journalists. We still have the case of Dealgan House and the tragic deaths that occurred during the early period of this pandemic. The families concerned carried out significant investigation on their own and would not have been able to do so with FOIs. However, the fact is that at times they were hampered even in dealing with State agencies such as the HSE. Material was to be handed over, then could not be and later could be following the involvement of local politicians and others. There was also to be a Bill with certain provisions and then there was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">These are the sorts of issues we must consider. We must be completely open to looking at all possible solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> This is not about trying to catch out people or getting one piece of information without context so we can hammer someone. There must also be a wider discussion if we are talking about Government or State agencies, or even some of the other bodies that must be brought to a greater degree into the freedom of information system. We must have a conversation about what is involved. Will it include every single social media outlet and everybody who sends something on Messenger? Some of the messages may not always be best received, even by me. I generally try not to engage but I accept that one would need to be a saint not to have replied rather robustly to certain people at certain times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> We will have to do significant work on this. Again, there is a missing piece. To use the Dealgan example again, there was a difficulty because it was up to the families to carry out an investigation. I reiterate that there must be an inquiry and I will speak to the Government about that. There is a large amount of information there because of the tenacity of the families. A mechanism has been promised by the Government and I will follow up on that. Those families would have been in a worse position if they did not have the likes of that freedom of information process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> If we are all in agreement, there seems to be an interest from the Minister of State and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in progressing this. Whatever the outworkings of this interaction, a plan should be put in place for a review so we can be serious about enacting recommendations afterwards. We all know there have been huge mistakes made over the years and wrongdoing that at times was incredibly difficult to uncover. To a degree, we would be better off with a system that is there to be seen. The regular people out there may sometimes have a jaundiced view of politics and how the State and certain companies operate. If we speak about people from NAMA or the Land Development Agency, it may be the case that people can only be satisfied when we can show everybody what can be shown in interactions and the legal operations that are being carried out. We can then have a wider conversation about what would necessarily fall under SIPO's ambit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> There is a large body of work to be done in this area. In fairness to the Deputies who put this Bill forward, it indicates intent from Sinn Féin in its desire to tackle this matter. I accept that the Government is engaging and trying to get us to an end point that is better, with a strengthened SIPO and a greater element of agencies, companies and organisations falling under the freedom of information process. Even with some bodies falling under the freedom of information process, there should be a greater element of that transparency and accountability. For the want of a better term, we must all put our heads together and ensure this happens. We do not want another scenario where the can is kicked down the road. We will work on the existing issues and we all want a better system for SIPO. We should do everything that needs to be done to get to that point.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1071">I commend my colleagues, Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Clarke, on the work they have put into the Bill. Transparency and accountability are cornerstones of any modern democracy and in the pursuit of transparency and accountability, the freedom of information process plays a vital role. Since the formation of this State we have seen Governments go to great lengths to hide official State information. There was infamous burning of Cabinet documents concerning the brutal policy of execution of republican prisoners during the Civil War, which is among the worst of the examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> Sadly, this State has a long and poor history when it comes to transparency and access to official State information. Other states have similar issues. In light of these failings, the public has been left reliant on individuals like Mr. Julian Assange and Mr. Edward Snowden. Were it not for their actions and those of others like them, information on countless crimes and abuses around the world would never have seen the light of day. The public should not be reliant on whistleblowers risking their lives and livelihoods to expose such injustice. As I speak, Mr. Assange remains in a maximum-security prison and Mr. Snowden will live out the rest of his days in exile, far from his home and family. What were their crimes but trying to give transparency and accountability to the public? For that reason, Mr. Assange should be freed. We in Ireland saw the horrific treatment endured by a former Garda sergeant, Mr. Maurice McCabe, including the creation of false reports and attempts at intimidation targeting him and his family. This demonstrates what can happen when transparency and accountability are lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> The freedom of information process played a key role in events like the beef tribunal and the controversy involving the public services card. A well-functioning freedom of information regime is essential to any state that values the democratic process and it is an effective tool to give to the public for holding those in power to account. This Bill is an important step to broaden the current remit of the freedom of information process. In the interests of strengthening the democratic process, I urge all Deputies to support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">It is really disappointing to see the Government's amendment, which kicks the can down the road for another nine months. It is another example of the approach of "pretend and extend". It is said that knowledge is power in any administration, particularly one involving sensitive State documents that may be leaked to personal friends, erased text messages, deletion of official correspondence, sharp violation of the freedom of information legislation and exorbitant pay rises accepted or forgone. The public needs to know about it. The so-called Zapponegate exposed a freedom of information system in crisis. The State has a long and patriarchal view of public information and the public's right to access it. Taking the example of the mother and baby homes, the attitude unfortunately persists in the treatment of adopted people and their access to full information about themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> Generally speaking, the launch of the freedom of information process in 1997 was a welcome change to the patriarchal "know better" attitude of the State to citizens seeking information that would become their right. I commend my comrades, Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Clarke, because they are really anxious to broaden that further. We seek greater accountability and specifically we would like to see a distinct role for SIPO. The Office of the Information Commissioner should be able to refer cases and complaints to SIPO where bodies are considered to have failed to have fulfilled their obligations under the relevant Acts, either recklessly or negligently. Such a role for SIPO is necessary and could easily be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> Our Bill also addresses the arbitrary nature of releases from Departments under the freedom of information process, where for the requester luck can sometimes supersede rights, as interpretations differ so widely on what is covered and released, with redactions and the withholding of information being so frequently overturned on appeal. One must wonder what is the process. In a functioning democracy, freedom of information and access to it are critical and every effort should be made for this to be achieved by the public, non-governmental organisations, academics and other interested bodies. It is how power and the use of it can be held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> The Maurice McCabe scandal and the public services card trespass into personal data and privacy was mentioned. Where is the political will to tackle this? If there is a will to tackle this, there can be a way to do so. The Government should give SIPO a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> Our Bill also requires the Minister to do an audit on public bodies to assess whether they need to be brought more fully under the remit of freedom of information and therefore into public scrutiny. Within this process, vital bodies such as the Garda and RTÉ could be brought more fully under the scope of the Act. Our Bill also seeks to close the gap in freedom of information coverage. Once a company or body becomes a public body, it would immediately enter the scope of the freedom of information legislation and not be excluded for six months, as is currently the case. I heard the Minister of State's comments but when the Land Development Agency was set up it was initially not subject to freedom of information for six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">What my comrades are proposing for FOI is important for the public and for democracy itself. We need to move to an inclusive and democratic right to know over the exclusive and sometimes patriarchal need to know. I hope the Minister of State will reconsider his amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1080">I commend my colleagues, na Teachtaí Mairéad Farrell and Sorca Clarke, on bringing forward this Bill. The Bill has been developed in close consultation with some of the State's top investigative journalists and transparency campaigners. It will address many of the shortcomings of the current FOI regime, some of which were brought into sharp focus by the events of "Zapponegate" last year. Ministers deleting official Government correspondence, which is subject to FOI, substantiated our concerns. That affair showed us that there is a lack of accountability for those failing in their obligations under the Act. Some public bodies are only partially included under the scope of FOI and they need to be brought under it more fully. Other bodies in receipt of public money are exempt entirely. Some information that was at one time available through FOI can no longer be accessed. This Bill will address each of these issues and more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> I was very disappointed to learn yesterday that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is to defer the Bill for at least nine months. Anyone who has had to submit an FOI request will know that the system requires major reform. I ask that the Minister change his mind on this. He has launched a review of the Act but that is a waste of time and resources. The problems are well-documented and this Bill offers a solution to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> We recently saw the need for reform in Kildare when the county council was faced with the prospect of having to bring the Department of Defence to court. The Department refused to co-operate with an investigation into dumping on a massive scale next door to a very scenic spot on the Curragh, beside Donnelly's Hollow. In what appears to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny and transparency, the Department finally agreed to mediation, which cost the State almost €20,000, and it appears that some sort of non-disclosure agreement has been signed to hide the details of what happened. We do not know if there will be consequences for anyone or what will stop this happening again. It is an absolute disgrace and I will not rest until we have accountability in County Kildare.</p>

          <p eId="para_1083">Tá a lán rudaí sa reachtaíocht seo agus is trua go bhfuil an tAire Stáit á chur ar athló ar feadh naoi mí. Ba chóir dó an deis a thapú é seo a chur chuig coiste chun déileáil leis. Ag an gcoiste, d’fhéadfadh sé na leasuithe faoina bhfuil sé ag caint a thabhairt isteach nó na botúin atá ann a cheartú. D’fhéadfadh an Bille a bheith os ár gcomhair agus críochnaithe roimh dheireadh an tsamhraidh. Tá sé tábhachtach go ndéanann muid cinnte de go bhfuil gach uile rud a dhéanann an Stát - ní díreach an Rialtas nó Airí ach an Stát i gcoitinne, an státchóras agus an maorlathas - trédhearcach mar muna bhfuil sé trédhearcach ní bheidh muinín ag an bpobal ann. Ceapfaidh siad go bhfuil daoine ag cur rudaí faoi cheilt agus ní hé sin an sórt sochaí gur chóir a bheith againn. I sochaí dhaonlathach agus ionraic ní bheadh gá leis seo ach sin domhan eile. Sin útóipe. Tá roinnt cásanna luaite cheana féin a léiríonn cén fáth gur gá dúinn cur leis an mbealach atá faisnéis ar shonraí ag obair faoi láthair faoin Acht. Ba chóir dúinn níos mó agus níos mó den eolas atá de dhíth ar an bpobal a chur ar fáil dóibh agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé sin de cheart acu. Sa deireadh thiar thall ba chóir go mbeadh an pobal in ann an t-eolas seo a fháil seachas gur gá dóibh dul síos bóthar na FOIs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> Uaireanta fiú nuair a lorgaíonn muidne freagraí ar cheisteanna anseo, ní ó Airí amháin ach ó dhaoine a thagann isteach os comhair coistí, ní fhaigheann muid freagra. Ansin bíonn orainne casadh, mar Theachtaí Dála, ar bhealach eile agus sin trí FOI. Mar shampla, bhí cúigear nó ceathrar ón nGarda Síochána os comhair Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge inné. Ní raibh muid in ann freagra a fháil ar ché a mhol athrú sa chóras chun céim in airde a thabhairt do sháirsint agus fáil réidh leis an gcoinníoll Gaeilge dóibh. Ní raibh aon duine den cheathrar a bhí os ár gcomhair in ann freagra a thabhairt dúinn maidir le cén duine a tháinig isteach go dtí an coiste acusan chun é sin a mholadh. Tá a fhios againn go ndearnadh é mar tá sé déanta. Tá a fhios againn mar dúirt Coimisinéir an Gharda Síochána agus an leas-choimisinéir linn go ndearnadh an cinneadh agus nach é an Garda Síochána a lorg an cinneadh seo. Anois, toisc nach féidir linn an freagra a fháil, beidh orainne iarratas FOI a dhéanamh ar na cruinnithe, na coistí agus an comhfhreagras ar fad. Sin cur amú ama don státchóras.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Ní díreach an cás sin atá i gceist. Tá cásanna eile ann. Déanann daoine trál ar rudaí seachas an fón a phiocadh suas agus gheobhaidh tú freagra nach bhfuil an rud ar an idirlíon, go bhfuil taifead ceart á choimeád ag gach uile dhuine agus nach bhfuil daoine ag cur rudaí faoi cheilt. Chonaic muid thar na blianta go raibh daoine ag cur rudaí faoi cheilt. I roinnt cásanna níor thuig siad cad a bhí ar bun acu ach in a lán cásanna bhí siad ag triail iad féin a chosaint mar ní raibh siad sásta bheith freagrach as botúin. Nuair a dhéanann tú botún an rud is fearr ná do lámh a chur suas agus a rá go bhfuil botún déanta agat. Fiú muna bhfuil botún déanta agat, má cheapann an pobal go bhfuil an cinneadh mícheart déanta agat ba chóir go mbeadh tú mór go leor chun seasamh suas agus a rá go bhfuil tú sásta seasamh leis an gcinneadh a ghlac tú. Sin an fáth nár chóir go mbeadh eagla ar dhaoine roimh FOI. Ní chóir go mbeadh eagla ar an státchóras, ar Airí nó ar aon duine eile as seo amach má tá siad compordach sa seasamh atá siad tar éis a ghlacadh. Is trua go bhfuil muid san áit ina bhfuilimid ach toisc go bhfuil muid ann, tá éacht déanta ag na Teachtaí Mairéad Farrell agus Sorca Clarke ag brú an cháis seo chun cinn agus é á chur os ár gcomhair diaidh ar ndiaidh. Tá siad ag cinntiú nach bhfuil sé curtha ar leataobh agus go bhfuil muid ag bogadh sa treo ceart. Amach anseo, beidh an státchóras i bhfad Éireann níos oscailte agus ní bheidh daoine ag dul i bhfolach taobh thiar de FOI agus ag cur moille sa chaoi go bhfuil sé ró-dheireanach faoin am a thagann an freagra amach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> Luaigh daoine eile cásanna ina raibh ar dhream áirithe mar an Air Corps nó saighdiúirí dul go dtí FOI nó ceisteanna parlaiminte, maidir le Lariam, mar shampla. Ní chóir go mbeadh orthu é sin a dhéanamh in a lán bealaí mar is a sonraí pearsanta féin a bhí i gceist ach sin an bealach atá sé. Is costas mór é ansin, seachas daoine a bheith ionraic agus oscailte. </p>

        <speech by="#PaulDonnelly" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Deputy Paul Donnelly<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1087">I thank Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Clarke for bringing this Bill forward. Freedom of information is extremely important in terms of openness, transparency and, most important, accountability. I listened to the Minister of State's reply and I cannot understand his opposition to the Bill or his amendment, or why the Government will be kicking this down the road for another nine months. As has been said, this Bill will broaden the current remit of FOI by requiring the Minister to conduct an annual review of public bodies. I do not see a problem with that. It would allow the Minister to bring public bodies that are only partially covered by FOI more fully under the Act. Again, what is the problem there? Why would we need to wait nine months before that is enacted? It could easily be worked on now. Further, the Bill would increase accountability by allowing the Office of the Information Commissioner to refer complaints to SIPO for investigation, where bodies have been found to have intentionally or recklessly failed to fulfil their obligations in a material respect under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> The Minister of State claims that SIPO does not have the powers for this but he is ignoring the fact that SIPO itself has been calling for greater powers. This is a constant kicking down the road. This organisation has been asking for extra powers for a very long time and the Government is saying we should just keep kicking it down the road so we do not get accountability. This Bill would help ensure that public bodies act consistently and appropriately when fulfilling their FOI duties. It would ensure there is no gap in FOI coverage when a company or other body becomes a public body. For what reason was that introduced in the first place?</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I find it strange that a public body would be given six months to allow it to do whatever it wanted and it was not accountable to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> When I was researching this topic, I looked at one of the reports. One of the things which really struck me was the decision to abolish the fee for making FOI requests. Sometimes, something strikes home. In this case, I wondered why we were charging people for information. What is the possible reason that we would have a charge for people seeking their own information, or other information that should be in the public domain? It is a strange practice if we are talking about openness, transparency and accountability. This aspect must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> There was a 67% increase in usage levels over 2014. There were 34,000 requests when the fee was abolished. This shows that people are very interested and are demanding more openness and transparency. We have frequently seen how a simple FOI can expose corruption and protect whistleblowers. Those following journalists and other people who use the FOI legislation regularly will see that vast tracts of information are missing or page upon page are redacted and blacked out. Occasionally, it will be possible only to get the page number at the bottom of the information provided. One person whom I follow on Twitter regularly seeks material under FOI legislation, and also gives courses and provides training on FOI, how to access information and the questions it is necessary to ask.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> Why is it necessary to provide training for people to get information from public bodies? Why is it that there are specific questions that need to be asked? Why must certain ways and various avenues be pursued to improve the likelihood of getting the information required? Why do we need to do that? Why does somebody need to put such a course in place? What are people hiding? That is the only reason for people to do that. If we were open, transparent and accountable, then people would not have to present training courses to show others how to get information from public bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> We consistently hear of cases where we are told that the required information does not exist, only to find out later, and again mostly due to persistence and the training provided by the person referred to earlier, that the information in question does exist. We have a case of that where the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, stated in the House that he had deleted texts from his phone in direct contravention of the freedom of information legislation. The Minister told the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that he did not “retain texts for storage reasons”. Anybody who has an iPhone, or any other type of phone, will know that is quite an incredible reason to give. A spokesperson for the Minister said that: "The minister’s phone has been hacked in the past and as a result he regularly clears his phone". This is a clear example of why we need reform of our FOI legislation and why this should not be kicked down the road for another nine months.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-02-03T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1094">I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate on this legislation. I also reiterate my thanks to Deputies Mairéad Farrell and Clarke for bringing forward the Bill. I have already set out in some detail my views on the legislation as currently drafted, which highlighted technical and policy issues regarding further consideration. I have, however, heard and noted the comments made by the Deputies and all the other Members who have contributed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> I will avail of this opportunity to update the House on the progress of the ongoing review of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, has made clear, and I fully agree with him, that the review should take the form of an open and collaborative process. To this end, shortly after the Government approved the review, the Department published a roadmap document setting out the process and anticipated timelines for the review. This document is available on the Department’s website and social media channels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> An initial public consultation then followed on the scope of the review. This was intended as a way for the Department to look beyond the bare statistics and to seek to understand, in general terms, the kinds of issues of concern to stakeholders across all sectors. We had almost 1,200 responses from public bodies, workers across the Civil Service and public sector, civil society, journalists, academics and other representatives who contributed a wealth of experience and expertise to the process. These responses are still being analysed by the Department, and they will form the basis of a more detailed consultation document to be published in the spring, which will seek views on identified themes and issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> Alongside that endeavour, the Department will shortly roll out a customer satisfaction survey. It will aim to gain a much deeper understanding of how the FOI system is operating in practice and how it is perceived by those at the coalface, including information requesters and the staff of public bodies who fulfil the requests. Other work has been ongoing in the background. For example, the Department has begun to assess developments in other countries to see what lessons can be learned from those experiences. The Department will continue to work closely with the OIC in progressing this project, but it will also liaise closely with other key sectoral stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> One of the challenges in undertaking the review is doing justice to the breadth of the FOI system. The Department will continue to proactively seek views from individuals and advocacy groups who may be able to provide insights regarding the use of FOI legislation in particular contexts. Other elements of the review process will include interviews, focus groups, case studies and a project to estimate the resourcing and cost implications of the FOI system. As will be apparent, this is an ambitious and thorough review process. I reiterate, just in case, that there is no intention to reintroduce fees. The review process aims to build a strong, evidential foundation to further develop and improve approaches to public sector transparency, as well as to seek the broadest possible range of views and policy options.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> The review looks at structural issues that may plot a broader course for developing public sector transparency measures in the medium to longer term, as well as more incremental changes which will aim to improve practices and outcomes in the short term in the current system. The review is still at a relatively early stage, and its recommendations will be based on the evidence as it emerges. While I cannot pre-empt the outcome, I reiterate my earlier stated view, which is one the Minister agrees with and has previously stated in this House as well, that there has been a vast expansion of FOI usage since 2014. There may, however, be a point of diminishing returns in the context of the growth of the number of requests. More requests may mean that individuals are having to jump through unnecessary bureaucratic hoops to access information which should be provided in a much more direct and straightforward way. The target, therefore, is not necessarily to have the maximum number of requests. That may not be the utopia that we seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> More requests may also mean that bodies are not publishing information that should be generally available without the need to make FOI requests. Equally, there is the ongoing need to balance access with their important rights and interests in respect of information held by public bodies, such as privacy or commercial sensitivity. While FOI legislation may have opened the doors and the filing cabinets of State bodies and played a key role in entrenching transparency as a core principle of public administration, there is an open question as to whether alternative or supplemental approaches are required to build on that success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> Depending on one's point of view, the progenitor of the Irish FOI approach may be taken to be the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act 1766, which is usually seen as the first FOI law. More directly, probably, it may stem from the US Freedom of Information Act 1967. In either case, as I have previously noted, the FOI requests model as we know it is based on the assumption of paper-based administration.</p>

I am not going to lie to the House and say I am not disappointed that the Minister of State is not going to withdraw his amendment. It is a lost opportunity. The Minister of State mentioned that the Minister had committed to undertaking a review within a time which falls well short of the nine months for which the Government is seeking to amend our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> That said, there is common ground here on which we can build. I welcome the Minister of State' openness to engaging with Deputy Mairéad Farrell and me on this issue. There is a fundamental principle in the Freedom of Information Act 2014 which is best served in the public interest and that is where the focus must be. I refer to ensuring that the information which is available is freely available and freely accessible through an FOI Act which functions in the best interests of the public.</p>
