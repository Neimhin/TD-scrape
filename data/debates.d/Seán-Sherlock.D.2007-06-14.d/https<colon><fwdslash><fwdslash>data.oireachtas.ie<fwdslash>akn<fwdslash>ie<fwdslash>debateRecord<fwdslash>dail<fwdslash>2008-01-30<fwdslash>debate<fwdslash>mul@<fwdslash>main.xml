         asked the

         the policy changes he plans to strengthen the resistance of the economy here to a downturn, in view of the loss of its competitive edge and the tougher global environment.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">Last month in my budget, I indicated that the outlook is for a moderation in the rate of economic expansion this year.  At the time, my Department forecast GDP and GNP to rise by 3% and 2.8%, respectively.  These forecasts reflected the transition to a more sustainable level of output in the new housing sector and a more moderate rate of growth in some of our major trading partners was assumed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">In my budget, I indicated risks to this outlook, including a less benign international economic climate.  However, the general consensus is that once these adverse influences begin to fade, the pace of economic growth in Ireland will return to our potential growth rate of between 4% and 4.5% because our medium-term prospects remain favourable and the economy's underlying fundamentals are strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">For example, we have a dynamic and well-educated labour force, we have flexible markets that allow us to respond efficiently to adverse developments, we have a pro-business, outward-looking society, our public finances are sound, as indicated by the low level of public indebtedness, our unemployment rate is among the lowest in the euro area and our tax rates on capital and labour are low.  Therefore, while there are risks to the economic outlook and overall sentiment has deteriorated in recent weeks, we are meeting these challenges from a position of relative strength.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">Notwithstanding this assessment, policies are in place to help to improve our competitive position and enable us to absorb the impact of any deterioration in the global environment in a more efficient manner.  In this context, my recent budget provided a significant stimulus, with current spending rising by 8% while revenues are projected to rise by approximately 3.5% this year.  I announced an increase of approximately 12% in capital spending, confirming again that the implementation of the national development plan would be a key priority of the Government.  The consensus approach to policy formulation through social partnership will help us to address any short-term economic slowdown by ensuring that all stakeholders in our economy have a shared sense of the emerging issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_6">Where is the strategy to protect Ireland from the worst threats posed by global difficulties?  It is commonly accepted that, under this Government and the Tánaiste as Minister for Finance, we became too reliant on the property boom, which the Government fuelled.  The rankings provided by the National Competitiveness Council show that we have slid 17 places and, in the past five years, lost export market share, which is the key to growth for a small, open economy.  Does the Tánaiste agree with the council that, to restore cost competitiveness, a national programme driven by the Government with specific targets for utilities, where the Government is the key regulator, and other areas of public service pricing is necessary?  Government-generated price increases have undermined our competitiveness.  Does the Minister agree we need this sort of approach, which would confront matters like the excessive growth of quangos, excessive bureaucracy in many public services and better cost structures, and that we need a concerted drive to reinvent Ireland so we can be competitive in a tougher environment?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_7">In general terms, as we face into more moderate growth rates in the immediate years ahead, the level of resources that will become available means that we must use the existing level of resources as efficiently as possible.  The role of Government is to ensure that this happens.  In respect of competitiveness, inflation and price stability, we will continue to have a budgetary stance that best guarantees that outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">While the international situation and sentiment have deteriorated, we are in a position of relative strength because the policies of the Government have halved our indebtedness during good times and have put in place a national development plan which seeks to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks.  This would enhance our competitiveness through that kind of investment and the type of planned investment we have in science, technology and innovation.  All these are real building blocks to maintain and enhance growth prospects in the years ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_9">Will the Tánaiste agree to some specific initiatives?  For example, in the electricity sector, we are clearly 50% dearer than many of our competitors.  It appears that we have decided to pay the chief executive much more.  Will the Tánaiste demand that there be benchmarks for competitiveness in this utility set?</p>
            <p eId="para_10">Will he agree to audit the number of quangos that have been established and which now run to 500, an increase of 200 under this Administration?  Does he agree that we must look at these in order to squeeze better value from public money?  Will he agree to take some definite time-limited initiatives to drive some of the change that he appears to accept in principle but where little is happening in practice?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_11">I do not accept that little is happening in practice.  An efficiency review has been put in place to see how we can look at issues there.  In respect of the overall point made by Deputy Bruton, be it in respect of utility prices or electricity, and the Minister concerned with the advent of the all-island electricity market, which brings its own competitive pressures, we are moving from the old-style State monopoly of the past into a far more competitive environment.  The investments envisaged and the question of moving to renewables and trying to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy and build up a competitive domestic energy industry are part of the policy framework to which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is working.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joan Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         if he is satisfied that the budgetary framework of revenues and expenditures set out by him in budget 2008 remains viable in view of the changed international financial environment and the revised downward projection of housing construction here and output for 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_13">On budget day, my Department projected a GDP growth rate of 3% for this year and a GNP growth rate of 2.8%.  While lower than that experienced in recent years, this is still a robust rate of growth, given the prevailing international conditions.  At budget time, my Department estimated that house completions in 2008 would be around 55,000 units.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">I believe that, in aggregate terms, the budget day forecasts, which were presented to the House last month, are still appropriate.  Of course, as was noted at budget time, there are risks, both internal and external, to these economic forecasts and my Department will, as always, continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">As regards the budgetary projections for tax and expenditure, it is still very early in the year and there is no reason to alter the budgetary forecasts at this time.  Overall, current spending is budgeted to increase by approximately €4 billion or about 8%, capital spending by approximately €1 billion or around 12% and tax revenues by just over €1.6 billion or 3.5% in 2008.  The general Government debt level is projected to be around 26% of GDP at the end of this year, one of the lowest levels in the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">As with economic developments, my Department monitors tax receipts and expenditure on an ongoing basis and as more data becomes available during the year, any significant changes to the expected Exchequer position in 2008 will be signalled and presented at the end of each quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">It is important to remember that the fundamentals of the Irish economy remain strong and that the economy has responded quickly and effectively to changing economic conditions in the past.  Short-term movements in financial markets have limited effects on wider economic trends.  Of course, any deterioration in financial market conditions sustained over a prolonged period of time could spill over into economic developments.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_18">I thank the Minister for that reply.  Does the Minister agree that last week was a bit of a train wreck for the Irish economy in terms of billions knocked off the value of Irish shares, particularly Irish pension funds?  We have had a string of job loss announcements, including the most recent one in Wicklow, of several hundred jobs over the next year and a half.  Every financial forecast since the general election and on through the budget is slightly worse than the previous one.  Does the Tánaiste have figures for his expectation of housing output, including starts and completed houses, this year?  Does he expect it to fall as low as 30,000 units?  What will be the impact of this on tax receipts and revenue?  What plans does the Tánaiste have, if we achieve the growth of 3% he suggests, to assist those who face court in respect of mortgage repayments and those who, having worked in the construction industry for ten years, now find it difficult to find employment?  Does the Tánaiste have plans to give a fresh start at work to people whose experience is in the construction industry?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_8" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Mr. Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_19">There is evidence that there will be some reduction in the residential housing output and, therefore, less employment in the construction sector.  However, as far as construction industry forecasts are concerned, there is still activity in commercial property, house renovation and the increased impact of extra investment in the Government's capital investment programme.  There are some compensating factors.  The construction industry is not made up solely of the new house residential market, important as that is.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">Over the past decade, the number of people employed in the construction industry has doubled.  With slower growth rates this year, the level of activity will be lower than the high base of 70,000 last year.  We have made an assumption of a reduction of 25%, down to 55,000 units.  We must wait and see how it pans out.  This also assumes no change in interest rates.  I cannot speculate on what will happen in respect of interest rates in the euro area.  It would improper of me to do so, since it is a matter for the European Central Bank.  Given the reduction in interest rates in the US, there is a possibility of an interest rate cut here.  It is speculative and I do not suggest whether it will happen.  The ECB has always emphasised price stability as the main mandate under the Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Any major turbulence in equity markets is unwanted and unwelcome, but these markets often exhibit short-term volatility.  The impact should not be over-exaggerated.  It is important to bear in mind that share prices go up and down all the time but the underlying real economy remains the same and we must focus on this aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">As a small, globally integrated economy with considerable exposure to the US economy, Ireland cannot be immune to external economic developments.  The greater than normal level of uncertainty that characterised the global economy was identified as a key risk in my recent Budget Statement.  While we can exert no influence over external developments, we can ensure our economy can absorb external shocks in an efficient manner.  It is important to stress that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong.  Therefore, we must address it from a position of relative strength.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_23">Is the Tánaiste trying to have it both ways?  In the run-up to the election, he was happy to portray himself as the person responsible for Irish economic growth.  Now that we are facing into difficulties, another set of bodies and factors is to blame such as the international financial situation, the European Central Bank and the Council of Ministers.  The Minister has no hands-on approach, yet he has some responsibility to bear for the downturn in the economy and the impact it is having on families, particularly those losing their jobs in the construction industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Does the Minister have a response for the changed circumstances in which we find ourselves?  The Government presides over a continuing set of service price increases which are part of the reason we have one of the highest inflation rates in the EU.  The Minister is responsible for the good times but is not responsible when times get bad.  Does the Minister have a response ready for what is happening in the economy?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_10" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_25">We have a responsibility whether times are good or bad.  The consistent policy framework we have adopted over the past ten years has served the country well.  During that period there was extraordinary economic growth and employment creation with a reduction of our indebtedness by half.  We are in a position to withstand some of these external shocks far more capably than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">I made a response in my budget to emerging economic downside risks.  These had begun in August 2007 with the fall-out from the US sub-prime market problems that led to an international credit crunch.  My budgetary stance represented a 1.5% of GDP stimulus to the economy at a time when the downturn was emerging.  That was the right choice to make.  I felt the right course was to borrow modestly to invest ambitiously.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">An extra €1.7 billion will go into the economy on social expenditure, half of which will go to social welfare recipients to protect those on the lowest incomes.  A €500 million tax package will put more money back into workers' pockets ensuring they benefit from their productivity.  A further €1 billion extra over what was planned will go into the national development plan capital investment programme.  That is a measured and responsible response to the downside risks that were beginning to emerge.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Public service pay must develop in a manner consistent with competitiveness, price stability and budgetary policy.  Government policy on public service pay is that the public service should be in a position to attract and retain its fair share of good quality staff at all levels.  It should neither lead the market nor trail it.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The current public service pay agreement under Towards 2016 expires in September 2008 and talks on a new agreement are due to commence soon.  Towards 2016 provides that implementation of the public service benchmarking report will be discussed by the parties in the context of discussions on whatever arrangements on pay and conditions are to be put in place on the expiry of the current public service pay agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">Benchmarking has been accepted by employers and unions as a significant improvement on the old pay determination system.  That was based on relativities whereby if one grade or group of public sector workers received an increase, it led to leap-frogging and catch-up claims across the public service.  Experience, particularly during the 1990s, showed the demands for pay increases by reference to relativities were not sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">The benchmarking body produced a report in accordance with its terms of reference.  It is agreed between the Government and the trade unions that the best approach to ensuring that individual public service grades are paid appropriately is to compare all aspects of public sector jobs with their private sector equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">While the current benchmarking exercise may yield little for most public servants, they have benefited significantly in recent years from the first benchmarking exercise and the general round increases under successive national agreements.  The framework in place of assurances of regular benchmarking reviews of public service pay against the market, conditionality of pay increases on the basis of co-operation with change and industrial relations stability and verification mechanisms is a balanced and sensible approach to the management of public service pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">In more difficult international economic conditions, maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of our economy is critical, particularly for a small open economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">The level of annual pay increases has increased from approximately 3% under the earlier national partnership deals to just over 6% in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and still over 4% under Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016.  This is well ahead of pay developments in our main trading partners.  This is not sustainable in the long term and particularly not in more adverse economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Pay settlements must reflect the economic fundamentals.  With strong economic growth and productivity increasing strongly, as we experienced over the past decade, there was scope for greater flexibility in the level of pay increases.  Pay developments in the period immediately ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and be more directly linked to changes in productivity.  In recent years, Ireland's competitiveness has disimproved.  We need to halt and reverse this trend.  Containing costs and improving productivity is critical for the private sector, particularly in more difficult economic circumstances.  The same is true of the public service.  Public service pay levels can only increase at a rate that is consistent with budgetary discipline and national competitiveness.  In addition, the productivity and efficiency of the public service needs to be improved on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance said: "Pay settlements must reflect the economic fundamentals".  However, under the report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, the Tánaiste is getting an increase of €36,500, which is higher than the average industrial wage.  The Taoiseach, who now gets €310,000, has the highest salary of any leader in the democratic world.  He got an increase in excess of €38,000, making his salary almost ten times the average industrial wage.  Does the Tánaiste believe it is correct for him and the Taoiseach to tell workers to accept pay restraints while they take exorbitant increases that are not performance related?</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The terms of reference of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector state that it should take account of the state of the public finances.  It also refers to performance-related increases.  The Government discounted the performance-related increases but took them.  The increases were merely recommended and the Government did not need to take them on board.  Governments are elected by the people to represent the people.  In a recent opinion poll, 81% of people stated Ministers were wrong to accept pay increases.  Does the Tánaiste believe it was correct to take the increases when the Government is asking others to exercise pay restraint?</p>

            <p eId="para_39">The pay of public servants is set by reference to rates in the private sector.  The review body, like the benchmarking body, the Labour Court and the arbitration boards, is part of the established pay determination machinery.  Both the review body and the benchmarking body compared public sector jobs to jobs of equal value in the private sector.  The review body found that the salaries of many senior public service posts were below private sector levels even when allowance was made for the value of pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">The benchmarking body found the majority of public service grades had not fallen behind private sector rates at equivalent levels.  The benchmarking body's comparisons were with the weighted average of private sector rates.  The review body comparisons were made with the lower quartile of the private sector rates.  Furthermore, they did not attach significant weight to published information on the remuneration packages of the chief executives of the top Irish plcs.  As the review pointed out, the overall effect of the review is that the salaries recommended are below the average levels of salaries of comparable posts in the private sector.  Pay determination mechanisms are in place.  They represent the established procedures by which these matters are addressed.  What has not been suggested to me in terms of an alternative is what anomalies are created by not accepting recommendations coming from such bodies.  Doing so would create more anomalies than those we seek to eliminate.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">The Government has been selective in accepting recommendations.  It accepted a recommendation on the pay but did not accept the recommendation for increases to be performance related.  The Tánaiste did not answer my question.  The ordinary benchmarking report gave few increases to workers on relatively low to middle salaries.  However, Ministers are taking increases of well above the average industrial wage.  At a time when it is seeking pay restraint in future negotiations with little given to the ordinary workers under benchmarking, does the Tánaiste believe it is correct to accept such exorbitant increases, which are more than the average industrial wage?</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         the action he will take to meet the budgetary cost of the proposed revision of the EU emissions trading scheme as set out by the European Commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [2388/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_26" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_54">The proposals published by the Commission begin the process which will lead to an agreement on the contributions of individual member states towards meeting the EU targets agreed at the 2007 EU Spring Council.  The Commission's proposals require Ireland to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2005 emissions figures and achieve an overall target of 16% of final energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">The proposals set out by the Commission are complex and far reaching and go beyond changes to the emission trading scheme.  They require detailed analysis and discussion at EU and domestic level and my Department will be central to this process.  The cost in budgetary terms and the economic impact will depend on the methods used to achieve whatever target is finally set.  We will try to be as fiscally neutral as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">The Government fully supports the objectives agreed at the EU Spring Council last year and the leadership shown by the EU's ambitions in this area of climate change.  It is important that national circumstances and competitiveness impacts are considered.  In this regard it is essential to ensure that the Commission's proposals adequately take into account the Irish situation with regard to the large difference between our gross domestic product and gross national income, our infrastructural deficit, our recent and projected levels of population growth and the relatively large size of the Irish agriculture sector and its global competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">It is important, however, to look positively on the challenge and not just dwell on the negatives.  To the extent, for example, that extra capital spending generates fuel and other efficiencies in using natural resources this will be to our overall economic and fiscal benefit.  The proposals for the emissions trading scheme also involves new revenue streams for national governments which will also form part of the policy mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">As I outlined in my Budget Statement this is a challenge for all citizens and not just the Government and will involve choices being made and changes in behaviour to realise the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The Government has been acting over recent years to begin to address the challenge of climate change and we will continue to work towards reducing emissions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_59">Does the Tánaiste accept the widely-held view that the EU proposals will probably result in costing Ireland €1 billion per annum?  How will this be done without very significant increases in the price of electricity and fuel?  Is he proposing to contribute to the emissions trading scheme in order to buy our way out of this and that consumers and business will pay those costs?  Where is the evidence that we will meet our renewables target of generating 16% through renewables in any serious way?  It is all small pilot schemes.  What is the Tánaiste's approach to this matter?  It seems the Government and, in particular, the Tánaiste, took their eyes off the ball and did not make the point to Brussels that our calculation of GDP is heavily influenced by the fact that Ireland has so much American investment and profit repatriation and that our very welcome growth in GNP and in wealth is relatively recent.  We will be clobbered because it will be based on wealth and on ability to pay.  On the other hand, eastern European countries in the EU which have heavily polluting industries left over from the old Soviet era will be dealt with much more favourably than Ireland.  Will the Tánaiste be wearing the Irish jersey when he goes to Brussels to look for a better deal for Irish consumers and businesses?  We are all in favour of reducing our carbon footprint and not being "Bigfoots", but we need to do it in a way that takes into account the realities of this island and what has not happened on climate change measures here.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_28" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_60">It is important to point out that we are at the start of a process here rather than at the end of one.  We have proposals from the Commission and we are anxious to ensure it is a fair and transparent system that provides a fair measure of burden-sharing consistent with the criteria that have been outlined.  These targets are part of a number of proposals that were released last week but they represent the start of a process that may take some time.  We are analysing the impact of those proposals from an Irish perspective and this process is being mirrored in all other member states as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">As with other finance Ministers, I have concerns about any initiatives that increase costs.  However, this must be balanced by the findings of the reports produced by Stern and the IPCC that long-term costs of inaction may be substantial and hence the need to act.  However, we have to be still mindful that there are also substantial economic and fiscal implications for the implementation of policies to tackle and adapt to climate change.  Our challenge is to ensure that the transition to a low carbon economy is handled in a way that is consistent with competitiveness, supports sound and sustainable management of public finances and contributes to broader growth objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">At this stage we have not completed our assessment of the domestic impact of the Commission's proposals.  While the Commission has modelled some scenarios on the basis of their proposals, we do not have the detail behind those calculations.  In any event, much depends on what measures we as a country take in the future and what will be the policy mix.  Long-term economic forecasting, of its nature, is imprecise and projections have to be treated with caution.  The Commission indicated that there would be costs in terms of investment but that these would vary with the measures chosen and would fall on a wide variety of players in the economy.  In addition, the forecast for any possible reduction of GDP by 2020 is indicative only.  To bring about the reductions will mean choices being made and it will be a matter for all citizens to play a part.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">We will robustly test the proposals coming from the Commission to see whether they represent a fair and transparent process in so far as Ireland is concerned.  We will bring particular Irish considerations and circumstances to the Commission's attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">As regards the emissions trading scheme, it is part of the process.  It is often suggested that in some way it is an illegitimate part of the process but it is a legitimate means by which burden-sharing can be efficiently handled by way of buying carbon credits from countries where there is not the same problem.  It is a question of finding a mix in terms of all the mechanisms that are available to us and this represents a serious challenge.</p>

Almost all the emphasis in the budget on transport investment was in regard to roads, with public transport in the here and now getting very little.  We do not have enough buses, trains or carriages.  That is how we will reduce our emissions.  Our transport emissions are among the ones that have risen at the greatest level.  If the Minister had the chance to rewrite the budget, would he give a little more to public transport?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_43" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_80">My Department provides assistance to e-Government projects in terms of funding and advice, in the context of providing similar funding and advice to ICT projects generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Under e-Government policy this Department specifically committed to developing an e-procurement strategy that included a service for on-line tendering, a shared system for human resource management, an e-Estimates system, and shared voice and data communications infrastructure for the public service.  All of these projects have been successfully completed and have resulted in significant savings and improved processes and efficiencies.  For example, it has been conservatively estimated that the shared communications approach has resulted in the region of €25 million in savings per annum.  Consequently, I am satisfied with my Department's successful contribution to the e-Government strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">However, I also want to take this opportunity to comment on the broader aspects of e-Government.  e-Government is not just about technology — it is also about making public services more responsive and efficient by a process of analysis and reform of underlying schemes and processes.  It is an ongoing programme as technology develops and as our society increasingly embraces technology.  Government services must be in a position to meet the evolving needs of our citizens, both those who have access to advanced technology and those who do not.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">In addition to the service improvement delivered by my Department that I have listed, I want to mention, in particular, the Citizens Information, formerly OASIS, website providing comprehensive on-line information on all public services; Revenue on-line services, which are used by both businesses and PAYE taxpayers to interact on-line with the State on their tax matters; new services to allow vehicle owners to renew their motor tax on-line; on-line property registration services which have improved service and greatly reduced the process time; streamlined birth notification services, which mean that most new mothers are now paid child benefit automatically; a range of on-line services and systems for farmers including single payments, area aid, animal tagging etc.; a range of on-line systems supporting the marine and natural resources industries including licence applications, scientific information etc.; exam results and school inspection reports on-line; electronic payment systems for public officials, trade suppliers and ordinary citizens; and e-Cabinet supporting the business of Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_85">These services, and many others, have resulted in significant improvements in public administration and in far more being done with less.  For example, the numbers of people in employment and thus with tax records has grown dramatically with no increases in Revenue staff, while the changes in child benefit have allowed staff to be redeployed to other areas requiring attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Looking forward, the provision and integration of full on-line services is extremely complex and care needs to be taken that we do this as cost effectively as possible.  We are making reasonable progress and the recent 2008 e-Government Readiness Index produced by the United Nations shows that Ireland is now part of a cluster of countries including countries generally considered progressive in e-Government such as Austria, Finland, Germany and Singapore.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">The Deputy will be aware of the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on e-Government which will now be considered by the PAC.  It is popular in the media, and indeed in parts of this House, to suggest that this report demonstrates that e-Government in Ireland has been a failure.  Of course the report does no such thing.  No objective observer could describe the story of e-Government in Ireland as one of failure.  To do so would be to denigrate the valuable work of those who have delivered the excellent projects I have mentioned, and many others.  It would be to set a standard for the public service that in Government ICT projects anything less than unequivocal and total success is failure, a standard that in reality no one seeking to deliver any ICT project in the public or the private sector could accept.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">This is not to say that there have not been some difficulties and challenges.  Some things did take longer than would have been hoped at the outset and some things did cost more than originally expected.  We are dealing here with the novel, in terms of technology and organisational change.  There is no easy set of solutions.  It is clear that the larger Departments and offices which have already made excellent progress will continue to do that as they have the necessary resources, experience and skills.  It is also clear that there must now be a greater focus on the small and medium sized public bodies to help them achieve more in terms of delivering on-line services.  The public service has already done considerable work in analysing how best to proceed from here.  Last year, the Government set up a review of Reach and the Public Services Broker.  That review is due in the near future.  Additionally, our colleagues in the OECD have been reviewing e-Government in general as part of their review of the public service.  I am satisfied that the combination of recommendations from these reviews coupled with the internal analysis that is being done will help us to determine the most appropriate structures, governance and priorities to ensure the continuing success of our e-Government programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I am amazed that the Tánaiste is happily deluding himself that the Government is making progress on e-Government.  I wonder has he read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on e-Government.  It shows that €420 million was spent and half of the delivery promised was achieved.  It is a programme that shows little evidence of substantial savings from the application of information technology, and numerous initiatives started and then abandoned, including ones on housing grants, driving licences and passports.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">One may ask the role of the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in all of this.  The Tánaiste was a member of the high level Cabinet committee that was supposed to be driving this.  His Secretary General was on the high level committee of Secretaries General that was supposed to be driving this.  Once again, the Tánaiste is high on rhetoric but when it comes to delivering results, he is just marked absent.  I want the Tánaiste to address what his role was in the failure to deliver this programme and in the continuing failure to have any programme to replace it since it expired at the end of 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I do not agree with the representation that Deputy Bruton puts on these matters.  It is popular to suggest, for example, that the report to which he refers demonstrates that e-Government has been a failure.  Of course the report does no such thing.  No objective observer could describe the story of e-Government in Ireland as one of failure.  To do so is to denigrate the valuable work of those who have delivered the excellent projects I have mentioned, and many others.

We are dealing here with the fact that there is no easy set of solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">The report highlights a number of what it describes as cost overruns.  In interpreting those, I sound a note of caution for Deputies.  Many of the budgets and estimated outturns as quoted in the report relate to different matters.  For example, in some cases the budget relates to pilot developments whereas the expected outturns relate to full development, implementation and operation.  In others, the budget relates to single year estimates, whereas the estimated outturns relate to multi-year expenditure.  In numerous projects the scope was changed from that originally envisaged because the analysts found opportunities to do more or to implement additional process efficiencies or had to deal with changes in legislation or the international environment that resulted in increases in costs over those for which they had originally budgeted.  Such is the nature of e-government.  This is something that is common across all countries attempting to improve public services in this way.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">When the Minister is asked a difficult question, he responds by reading blather from his file, which is a bit wearing.  He was asked what was his role in this regard.  This was a programme that, for example in the public service broker, was approved without a budget.  There was no matching budget for it and no evaluation of what was going on with it.  It cost two and a half times over budget.  The programme shows that no substantial savings were achieved as a result of the ICT initiative.  Where was the Minister when this was happening?</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Programmes were initiated and money spent on them, then they were abandoned.  What was the Minister's role, as part of the Cabinet sub-committee, in monitoring these programmes that, having been initiated, wasted significant amounts of public moneys?  His role is to ride shotgun on such programmes and ensure that ambitious visions are delivered on time and on budget.  This fell asunder while the Minister was at the helm.  The Minister was asked what was his role at the helm and why this happened on his watch.</p>

        <b>Deputy David Stanton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         if he has assessed the differential impact of recent inflation on certain families. 
        [2086/08] 
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_65" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_115">Inflation, as measured by the CPI, averaged 4.9% in 2007.  On budget day, 5 December 2007, my Department forecast that consumer price index inflation would average 3% this year.  This forecast was based on the normal technical assumption of unchanged interest rates and is predicated on the rate of inflation moderating as this year progresses, and it remains my Department's forecast for 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">Including the impact of mortgage rate increases in the CPI not only masks the underlying inflation rate but also highlights the short-term impact of interest rate increases which are designed to bring down inflation.  As such, a better measure of inflation than the consumer price index is the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, which excludes, among other things, mortgage interest and is a more realistic measure of inflation.  The average increase in the HICP in 2007 was 2.8% and the forecast increase for 2008 is 2.4%.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In terms of those families whose income earners would be classified as low paid or who are dependent on social welfare payments, I remind the Deputy that the Government's priority has been firmly focused on protecting the most vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">I have continued in successive budgets to increase the rates of social welfare payments significantly.  In budget 2007, social welfare increases ranged from over 8% to over 12% in weekly rates.  Thus, even when compared with the inflation outturn for 2007, these increases ensured that those in receipt of, and reliant upon, social welfare payments will have seen real net gains in 2007.  Budget 2008 provides for social welfare increases of between 6% and 7% in weekly rates, again ensuring that those in most need should be more than insulated against the effects of inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The changes to the tax system introduced in this year's budget continue to ensure that all those on the minimum wage are exempt from tax in 2008.  In total, some 878,100 earners, that is almost two out of every five earners, are outside the tax net, as compared to 380,000, or one in four, in 1997.  In addition, the income of the average worker in 2008, estimated at approximately €34,000 per annum, is placed well outside liability to the higher rate of tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">In addition to ensuring continued increases in the living standards of those relying on social welfare payments and the lower paid, I have also acted to provide extra support to mortgage holders.  Following the improvements in budget 2008, those with mortgages can avail of mortgage interest relief, which currently applies at 20%, and to a ceiling of €10,000 for a single person, or €20,000 for married or widowed persons who are first-time buyers for the initial seven years of their mortgage, and €3,000 and €6,000 for all others.  The current level of mortgage interest relief for married first-time buyers is sufficient to cover the interest arising on a mortgage of up to approximately €400,000 over 35 years at an interest rate of 5%, which is well above the average mortgage.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">In summary, in order to build on the policies of the previous Government, I have continued to bring forward policies designed to protect those on lower incomes from the impact of inflation.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_122">With regard to assessing the differential impact of inflation on certain families, has the Minister any figures for the number of children and families experiencing consistent poverty and relative income poverty?  What are the trends in that area and what measures does the Minister intend to take to alleviate the difficulties and hardships experienced by families as a result of inflation and, in particular, higher fuel costs?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_67" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_123">I do not have that information.  If the Deputy puts down a specific question in that regard, I can get accurate figures for him.  In examining the causes of Irish consumer price index inflation over the past year, it is important to distinguish between external factors, which are beyond domestic policy control, and internal factors.  Externally, the single most important cause is higher mortgage interest payments due to ECB interest rate increases.  The main driver of domestic inflation has been the services sector.  It averaged 8.4% in 2007 and peaked at 9.3% year on year in March last year.  It fell back to 6.5% year on year in December and the welcome easing of inflation in this sector reflects an improved level of competition in the economy.  It is expected that the downward trend will continue in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">Would the Minister not agree that families cannot simply focus on the HICP and pretend they do not have mortgages to pay?  It is not a fair comparison.  According to the CSO, the cost of mortgages has increased by 80%, food costs have increased by 30% and the cost of child care and health has increased by 20% in the past two years.  Young families are obliged to shoulder a huge, disproportionate burden.  Is the Minister aware that the Central Bank reported that 50% of families cannot afford to buy a house?  Perhaps the Minister would discuss the affordable housing scheme with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  The thresholds under that scheme are archaic and have ceased to be effective.  Is it not necessary to consider targeted interventions at young families to deal with this?  I acknowledge the Minister did something in that regard in the budget but he is not doing enough in some areas.  He is not targeting people on low incomes who are struggling to get on the housing ladder.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_125">With regard to the question of how inflation is measured, the harmonised index is the best in terms of international comparators and knowing where we stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries.  I accept the point that when mortgage interest rate repayments are included, the CPI is higher and that these are real payments being made by real families.  A significant investment is being made in social and affordable housing.  I can bring to the attention of the Minister of State concerned, Deputy Batt O’Keeffe, any specific reforms that are required with regard to thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">The changes we have made in child benefit have been very helpful to young families with children, particularly larger families.  When one calculates the direct payments by the State in supporting young families, with child benefit and the early child care supplement, one finds in many cases that people on low but taxable income are more than compensated for the taxes being paid.  Due to the way the social welfare system interacts with the tax system, many families are in a far better position in terms of the burden placed on them than was the case ten or 15 years ago.  Examples of that can be seen in various Budget Statements over the years.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">When the Governor of the Central Bank attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, he said that rents in the private housing sector have increased by 11% over the past year.  The Tánaiste is aware that many people are being forced into renting because they cannot afford to buy a house.  They might be able to afford to spend €1,600 or €1,700 a month on a mortgage, but they cannot afford to buy a house as a result of the increases in mortgage rates.  Is the Tánaiste concerned about the current high rent levels?  Does he welcome the benefits which are accruing to landlords and investors as a result of rent increases?  Those increases are affecting young people who have just started their first job.  What is the Tánaiste's approach to this issue?  Does he have any measures in mind that would help to make rent more affordable?  Local authorities now have to pay higher rents through the community welfare officers' rent subsidy scheme, for example.  Does the Tánaiste welcome the higher rents which are being paid to his friends in the construction industry?  Would he like rents to be lower and more affordable so ordinary families can be housed?</p>

            <p eId="para_128">Does the Tánaiste agree that his ability to take steps to combat increases in inflation is constrained by the cession of more fiscal sovereignty to the European Union?  Does he accept that the ability of the State to reduce the burden of inflation on those on low and medium-sized incomes, for example by reducing the regressive VAT burden, is constrained by EU directives?</p>

            <p eId="para_129">I contend strongly, in response to Deputy Morgan, that Ireland's adoption of the euro, which is a source of stability by comparison with other international currencies, has helped to protect us from much of the recent turbulence on the financial, equity and currency markets.  We get more protection by sharing our sovereignty with others, on the basis of a co-ordinated economic policy and a common currency, than we would get if we were on our own.  Deputy Morgan might not recall that various predatory attacks were made on the Irish pound in the early 1990s and our reserves position was seriously disrupted as a result.  Interest rates had to be increased by up to 50% overnight to protect our currency.  In this day and age, there is a more enlightened view of sovereignty.  We live in a global village, with transnational problems, in which sovereignty can be shared.  It is far better to work with our EU partners to develop a co-ordinated economic policy, which leads in turn to a strong currency in Europe.  Ireland's full and committed participation in the European Union, on foot of the establishment of the Single Market, is the best guarantee of a modern and sovereign Ireland into the future.  We can share sovereignty.</p>

I have provided a means of paying all interest on a mortgage of €400,000 over 35 years at 5%, which I hope will serve as a significant inducement or attraction to many families to regard the purchase of a house, or the taking of equity in their own homes, as a better prospect than staying in the rental market.  Nobody wants rents to increase if such increases are likely to cause hard-pressed families to endure additional hardship.

         the number of Revenue Commissioners staff and the time allocated to working in joint investigation units with the Department of Social and Family Affairs; the amount of additional allowances payable; the number receiving those additional allowances for each of the years 2000 to 2007; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_85" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_143">I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the official complement of joint investigation unit officers is 15, with officers working to varying time allocations.  The number of officers on joint investigation unit duties at the beginning of 2008 was nine.  They spend between 25% and 100% of their time on joint investigation unit duties.  An allowance of €5,954 is paid to higher executive officers and executive officers for full-time joint investigation unit duties, with <i>pro rata</i> amounts for those working 50% or 25% of their time on such duties.  There has been a great deal of movement of officers in recent years as a result of promotions, transfers and decentralisation etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">It is not possible to give the exact number of joint investigation unit officers who served between 2000 and 2007.  However, I can outline the number of officers who, according to the records available to me, were in receipt of the joint investigation unit allowance at some point during the years in question.  There was the equivalent of 14 full-time posts in 2000; there was the equivalent of 16.5 full-time posts in 2001; there was the equivalent of 16.75 full-time posts in 2002; there was the equivalent of 15.75 full-time posts in 2003; there was the equivalent of 16.25 full-time posts in 2004; there was the equivalent of ten full-time posts in 2005; there was the equivalent of 11.75 full-time posts in 2006; and there was the equivalent of 11 full-time posts in 2007.  The Revenue Commissioners are in the process of filling the vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">The Revenue Commissioners have decided, in the context of the expanded labour market and with the support of the Department of Finance, to increase the number of joint investigation unit officers to 32, all of whom will be full time.  This more than exceeds the commitment under Towards 2016.  It is intended that the officers will be assigned to joint investigation unit duties by the end of February of this year.  The bulk of the work to be carried out by the officers will be project work with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the National Employment Rights Authority.  They will act on information received from those bodies.  Their work will include work previously done by audit staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">Given that the number of people working in the public service has been soaring in recent years, does the Minister agree that it is an indictment of the Government that the number of officials assigned to these important joint investigations has decreased so dramatically?  I remind the House of some of the areas which are investigated.  Some rogue employers who are not properly registered do not complete their tax and insurance dealings in a proper manner.  More importantly, the capital of some businesses might come from illegal activities, such as money laundering, particularly in the drugs field.  The work of joint investigation units in such areas should be co-ordinated with the work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We know about people in various parts of Limerick and Dublin who have no visible means of support other than social welfare, but are able to do their houses up beautifully.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">If we are to be serious about tackling rogue employers and the godfathers of crime and drugs in this country, surely we must investigate how such people managed to accumulate vast assets.  Such efforts, with the policing work of the Garda, should be at the heart of the attack.  We have to ensure that there is co-operation between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.  Al Capone was finally sent to jail in the United States when he was convicted of tax evasion, rather than the other crimes in which he was involved.  Given that crime and illegal activity is at unbelievable levels in various parts of the country, is there any chance that the Minister will take a personal interest in this matter?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_148">This type of work is not just carried out by officers from the joint investigation unit, it is also done by compliance officers from the Revenue Commissioners, who actively engage in similar duties as part of their routine daily audit and compliance activities in sectors like construction, private security and entertainment.  There has been an ongoing exchange of information with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The work of joint investigation unit officers forms a small part of the response of the Revenue Commissioners to the problems posed by the hidden economy.  The Revenue Commissioners employ more than 1,000 audit, investigation and compliance officers, who engage in outdoor work to combat tax evasion.  Such officers continued to detect tax evasion when the joint investigation unit complement was under strength.  Site visits have been enhanced by improvements in information technology and various administrative changes.  In 2006 there were 1,615 site visits; the number of unregistered cases was 1,188; the number of subcontractors reclassified as employees was 447; the number of additional taxes registered was 2,479; the number of C2s withdrawn was 712; and the number of C2s refused was 456.  With regard to construction-related audits, of the 14,286 audits conducted last year, 3,807 were construction-related.  This is an indication of the level of activity of a far broader cohort than simply the JIU officers, whose numbers are being increased to 32 by the end of this month.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_88" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_150">The issues raised by the Deputy fall within the remit of the Financial Regulator.  The Financial Regulator's annual report for 2006 identified a total of approximately €167 million relating to overcharging issues dating from the early 1990s to the present.  The most recent information available from the Financial Regulator is that 36 financial service providers and over 250 individual charging issues were involved.  My Department has asked the Financial Regulator to compile updated information in the format requested by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">This area has been a major focus of the work of the Financial Regulator since its establishment in 2003.  In responding to these issues, the main priority has been to ensure that all affected customers receive full and speedy refunds and that systems and controls are put in place to deal with the issues that led to overcharging so that future errors may be eliminated or minimised.  This has been reflected in the substantial progress made in the reimbursement programmes and a decline in the number of new charging issues reported to the Financial Regulator, as financial service providers have adopted a much more rigorous approach to their internal controls, IT system processes and compliance procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The Financial Regulator is closely monitoring the reimbursement programmes to confirm that they are carried out fully in line with the general principles established by the Financial Regulator in 2005.  These ensure that financial service providers make all reasonable efforts to make refunds, with appropriate interest, to all customers who have been affected by overcharging and that the financial institution concerned cannot benefit in any way from amounts that cannot be repaid.  Details of the main reimbursement programmes are published in the Financial Regulator's annual report.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">It is important to note that the high number of overcharging issues identified is largely due to system reviews and allocation of additional compliance resources by credit institutions and insurers following the establishment of the Financial Regulator in 2003 as well as the reviews initiated by the Financial Regulator and the commencement of its customer-oriented on site inspections at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">In addition, under the Financial Regulator's consumer protection code, which came into full effect on 1 July 2007, regulated entities must speedily, efficiently and fairly correct any charging or pricing errors and notify affected consumers of any charging or pricing errors that may have a negative impact on the cost of a service or the value of a product provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">The whole regulatory structure for Irish financial services was reformed with the establishment of the Financial Regulator, with its statutory consumer protection mandate, in 2003.  The progress made on this issue is therefore a reflection of the work of the Financial Regulator in implementing a strong principles-based supervisory approach, in fostering a compliance culture in the financial services industry and in promoting and safeguarding the interests of consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">I wish to ask the Minister about a new area of charging under which people are being fleeced by financial institutions.  A number of operators have given loans to people living in local authority estates and affordable housing, encouraging them to extend their existing mortgages to include car loans, credit card debts and other financial commitments and including some money left over to spend on, for example, a new kitchen.  If a customer defaults at any level, even getting into arrears for one or two months, the financial institution will add penalties and interest charges which rise rapidly.  If it takes the customer to court, astronomical legal fees are added.  In cases that have come to my attention, debts of €6,000 have rapidly escalated to €20,000 to €30,000.  I am told by the Financial Regulator that these institutions may not yet be regulated.  Will the Minister undertake to the House to make personal investigations into these cases?  They are coming before the courts in increasing numbers.  It is a way of fleecing young couples who have been sold products by people who in some instances are little better than moneylenders.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">I will bring this matter to the attention of the Office of the Financial Regulator as the Deputy requested and consider in what way its remit can be used to deal with institutions that are not in compliance with the Consumer Credit Act and the various consumer protection codes, which apply to all resident financial institutions.  Some months ago we dealt with a Bill in which these issues were taken into account and in which we tried to provide for regulatory oversight of these institutions.  All I can do is undertake to bring this to the attention of the Financial Regulator.  The Deputy stated that she had done so already.  In my discussions I will ask the representatives of the Office of the Financial Regulator to let me know the extent of the problem and possible remedies.</p>

For example, overcharging of up to €500 would attract a penalty of €500 multiplied by a certain amount, resulting in a sliding-scale penalty system.  Has the Minister considered such a system?</p>

            <p eId="para_160">The Financial Regulator has various powers which involve reimbursement and ensuring that these issues do not recur.  In addition, if anything beyond the civil code has taken place, information will be passed on to the Garda and the fraud squad for follow-on investigation.  We have in place a Financial Services Ombudsman who has proven effective in individual cases in which he used his statutory powers to ensure that people are dealt with fairly.  Where there have been transgressions by financial institutions against individual clients, effective remedies are available under existing legislation.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         his views on whether subsidising bio-fuels represents a cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
        [2100/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_95" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_164">I stated previously that taxation can play a part in attaining environmental objectives, including the promotion of energy efficiency and the reduction of emissions.  Using taxation as a mechanism to subsidise activity that yields overall benefits to the economy is a tool that has been used by successive Administrations, often delivering very positive results.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">To promote the development of bio-fuels in Ireland, I provided for an appropriate excise relief scheme in the Finance Act 2006.  Under the scheme, bio-fuels produced under approved projects are exempt from excise duty.  This serves to reduce the additional costs associated with the production of bio-fuels and consequently allows them to compete with conventional fossil fuels.  With regard to whether this approach represents a cost-effective way of reducing emissions, I will point out that this relief is in place for a period of five years to assist in the development of a domestic bio-fuels industry.  Long-term general excise reliefs are not anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">In this regard the Deputy might wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote bio-fuels.  To provide further market certainty and encourage projects of scale, the Government has signalled its intention to move to a bio-fuels obligation by 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual sales.  The obligation will fall under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_96">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_167">I know the Minister has seen an in-house report by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission which raised considerable scepticism about the general EU thrust towards bio-fuels as a solution.  It made a number of points.  One point was that the use of biomass to generate power was more effective than its use in transport and that some technologies for creating bio-fuels produce more carbon than burning fossil fuels.  It raised other concerns that the EU was rigging the market in favour of an untried technology.  There is scepticism on how effective and well-grounded is the target.  While everybody wants to see this pursued and a successful bio-fuel strategy will provide good domestic opportunities, we want to be sure we are building a strategy on firm, long-term ground.  Will the Minister examine these concerns and get the authority of Government to investigate this so that we have a strategy if we decide to pursue this target?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_97" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_168">I have not read the report to which the Deputy refers but will have it examined.  The European Commission strongly supports the use of these fuels and recently the commissioner with responsibility for this area highlighted the need to support bio-fuels because they are the most immediately feasible way of slowing the growth in greenhouse emissions in the transport sector and reducing our dependence on imported oil.  The only alternative to bio-fuels is oil, which is a shrinking source of energy.  Bio-fuels provide a development opportunity for poorer countries.  However, I take the Deputy's point.  Some years ago the concept that bio-fuels or energy crops might provide an alternative or supplementary source of income for farmers was fashionable in Irish agriculture circles.  With rising grain prices people may return to greater production of grain, which they were getting out of, and getting out of tillage.  That may change as the economics of food changes worldwide.  I take Deputy Bruton's point that we must monitor this constantly and that what once looked like an excellent opportunity may not be as great as envisaged when circumstances change.  I will have the matter examined.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_169">Is the Minister aware that one of the impacts of the emphasis on bio-fuels in its current form is a large projected increase in food prices worldwide, a shortage of grains for food use and the impact this will have on some of the poorest people in the developing world and poor families in the EU and Ireland?  The Minister is a member of the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change.  Has that committee any mechanism to study and reach a balanced conclusion on the advantages and disadvantages of bio-fuels, particularly their negative impact on the Third World in stripping rain forests and causing grain prices for food use to rise dramatically?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_99" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_170">The White Paper on energy policy, which is the blueprint for the development of Ireland's energy sector, provides for looking at renewables, bio-fuels and alternative sources of fuel for a more competitive energy sector in Ireland.  I made the point that with the big switch of grain to bio-fuel production in the United States and the drought in Australia grain prices are rising again after many fallow years.  This is a benefit for Irish farmers and a factor in how attractive energy crops may be for the primary agriculture production sector in the future.  I see the question as a front-line issue for the Minister with responsibility for environment and energy on how he is promoting the White Paper objectives on energy policy.  The Cabinet sub-committee is drawing up scenarios on the impact of the Commission's proposal on greenhouse gas emissions and the reduction it seeks from us, and this will be the priority in the months ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I would like to ask the Taoiseach a number of questions on money and related matters, the disappearance of it and the use of it.  I did not organise that response from the Visitors Gallery.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the rest of the Cabinet have blown most of the wealth generated over the last ten years, turned a budgetary surplus of €2.8 billion into a project loss of €5 billion this year and preside over a property market in serious decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Deputy Cowen's budget for 2008 was based on a moderate slowing of economic growth from 4.8% to 2.8% for this year with a projected moderate slowing of day-to-day spending.  However, since he presented that budget the growth forecast for all our major importers — the UK, the eurozone and the United States — has been significantly downgraded and this puts us in a position very different from Deputy Cowen's forecast.  The latest figures show a further decline and fall in exports.  The Minister for Finance's reluctant and half-baked measures on stamp duty for the housing sector have done nothing to maintain confidence in the construction industry where house prices are falling by €1,500 per month and where the latest realistic projection is that we might reach 30,000 new starts this year.  Consumer confidence has fallen to a five-year low, the Irish stock market has fallen seriously and people have genuine concerns about pensions.  Irish banks have revealed that they are exposed to a debt of €140 billion due to property speculators, which puts them more in hock than the Japanese banks were before their crisis in the 1980s.  International investors are fleeing this country and there is a dissipation of confidence in the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">One could be accused of national sabotage for talking about this, but it is necessary that we have responses from the head of Government and the Minister for Finance on the plans they have to restore domestic and international confidence in the Irish economy regarding the issues over which they have control.  They are not responsible for such issues as the fall in the American stock exchange, however certain issues at home have changed since the Minister presented his budget before Christmas.  What is the response of the Government?  What action will it take?  What plan has it to restore domestic and international confidence in our economy?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_102">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_176">In the first week of December when we presented the budget we mentioned the downside risks.  The Minister for Finance made it clear that we were examining a number of concerns about 2008.  That was one of the reasons we put a fiscal stimulus of 1.5% into the budget, again reformed the stamp duty regime and revised the size of our capital programme to ensure we continue to inject investment into the economy at record levels and higher than our EU partners to sustain and maintain fiscal stimulus during 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">It is true, as the world knows, that there are a number of difficulties.  It is quite clear that the global economy is characterised now by greater uncertainty than in the third quarter of last year and is certainly worse than the fourth quarter.  There are a number of issues which we must take account of, including the potential for further euro appreciation against the US dollar or sterling and the rising probability of a house-production recession in the United States, with knock-on effects in the wider US economy and possibly the global economy.  These issues are being discussed daily.  The possibility also exists for further oil price increases, although they have gone up and down in the last month.  The financial market difficulties which Deputy Kenny mentioned could persist and could spill over and affect the real economy.  On the domestic side, there is a risk of a potentially steeper decline in new housing output.  These are all issues that we must be clear on.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">We have taken action already in the budget, as I have said, regarding the capital programme to inject resources into the economy.  The housing market here is slower.  I was continually answering questions about overheating in the market some years ago, but there is a correction taking place in that market.  Some 88,000 units were built a few years ago.  The Department of Finance figure is 55,000 for this year, although the view is that after the correction, we will move back into a more sustained position of building 60,000 units a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">In the meantime, there is, and will continue to be, a decline in employment in the construction sector.  That has already been happening.  It happened in the last quarter and will continue into this quarter.  However, that does not take away from the huge amount of activity in other areas of the construction sector.  The capital programme includes, in one form or another, road building, capital development in health and education as well as infrastructural developments and incentives in other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">As the Tánaiste said on budget day, 2008 will be a more difficult year to manage.  However, notwithstanding all of that, the projected growth rate is still in the order of 3%, which is better than many of our competitors.  When we look at 2007, we see it was a strong year for economic growth and employment, with strong outturns.  We have had surpluses for ten of the past 11 years.  I am sure I do not have to remind Deputy Kenny of the strong position of the national finances, whether in terms of debt, the current budget deficit or the fact that we are funding a major capital investment programme from our own revenues, which very few countries in the world could do and we could never do in the past.  These are all points on the plus side but it is a year for careful, close management of the economy.  As myself and the Tánaiste have been saying for the past few months, this requires close management, close watching of the international situation and the utilisation of our strengths.  One of our strengths has been that we are a flexible economy.  Our exports are not in decline, as Deputy Kenny maintained, but are on the rise.  We must manage these issues in a careful and prudent fashion during this current year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_181">Nobody denies that the fundamentals of the Irish economy are sound but the perception across the country is that the Government managed to get back into government, climbed into the State cars, awarded themselves between €36,000 and €38,000, closed the doors and said that everything was going to be fine.  That is not the position.  The situation is very different now from when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, presented his budget just before Christmas.  There is clearly an unease and a depth of concern out there and a loss of confidence in a range of sectors in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Other governments in Washington, Paris, London and Rome have attempted to address the challenges faced by their countries and their people.  They have told the people of their plans and decisions.  What has this Government done?  It has done nothing, except say it will be fine on the day, whether one is whistling past the tenth storey on the way down to ground zero, or not.  Ministers say, in clichéd terms, that it will be fine; we will ride out the storm.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I want to know what the Government has decided in respect of dealing with the situation as we find it at the end of January 2008.  I will make three proposals to the Taoiseach in that regard.  I ask him to direct that there be a 2% efficiency audit carried out across every Department, which, over a four year period, would yield approximately €8 billion to spend on tax cuts or on other areas.  Will the Taoiseach direct that there be a real, radical overhaul of the 1,000 quangos at national and local level, which have led to a bureaucratic and administrative bulge which is not delivering the public service for which the people pay their taxes?  I further ask him to direct FÁS to carry out a national programme of upskilling and retraining.  One must look at the situation in Kilkenny recently and the situation in Arklow today, where workers are being made redundant because of the consequences of globalised decisions from multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">It is not just workers who are unfortunately made redundant who require retraining and upskilling.  The nature of the marketplace, with sudden changes of direction by companies, means that workers <i> in situ </i>also need access to a clear, defined programme of retraining and upskilling.  The Taoiseach must direct that FÁS does that now, so that people will understand that the Government is not just sitting in its ivory tower in the Cabinet room but has a clear plan in response to this economic lack of confidence, which is causing so much concern to many families.  I have made three specific proposals which the Taoiseach can take charge of and direct.  Is he prepared to do so?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_104">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_185">Deputy Kenny asked me three sets of questions, the first of which concerned what governments are doing internationally, that is, what Presidents Bush, Sarkozy and others have been doing in the past few weeks.  In response, that is precisely what we did in the first week of December last.  The Tánaiste announced a budget that allocated 6% of GDP to a capital programme, amounting to an injection of €8.6 billion into the Irish economy this year, which is a record high.  The programme is mainly funded by our current budget surpluses and will make sure that we can drive the economy in a wide range of areas while the international slowdown occurs.  It will have the effect of a financial and fiscal stimulus of approximately 1.5% this year.  That is exactly the type of action that international governments are now looking at, but thankfully we moved on it two months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">With regard to the efficiency review, which the Fine Gael spokesman on finance also raised, I welcome the fact that in the Tánaiste's speech, he moved the next phase of the efficiency review, to ensure that we do not have any waste and that we can gain more efficiencies from our staff and across the range our services to inject more money into the economy.  We have continued public sector reform in every way, whether it is in the benchmarking report or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">On the matter of the agencies, we have already stated that we are in the process of reviewing them.  They will all have their own difficulties but I will welcome support when they come.  On FÁS, we have a national skills strategy and a strategy on science, technology and innovation.  In the current national development plan, we are investing €8.2 billion.  I agree that we must upskill our workers.  I have every sympathy and concern and will do all I can with regard to Allergan.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has already had a meeting to discuss the situation and we will do all we can.  This decision is based on the Costa Rican plant, a newer and more modern plant that has spare capacity and where the wages and salaries are far lower than ours.  It sees a competitive advantage for itself in the world market in moving to that plant.  Obviously, this creates problems for us.  It is maintaining other sectors of its industry in Ireland, but it is not maintaining its cosmetic surgery and reconstructive plants.  That is a severe shock and hardship to the individuals involved, but we have a period to try to deal with the issue over the next year or 18 months.  We took action today to try to assist and work with the workers of Allergan to deal with the situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_188">This country needs to move on from the Taoiseach's problems with the Mahon tribunal and his tax affairs.  Since the House last met six weeks ago, which is a disgrace, we have had turmoil in the markets with consequential worries about jobs, earnings and pensions, hundreds of workers were told that they will lose their jobs, a report detailed rising crime figures, there have been continuing problems in our hospitals and accident and emergency departments, there has been a cystic fibrosis controversy, we do not have the report on what occurred in terms of the women who were given the all clear in Portlaoise but who were called back and, after yesterday, a family is facing financial ruin because the parents tried to get their child an education.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">During the break, there were a number of newspaper stories on the Taoiseach, his tax affairs and his inability to get a tax clearance certificate, which no parliament worth its name could ignore on its first day back.  In an effort to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond to these issues and to enable us to move on, I wish to put to him a number of specific questions arising from the reports.  It was reported that the Taoiseach made a voluntary disclosure of his tax affairs whereas the Revenue Commissioners are reported to have stated that he did not.  Did the Taoiseach make a voluntary disclosure?  If so, does it not follow that there is an acceptance by the Taoiseach that his tax affairs were not in order?  Where does that leave the tax clearance certificate that he applied for and received in 2002?</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The Taoiseach stated that the Revenue Commissioners cannot finalise his tax affairs until the Mahon tribunal has reported.  That does not appear to be the way in which the Revenue Commissioners dealt with the tax affairs of Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry while issues pertaining to them were being examined by the Moriarty tribunal.  Have the Revenue Commissioners confirmed to the Taoiseach that they will not finalise his tax affairs until the Mahon tribunal has reported?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_106">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I am very glad to answer the questions and then, as the Deputy has suggested, we can move on from these issues.  I will answer them comprehensively.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Regarding other issues, from the Government's perspective, I finished Government meetings with my colleagues on the Sunday of the weekend of 23 December and the Government resumed in full session on 4 January.  I admit that was a few days off, but I do not think the Government went away for any length of time from the issues with which the State must deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">The full Government was there and has been dealing with all the issues mentioned by Deputy Gilmore and many more in that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">If I recall the questions exactly, I am advised that, in the professional opinion of my tax advisers, I am fully tax compliant.  I made a voluntary disclosure based on their advice.  For the avoidance of doubt, comprehensive and detailed submissions were made to Revenue.  I understand that these are being considered by Revenue as part of the normal process.  A voluntary disclosure was the normal process, not an acceptance that there was anything wrong.  It was on that basis that I was advised to do it.  Much of what has appeared in the media concerning my tax affairs in that period was based on leaked documentation, much of it a long way out of date.  For legal and professional reasons, neither I nor my advisers have been in a position to respond about the accuracy or completeness of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">It is not correct, and if I said so, I was not correct — I cannot recall if I said it, but I did not say, or if I did, I did not mean to say it — that these issues could not be dealt with until the end of the Mahon tribunal.  That is not what Revenue said.  It said that it was part of the normal process of dealing with these issues.  It and the Standards in Public Office Commission believe, and it is similar under the law, that while there is no tax clearance certificate, it is possible to deal with the other process while the issue is ongoing.  Hopefully, those issues will be cleared up as soon as Revenue can do so.  There is no question that I or my tax advisers have not comprehensively answered.  There is no outstanding Revenue matter of which we are aware.  We have answered every single question it has asked us.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">I will need to check the written record of the House to unravel the quadruple negative the Taoiseach gave in respect of what the Revenue Commissioners did or did not accept from him.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Regarding the Government's performance, I note the Taoiseach's statement that it was back on duty on 4 January.  Unfortunately, we have nothing to show for it.  We are back after a six week break and there is no legislation before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">We will need to examine the written record to parse the Taoiseach's exact statement, but there is no parsing necessary in a headline that appeared in the <i>Irish Mail on Sunday</i> of 30 December, which stated: “Bertie lied about tax”.  I cannot recall reading a newspaper headline about a political leader in this State that was so blunt and used the word the Ceann Comhairle will not allow me to use in the House.  I assume the Taoiseach rejects the assertion that he lied about his tax affairs.  Has he taken action arising from this headline, the type of action most people would take or initiate were such a headline printed about them?</p>

            <p eId="para_224">The total cost to date of the McCracken tribunal is €6.56 million.  A token provision for 2008 was made to cover potential claims arising from the McCracken tribunal.  Two of the parties who were granted representation before the tribunal have not yet claimed their costs.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office has no method of estimating how much the claims might amount to, should they ever be submitted.  However, it cannot be assumed that these parties will not claim their costs at some future point.  They are entitled to these costs and prudent provision must be made in the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">As regards the Moriarty tribunal, the total cost incurred by my Department since 1997 up to 31 December 2007 was €30,466,497.  For 2007, up to 31 December, the figure was €4,154,564.  It is not possible at this stage to estimate the final costs.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_226">I understand that the amount in the Estimates for the McCracken tribunal is €1.  Presumably, the two witnesses or participants in the tribunal are likely to claim a bit more than that if they claim.  Is there any estimate of what the likely claim for costs will be?</p>
            <p eId="para_227">According to reports prior to Christmas, Judge Moriarty was planning to publish his report in January.  However, there has been some speculation that some of those referred to in the report may take legal action to block its publication.  What does the Taoiseach know about the publication of the Moriarty tribunal report and when we are likely to see it?</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Over the Christmas period, the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers were very vocal about the costs associated with tribunals.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that legal costs — the scale of fees with lawyers — were set by his Government?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_129">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_229">The figure of €1 is present in the Estimates to keep the subhead open pending whatever might happen in respect of the two outstanding claims.  Due to the passage of time, there is some thought that these may not be claimed although the two parties are entitled to claim them.  A case arising from the beef tribunal is before the courts where the State is arguing that the Statute of Limitations applies.  The Office of the Attorney General would be of the view that it would apply where a similar situation arises.  Until that situation is clarified, the token provision remains.  It will remain until that case is dealt with.  If the case is dealt with successfully, we will probably remove it from the Estimates but it remains there pending the resolution of that case.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">In respect of the Moriarty tribunal, I do not have a date.  It has been the view for a considerable period of time that Judge Moriarty wants to complete this work and his fine report.  Obviously, there are considerations around some legal actions.  I have no more information on those than Deputy Gilmore.  I understand that Judge Moriarty hopes to conclude it as soon as he can.  Obviously, he must take some of those considerations into account and that is the only issue outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">Following the work done by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, some years ago, a number of the tribunals did not move to the new cost structure.  Hopefully, 2008 will see the tribunal into the Donegal case and the Moriarty tribunal come to an end.  We did not change the cost structure, including that for the Mahon tribunal, because of the time involved.  They were set by the Government but we want to bring them all to a conclusion based on the fee structure put in place.  Those fee structures are different because some of the tribunals moved to the new fee structure while others did not.  For future tribunals, we have laid down a new structure which is very different from and less costly to the Exchequer than the higher structure.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_130">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_232">The Taoiseach makes it sound like the tribunals decide what they will be paid.  Will he confirm that it is the Government, specifically the Attorney General, which agrees the scale of fees with the lawyers at the various tribunals?  I will return to the Mahon tribunal.  In 2004, the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, described the scales of fees then applying as astronomical and said that the gravy train had gone on long enough.  He announced new scales of fees which would apply specifically to the Mahon tribunal and, I think, to the Moriarty tribunal at that stage.  There were various stages by which these scales of fees were supposed to come into effect, for example, the autumn of 2004 and February and September of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">On each occasion that these new scales of fees were supposed to come into effect, the Government changed it and allowed the existing fees to continue.  It is the height of hypocrisy for Ministers to bellyache, which they have done for the past number of months now, about the fees paid to lawyers at the Mahon tribunal when the Government set those fees.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the legal fees being paid to lawyers at the various tribunals were set and approved by the Government?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_234">The answer to that question is a simple "Yes".  All fees have been negotiated and arranged by the Government.  The point I was making related to when the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and the then Attorney General set about negotiating new fee structures with the tribunals.  We had about eight tribunals in one form or another pursuing different investigations at that stage.  In the case of some tribunals that were near an end, they allowed the fees to remain while they wrapped up.  There was a view in those that remained on the highest structure that their end was imminent, which is why they allowed the fees to remain as they were.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">The new fee structure has been implemented for a number of tribunals, some of which have come to an end, while the Breen and Buchanan tribunal has only begun.  The new fee structure is in place for those tribunals.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">Has there been any recovery of costs in respect of the McCracken tribunal, given that some of those interviewed were less than comprehensive in their co-operation with the tribunal?  What efforts have been made and what recovery has been brought about?  Is there any report on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_237">In respect of the Moriarty tribunal, I did not catch the clarity of the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Gilmore.  The tax business of the two principals dealt with by the Moriarty tribunal was dealt with while the tribunal was carrying out its work.  I did not catch what the Taoiseach said with regard to his business with the Revenue Commissioners while the Mahon tribunal is ongoing.  What is the view of the Taoiseach on that?</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_243">Does the Taoiseach still agree with his statement, at the time of the publication of the McCracken tribunal report, that "the acceptance of large gifts or payments or personal benefits in a surreptitious manner or the large scale evasion of tax and exchange control regulations by even one or two senior serving politicians or members of Government is deeply damaging to trust in politics"?  There has been much criticism by the Taoiseach and other Ministers of the Mahon tribunal for the scope of its investigations, its duration and cost.  There is a credibility deficit because there are pertinent questions about many other tribunals but we have not heard these criticisms of other tribunals in which the Taoiseach was not directly involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">Regarding costs, can the Taoiseach clearly and exactly spell out the steps that have been taken and the measures introduced to reduce the cost of tribunals, especially the exorbitant daily rate paid to counsel?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_138">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_245">The new rates or set fees paid to a senior counsel will be based on the current annual salary of a High Court judge, plus 20% in respect of pension contributions.  Related payments will be paid to other legal staff, including barristers and solicitors.  The new measures will drastically reduce the legal costs of new tribunals or those existing tribunals that have already changed and where the new rates will apply from a future date.  The new rates represent less than 40% of the maximum current rate paid to the counsel of tribunal inquiry.  The rates are at a different level to what has been the case for the past ten years.  Does that answer Deputy Ó Caoláin's question?</p>

            <p eId="para_248">Regarding criticisms of the scope of the investigations, the duration of the Mahon tribunal and its cost, many of these questions are also pertinent to other tribunals yet there is not the same focus from the Taoiseach or his Ministers.  The Taoiseach has answered in part, referring to what has been done or what was proposed in respect of the curtailment of costs of tribunals.  The Taoiseach signalled the introduction of new daily rates applying to counsel, which were subsequently deferred, deferred again and are not applied in critical cases, including the Mahon tribunal.  In 2004 I noted that the Minister for Finance indicated that the cost to date of all inquiries, completed and current, was then some €440 million.  Can the Taoiseach indicate the updated figure?  What do we know of the overall outlay of the State commitment, not only what is paid but what has been clocked up and will be due for payment in the future?  I fear the figure will have more than multiplied the €440 million indicated by the then Minister for Finance in 2004.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_249">On the general point, the Commissions of Investigation Act sets out clearly the best consideration of how we should deal with these issues in the future.  With the new fee structure, that would make a dramatic change to the speed and type of investigation and how issues are dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_250">Personally and as Taoiseach, I have appeared before the children's abuse tribunal, the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals and possibly another but I cannot remember which one.  The point has been made about the length of time that passes from urgent business to the end date.  Regarding the issue that we will debate later, collusion, a point made by all relatives is that they do not want the State to get into a long process.  They want to focus on the issue that can be dealt with in a number of months, without building up major costs to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_251">To the end of 2007, the total cost to the Exchequer of completed and sitting tribunals of inquiry and other public inquiries is €323.17 million, not including the third party costs that will emanate.</p>

He promised that they would come into effect in September 2006.  In July 2006, the Government made a decision, announced in a one line statement on 13 July 2006, that the existing level of fees would continue for both the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals.  What was the cost of that decision?  If that decision had not been made and the lower fees had applied, how much would the State have saved in fees?</p>

            <p eId="para_265">My next question is on the recovery of some of the moneys paid out and some of it yet to be paid out when the third party costs come to be assessed.  Some time ago, the Government promised legislation on corruption and to establish an agency similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau, the purpose of which was to recover the ill-gotten gains of people who had either been paid bribes or benefited from corrupt decisions.  Is it still intended to introduce this legislation?  Is it intended to recover moneys from those paid bribes?  Are there any plans to recover from those who benefited from corrupt decisions, such as landowners who had land rezoned as a result of a corrupt decision of a local authority?  Is there any intention to introduce legislation which will recover some of the gains these people made in order to defray the considerable cost incurred by the taxpayer in the inquiries into these matters?</p>

            <p eId="para_306">One matter that has stuck in people's craws is the method by which this recommendation has been accepted by the Government. <i>The Economist</i> recently produced a table showing that the Taoiseach is the highest paid Head of Government position in the western world.  It is higher paid than that of the offices of the US President, the German Chancellor and the British Prime Minister.  For a country with a population of 4.5 million, people are asking why the Government could take on these pay recommendations, particularly when there are concerns about the economy, loss and lack of confidence in it and pension provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_307">What positions in the private sector were those of Ministers compared to for these massive increases of €36,000 to €38,000?  I admit they will not be accepted until 2010.  However, how was a comparison arrived at that makes the Taoiseach the highest paid political leader in the western world and all his Ministers behind him accepting a €38,000 pay increase when workers are being asked to tighten their belts?  Is it because the Cabinet has become so far removed from what is happening on the street?</p>
            <p eId="para_308">The nurses had two serious issues prior to the general election concerning a percentage pay increase and a shorter working week.  They were told the benchmarking process would deal with them.  When they entered the benchmarking process, they were informed it could not deal with these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_309">The Taoiseach has set up a position where the next pay talks will be very controversial and difficult.  Benchmarking, supposed to be the panacea for the nurses' particular problems, did not turn out that way.  Despite the publicity of putting the increases aside until 2009 or whenever, the Cabinet has accepted these pay increases without any performance-related audit.</p>
            <p eId="para_310">The other night on national television, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, admitted he did not know how much money was allocated to the HSE for mental health care and was not in a position to get answers from it concerning this.  Only recently, there was an unfortunate tragedy in which a young man was stabbed 80 times by a person who on three occasions sought and could not get admission to a psychiatric hospital.  Due to a debate on a national radio programme, a person put up €100,000 for an operation for a young girl from County Cork, despite the existence of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_311">What comparator was used to recommend the pay for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers increase by €36,000 to €38,000?  Why was no performance audit built into these increases?  Will the Taoiseach accept that by trying to get away with this, the next round of pay talks will be exceptionally difficult?</p>

            <p eId="para_312">The Deputy made a number of points.  I think I answered a lot of this in a Question Time back in November.  I think Deputy Kenny knows most of the answers to the questions he has asked.  There has been a review body for higher public servants, the Judiciary, the Garda Síochána and other senior positions, covering approximately 1,600 people, for the past 40 years.  It used to report every five years.  The last report, which was implemented, was in 1997.  The Deputy's own Government made a decision to implement it.  The increases were not very big.  That was implemented the following year by a Government that I led.  All of the increases over the 40 years have been implemented.  They are phased by the Government, which is a practice that has been followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_313">The same has happened in this case.  The review body, which is independent of Government, examines and outlines its report.  It has outlined the report.  It has given the facts itself.  It has outlined in detail the comparables and how they operate.  The last benchmarking report was five years ago.  The last report on this, was more than seven years ago.  When it is implemented it will be ten years.  It is double the length of the benchmarking report.  That is a considerable factor.  That apart, the increases recommended by the review body average 7.3%.  They range from a number of posts, which receive no increase, to one post the pay of which was increased by 36%.  That was the manager of Dublin City Council.  For approximately half of those covered, the increase is 5.5%.  They are Civil Service assistant secretaries and related posts, including university professors.</p>
            <p eId="para_314">The Government decided to phase in the increases over 18 months.  That was all of those increases.  It decided to implement the part relating to it over a three-year period and not to pay anything until a year after the report was published.  The review body's recommendations are based on comparison of the public service posts with posts in the private sector with comparable levels of duties and responsibilities.  The recommendations are based on the lower quartile of the private sector rates.  They have been further reduced by 15% to allow for the superior value of public service pensions relative to the private sector.  Regarding members of the Government and other political officeholders, the review body considered that direct comparison with the private sector was not appropriate and that the salaries of senior public servants were a more relevant comparator.</p>
            <p eId="para_315">It did not compare them with comparable posts in the private sector because it would have been too high.  Any of the quartiles that were taken would have put my salary up at €600,000.  I did not need that, I can tell the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_317">I would.  It did not do that, thank God — and I would not have taken it.  It related increases to private sector posts.  In its only reference to my post, it stated that the Chief Justice should not be paid more so it put my salary at exactly the same as the Chief Justice.  That was the comparable point — that the Chief Justice should not earn more or less that the Taoiseach.  Whether it is right or wrong, I am just saying this is the job it did.  It compared other posts.  It did that independently with actuarial advice, using Hay Management Consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_318">The last review is now already ten years ago.  The next review will probably end up in 2011 to come up in 2012.  In fairness to the political system, it will not be a matter of concern for me then.  The political system has been more than fair.  The parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Mansergh showed the level of people in the private sector in the quartile that were way above this.  That ran to several thousand of people.  I accept there are pressures and that the November figures were not as good, which is why we put it back by a year and then phased it over three years.  I do not think the Government has done anything other than take a reasonable view based on an independent report.</p>
            <p eId="para_319">The implementation of previous reports was phased and this one is phased.  We have never had as long a gap as the one leading up to this report — all of the others were five years and I think one was six.  This one will end up being 11 years in the end.  From the point of view of professional politics I do not think it is an unreasonable position.  Of course on the benchmarking report, the review body stated that regarding any increase given in benchmarking for politicians, officeholders could not get the same increase.  What happens then is that it is netted off.  The increase given in the benchmarking report is not in addition to what was given in the review body report.  Officeholders will not get that increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_320">I will just make one point, which is outside what was asked in fairness to Deputy Kenny.  Obviously I am deeply involved in the pay talks.  It is not the case that none of the issues affecting nurses was dealt with.  It looked at all the grades.  There are 21 grades, 17 that were listed plus four grades, where it believed the nurses had a substantive case that justified it and they have been awarded increases under the benchmarking report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_162">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_321">We have had two reports on public sector pay, one by the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector covering, among others, the Taoiseach and Ministers.  In his case it awarded an increase of €38,000 and in the case of some departmental secretaries it awarded increases of approximately €60,000.  We have a second report for lower-paid people in the public sector, which in many cases does not award any increase at all.  Is there not something fundamentally flawed and unfair in a system of pay determination, which results in those who are at the highest level of pay getting very substantial pay increases and those at the lowest level of pay getting no increase at all?  Do we not have a problem of low pay?  The reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Ciarán Lynch shortly before Christmas established that approximately 1.5 million taxpayers have an income of less than the €38,000 the Taoiseach will get as a pay increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_322">I challenge the idea that public sector pay should be determined by reference to the private sector.  What has been happening in the private sector for some time is that those at the top end of the pay scale are going into the stratosphere in pay terms.  There are chief executives of corporations and companies being paid more than €1 million a year.  It was recently reported that the chief executive of a bank was being paid more than €4 million a year.  Surely it is not intended for the public sector to follow that model.  If it follows that model those at the higher end will continue to rise and those at the bottom end will have their pay driven down.  In any event no comparison of that kind can be made between those in employment where monetary reward is traded off for security of employment and those in much more exposed employment where monetary reward is much higher reflecting that insecurity.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's view on the matter because we are creating two societies — those who are very highly paid and those on low pay.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_163">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_323">Broadly in the same vein, how does the Taoiseach respond to SIPTU, which has again pointed out that the trend within the private sector is for senior management grades to secure increases considerably above any relationship to others in middle management and all other worker levels within the private sector?  Does he not accept that the broad majority of people and a growing number of people believe it is grossly inequitable and gross hypocrisy for Ministers and senior civil servants in the public sector to have their returns linked to this trend within the private sector, something that represents the greediest aspirations from within the private sector?  Does the Taoiseach not recognise that there is great upset and hurt that, at the same time as seeing these recommendations regarding his own position and that of his colleagues, there are calls for pay restraint for ordinary workers?  For many it is a case of limited increases not even holding with inflation rates but falling back.  That is the reality for many people in employment today.  I ask whether the Taoiseach is aware of this real concern.  Does he not recognise that by his approach to benchmarking and the return for their worth and their labour to those in the public sector he is perpetuating an inequality and giving complementary endorsement to what is happening in the private sector?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_164">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_324">I am not here to argue about the two systems.  The review body dealing with pay for higher public servants and politicians, members of the Judiciary, those in local authorities and semi-state companies was established in 1969.  No Government since then nor any of the affiliated groups has seen the need to change that.  At the time people such as politicians, members of the Judiciary and senior people were considered to be managers somebody other than themselves, an outside body, was needed to examine the pay of the 1,600 people involved.  The benchmarking process emanated from what was total dissatisfaction by the representatives of organised labour and of Government with the system of relativities.  It was regarded as a poor system that created significant anomalies and industrial unrest.  A better system was called for and the benchmarking system was invented as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_325">I remind Deputy Gilmore that his argument is precisely the argument made by Deputy Kenny against the system at the time.  According to many, including Deputy Kenny who was not speaking for himself either, the first benchmarking report which was based on a comparable examination between the public and the private sectors awarded astronomical increases in the public sector, with an average increase of 9%.  The increase, which ranged from 9% to 27%, was applied across all grades.  It was seen as a gravy train for the public service.  This time the increases have not been so large because the tightness in the labour market which was allowed for in the comparable study in 1999 was very different from that existing in 2007.  The increases are smaller this time.  That is a how the cookie crumbles.  Those who set the rules must play the game by them.</p>

As TDs we decided to link ourselves to the principal officer grade and that does not show a 1.9% increase this time for most of the Members of the Oireachtas.  That is the system that is in operation and it is considered to be a far fairer and better system.</p>
            <p eId="para_330">Deputy Gilmore is correct on one point in that the top quartile in the private sector earns very large and incredible increases in pay.  The Department of Finance reply to a question from Deputy Mansergh shows that several thousands of people are on enormous incomes.  However, the benchmarking review body only deals with the bottom quartile, the bottom 15%, and it then discounts the pension.  I do not think the body is being over-generous to the vast majority of public servants in the way it makes its calculations.</p>

Does this statement by the Minister indicate a change of policy by the Government and has it now realised that the co-location policy is a backward step that will lead to more unequal delivery of health services and cost taxpayers many millions of euro in tax forgone?</p>

A number of recent significant seizures by the Garda in my area in the past week are to be welcomed.  This highlights the need for resources for drugs units to be doubled at least and for an increase in resources allocated to drugs education and awareness initiatives, treatment services and rehabilitation programmes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_353">No, that item is not agreed to by us.  We are unhappy with the proposal and we are opposed to taking it in the format of statements.  There was no consultation whatsoever with the Whips.  No meeting took place and no agreement was reached on this format.  The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil in April 2007 that a debate on these matters would be taken after consultation with the Opposition parties and only then would the debate take place.  No consultation has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Most, if not all Members, will have received a letter from Justice for the Forgotten referring to the important upcoming Dáil debate on collusion.  It was outlined in the letter that the debate which had been promised for over a year was finally due to take place and that the motion, which had yet to be decided, would be moved by the Taoiseach in the Dáil at 5 p.m. today.  The Oireachtas joint committee proposed in its final report that it would get direction from the Dáil and Seanad in regard to its recommendations.  Rather than statements, Justice for the Forgotten was promised that a motion would be moved, a debate would take place and a direction would be given.  None of that has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In effect, we are to have a discussion in a vacuum.  It appears that there is time to fill, given that no legislation is forthcoming from the Government, and there is no intention that this debate will proceed in any useful or positive fashion.  For that reason, we are unhappy with the proposal.  I have compiled a motion which would give direction to the recommendations from all of the committee reports.  Reference is made in the proposal to only the Barron committee.  Up to this morning we had the entire gamut of reports, including the original Irish Victims Commission report carried out by the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, and the MacEntee report.  Now it is confined to only the Barron reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We have had ten years of investigations, reports and recommendations and when the time comes for a debate in the Dáil, we only get statements.  This is not good enough.  It is certainly not good enough for the victims of the various serious atrocities that took place in this jurisdiction and it will not bring closure to the victims.  This is no way to treat the recommendations that have come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that a full debate would take place in this and the other House and that we would point the way forward with recommendations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_358">The promised debate is not now to take place.  The Taoiseach referred earlier in response to questions during Taoiseach's Question Time to the upcoming debate on collusion.  We do not have a debate and the word "collusion" is not even in the text of the terms or theme of address as presented on the Order Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">As Deputy Costello indicated, we were expecting a motion and without a motion there clearly can be no proposal for action.  No actions will arise out of statements presented here and again tomorrow.  The great fear of campaigning groups, not just Justice for the Forgotten, although very particularly that group, and all of the other groups as well, was that this issue would not be dealt with.   We expected this issue to be substantively addressed and that there would be an outline of proposed steps of action to be taken to which we could all subscribe.  This was against the backdrop of a decision already taken unanimously in this Chamber in regard to the murder of Pat Finucane.  It is not beyond the ability of all in this House to unite and come to agreement on the steps to be taken to move forward with some speed to see in place the fully transparent, accountable and public inquiry that is necessary into both the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and each of the other atrocities that were visited on innocent civilians here in this State at the hand of loyalist paramilitaries operated and controlled by British state forces.  That is what collusion is all about.  That is what was promised and that is not what we are seeing here.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">My fear, and that of many who I have cited, is that this will become just another milestone along a list of milestones down through the years of campaigning, and that it will bear no fruit.  That would be a great calamity.  It would in the end of the day be a further insult to the great people who are campaigning on these issues for many years and for whom there is an urgency in their lifetime to move forward to truth and justice on behalf of their loved ones, and indeed some of whom themselves are victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I concur with Deputy Costello.  These are points that I intended making again strongly in the course of the opportunity to present.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, in consultation with the Chief Whip, to revisit this with an immediacy.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">On the legislative list, I note the Bill in respect of the EU reform treaty is listed for publication.  Did the Government discuss the question of a date for the referendum on the treaty at Cabinet today and did it decide on a date?  If so, what is the date?</p>
          <p eId="para_484">In respect of a letter I sent to the Taoiseach on this matter and a related one, did the Cabinet discuss the question of children's rights?  Did it discuss extracting from the broader issue of children's rights the issue of protection for children from sexual predators?  Did the Cabinet agree to decouple that issue from the broader issue and to have a referendum on it on the same date as the referendum on the EU reform treaty?  If so, what is the date?  Will Members be given the heads of that Bill at an early date for discussion?</p>
          <p eId="para_485">With regard to the debacle over water charges for schools, has the Cabinet finalised its position on the issue?  The EU directive introduced in 2000 made it clear that water is deemed a precious commodity and we should have incentives in terms of conservation.  The Government has decided to charge from the first litre, whereas the directive clearly allows for a contribution to be made to the schools, above which use a charge should apply.  What is the Government's position on the issue now?</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Taoiseach is aware of the vicious and premeditated murder of Paul Quinn late last year and that this was a predetermined, preordained and premeditated murder, allegedly carried out by members of the Provisional IRA.  I asked before Christmas for an opportunity to discuss this in the House so Members could express their views on what I regard as a litmus test for the peace process and for an opportunity for Members to state their view that the late Paul Quinn was not deemed to be a criminal.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that there will be a debate on this next week and, if so, on what day will the debate be held?</p>

          <p eId="para_491">Deputy Kenny also raised the water charge issue.  The Government made its decision and issued a statement on that some weeks ago.  The Deputy could put down a question on the matter for the Ministers involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Government has discussed the issues surrounding the EU referendum.  It also discussed the suggestion made by Deputy Kenny.  We have asked the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, to discuss it with Deputy Kenny, Deputy Shatter and the Labour Party.  If it is possible and practicable to decouple it in a way that would secure consensus, we will examine it.  In the first instance, however, it is best to have a discussion with the Ministers.  I would like that to take place as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">Has the Cabinet fixed a date for the reform treaty referendum to be held?  Will it be before or after the summer?  If a date is fixed we can plan a proper programme of information for the electorate so voters can be properly informed when they go to vote.  As Deputy Shatter pointed out, we must agree on a method of decoupling the sexual predators and children's protection issue from the wider issue of children's rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">The Government has a firm view.  It is better to deal with that issue first, as the Deputy's letter suggested.  If that is not possible, it means the EU referendum will be held alone.  We were considering whether we could include the comprehensive children's issue as part of the EU referendum but it is not possible.  I understand there is too much work and it is just not possible to have it ready, whether we hold the referendum in June or September.  That is out of the equation.  We need to resolve whether it is possible to include the decoupled issue and to get all-party agreement on it.  I hope we can do that fairly quickly.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_495">I thank the Taoiseach for offering to consult both Fine Gael and the Labour Party on the referendum on children and the possible decoupling of the two elements of that referendum.  We will be glad to participate in those discussions.  Deputy Howlin is already on record on the matter.  Do I understand the Taoiseach correctly that the plan is to either have the European referendum on its own or to hold that referendum along with the issue relating to the sexual exposure of children, the age of consent and that dimension of the children's issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_496">What consideration has been given to an approximate date for the referendum?  It is important that we have a time scale for the referendum.  There was a suggestion by one Minister — I do not know whether it was intentional — that there was a possibility the European referendum would not be held until the autumn.  When is it intended to establish the referendum commission?  Is it intended that the referendum commission will publish information on the treaty?  There appears to be a lack of information on the treaty among the public and there is a hunger for that information.  When is it intended to publish the White Paper on the treaty?</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I also have questions on the long-term residential care services legislation, dealing with nursing home payments.  The Government did not publish that Bill prior to Christmas to allow for consultation with the organisations representing the elderly.  I am told those consultations have not taken place.  When will they take place?  When is the Bill likely to be published?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_215">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_498">On the last question, legal issues arose which have now by and large been resolved.  The Attorney General was directly involved in those issues and the questions raised have been resolved.  If the consultations have not taken place, they are due to take place soon.  The Bill is listed for this session and the Minister for Health and Children is anxious that it be dealt with in this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">On the first question, the Government's intention is to get agreement on the stages.  There will be a memorandum for Government on the referendum Bill.  The commission will be established after that.  The Government's view is that we move on it this side of the summer, if that is agreed.  We must ensure agreement on it.  We have clarified that the comprehensive children's issue cannot be taken, and there appears to be all-party agreement on that.  Deputy Howlin and Deputy Shatter have made it clear and the Minister, Deputy Smith, has reported that to me.  What remains is Deputy Kenny's suggestion that we decouple the segment from it.  We have to find out if that is possible and whether we can get all-party agreement on it.  It is not a simple issue either; there are arguments about it.  If we can do that, we can proceed but we must get the work programme moving quickly because there will only be a little over four months.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">If that cannot be done, we can proceed with the referendum anyway.  We are preparing the referendum Bill and obviously will have consultations on it.  The White Paper is in train and the Minister, Deputy Roche, has been active in talking to various groups and presenting the case on behalf of the Government.  He has talked to Members of the Opposition as well.  If we could resolve the decoupling issue, we could finalise the date.  However, I do not wish to do that until we have agreement following the consultations I promised.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">During the last session the Government issued a list of Bills that were to be published in that session.  When we asked questions about the Bills we were assured by the Taoiseach that they would be published before the end of the session.  The session effectively ended yesterday.  However, the Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill, the broadcasting Bill and the student support Bill have not been published.  The employment agency regulation Bill has not been published and has been demoted to category C.  The employment law compliance Bill, the appropriations Bill and the ombudsman (amendment) Bill have not been published.  The latter has been promised since 2003.  The adoption Bill and the nursing homes support scheme Bill have not been published while the criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill has been dropped to category B and has not been published.  The criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill has been dropped to category C and has not been published.  The prevention of corruption (amendment) Bill and the Dublin transportation Bill have not been published.  The latter was promised in 2003.  Of the 17 Bills promised, four were published, three of the remainder have been demoted from the primary list for publication and the rest will have a repeat performance for this session.

Officials working on the Bill are engaging in consultation with the Department of Finance about various issues, including the National Coaching and Training Centre.  The enforcement provisions in the broadcasting Bill are the subject of a legal review in the office of the Attorney General.  It is expected that the review will conclude, and the Bill will be published, in this session.  The student support Bill was cleared by the Cabinet today.  The employment regulation Bill will not be taken in this session.  The employment law compliance Bill will be ready.  The ombudsman (amendment) Bill will be ready.  The adoption Bill should be ready in February.  I have just dealt with the nursing homes (support) Bill.  The criminal justice Bill will not be ready in time for the spring session.

Given that it was acknowledged a moment ago that two weeks are conventionally afforded to Deputies to review new Bills, why is the Government considering the introduction of this legislation next week?  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that the conventional two-week period, at least, is made available to Deputies to consider the implications of the Bill.  Such a timeframe is necessary if Members are to have an opportunity to take submissions, for example.  Many people will wish to make submissions on the considerable changes being proposed in this legislation.  It is not an administrative Bill — it is a Bill that fundamentally changes jurisprudence in a number of areas and many aspects of human rights law.  It creates new procedures for detention and new sanctions in the legal profession.  Each of these measures requires the widest consultation with the bodies involved, without undue delay.  It seems extraordinary that the convention of allowing two weeks for consideration is not being adhered to in the case of a 141-page Bill.</p>

The family in question is now burdened with a massive legal debt which could put their home at risk.  The education (Ireland) Bill, which could help to meet the needs of the boy in question, is well down the Government's legislative list.  Can the Taoiseach tell us when that Bill will be brought to the House?  Will the Taoiseach take an interest in this case?  Does he appreciate the injustice being done to autistic children in County Wicklow, who cannot access ABA schooling provided by the State?  If those children were living in County Dublin, they would be able to access such educational provision.  The boy in question, Seán Ó Cuanacháin, has been assessed as needing this form of schooling — it would make all the difference to him and to others.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine this case.  A change of policy in this regard would not cost a huge amount of money, but it would make a huge difference to the individual families concerned.</p>

We have not been given an indication of when the Bill is likely to be published.  Reference has already been made to the forensics Bill, which will create the national DNA database.

          <p eId="para_536">I wish to correct a point the Taoiseach made earlier about the proposal from some voices to decouple the addressing of the spill-over from the C case from the addressing of the substantive issue of children's rights in terms of the Constitution.  Sinn Féin has not given its agreement to this proposition.  In fact, at the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children last week I indicated that our preference would be for both of these referendums to be held on the same day if possible.  If not, I am still of the view that we should comprehensively address children's rights.  This has only been reconfirmed this week by the publication of the CSO's headline statistics on crime.  Under the section dealing with child abandonment, neglect and cruelty, it can be seen that this increased by 86.8% in 2007 to a total of 566 recorded cases.  I do not want to overstate this, but as that crime statistic demonstrates, there are many children out there desperately and urgently in need of constitutional protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">My great fear, understanding as I do the urgency of addressing the implications of the C case, is that this will be addressed and everything else will be put on the long finger.  This is a reasonable fear because the Taoiseach has indicated previously in the House that he also had concerns on when this might be visited if it were not to be accommodated together with the C case issues in the current year, 2008.  That is on the record and I reiterated it at the committee last week.  Not all of the people there had the same recall as I had, but the Taoiseach will agree that this is an accurate reflection of what he said to me during previous exchanges here on the floor of the House.  I ask the Taoiseach to think long and hard about the decision to decouple and to move forward on the single issue of age of consent and all of the difficulties associated with this.  I understand the urgency, but there are many other areas in which children are being abused daily, not only sexually.</p>

This is all about people's rights to access health and social services.  I am speaking of the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill and the health information Bill.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would take my concerns on board.  They are not unique to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">No date is fixed for the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill or the health information Bill.  There is a detailed discussion paper on a whole range of sensitive issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">My preference all of last year, based on the commitment we gave in 2006, was to hold a referendum on the substantive issue of children's rights.  This suggestion emanated first from the constitutional review group set up by the then Taoiseach, former Deputy John Bruton, in 1996.  This was considered by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on at least two occasions, and it was concluded that we should revise the Constitution.  A Bill was introduced by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 19 February last year and we sought all-party agreement to bring the Bill forward.  It was felt that it was wrong to rush the Bill prior to the general election.  I was asked here not to do that and I agreed, but said that we would give a commitment to deal with the matter within 12 months or so.  The general election then took place and the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children started up in the autumn.  The committee is now in agreement that it will not be possible to go through the substantive issues and tease them all out during 2008.  It might complete its work but it will not be in a position to deal with legislation that covers all of this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Deputy Kenny has put forward an alternative proposal that we consider the limited issue of the age of consent and the Government is prepared to consider this and see whether we can get agreement.  Whether this is possible or not, we must consider it because it is not a simple issue of the age of consent — there are other matters that must be dealt with.  We cannot fix a date until we do this because we cannot plan a referendum without agreement on the subject of the referendum.  We must make a decision on that issue and then we can decide on a date for the referendum.  We want to do this by agreement because we must deal with the referendum Bill itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">There is a danger that if the issue of the age of consent is decoupled from general issue of children's rights, the referendum on the general issue may be put on the back burner.  I have seen this happen previously.  I will not say it is not a possibility.  However, this is a danger irrespective of whether the issues are decoupled.  We will need to discuss it and come to a decision on whether it is possible to do this.</p>

If it is possible to deal with the more limited issue of the age of consent, which is not being pressed for by NGO groups — one of them has made a statement on the issue but I am not sure how strongly it feels — we must consider this and come to a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The substantive issue, which was recognised in the Whitaker review of 12 years ago, remains to be dealt with.  The Bill is before the House but we need to obtain agreement through the committee.</p>

While I appreciate the Taoiseach has said the pharmacy (No. 2) Bill is a long way off, in light of the crisis regarding the pharmacies and the HSE could he consider a debate in the House on that issue? The health (long-term residential care) Bill has been discussed in the House since last February and the Taoiseach has still not given a date for its publication.  People are being held to ransom in nursing homes and I urge the Taoiseach to resolve the matter.  I received a letter today from a prominent consultant in the north-east area who has advised that the health service in that area is unsafe.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda cannot cope.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">It will be like the wedding feast at Cana.  On forthcoming Bills outlined in the legislative programme, which was given to Members, item 24 under the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is the designated land (housing development) Bill.  This is to provide for a "use it or lose it" scheme which could be deployed by local authorities on a selective basis to accelerate the development of appropriate land zoned for housing and to address the issue of land options.  In the autumn schedule this was indicated to be brought forward in early 2008, however no date has been given for it.  Given that the purpose of this Bill is a "use it or lose it" scheme and we have not used it, have we lost it and has the Bill been ditched?  If not, when will the Bill come before the House?</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Item 25 is the social housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is to provide a programme of social housing reforms aimed at improving services and their delivery including strengthening local authority powers to deal with anti-social behaviour, expanded paths to home ownership for social housing tenants and to provide for the rental accommodation scheme.  This Bill has been indicated to come before the House since 2004 and 2005.  It was indicated to come before the House in early 2008 and is now scheduled for mid-2008.  There is a long-standing issue relating to the ability of local authority tenants who live in flats to buy their own homes.  This right to buy is denied to them.  It requires a legislative framework for that to happen and in the ten years that those people have been denied that right, the prices of their properties have grown and interest rates have climbed.  Could the legislative framework for this area be brought forward in light of the fact that the Bill has been further delayed?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_595">The debate we are about to hold in this House is on a matter of the greatest national importance.  It is about a series of atrocities perpetrated on innocent people in our country, including the bombings of May 1974 in Dublin and Monaghan, which saw the greatest loss of life on a single day during the Troubles.  It is about murder, pure and simple and responsibility for that murder.  It is about justice for victims and about how victims and survivors were and are treated.  Certainly, it is about the past, but it is also about the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">To move forward to a better future, we need to understand what happened on this island over nearly 40 years of senseless violence.  Today's debate is part of that process.  It is, first and foremost, about honouring and remembering those who died in the violence of the Troubles, particularly the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and of the attacks in Dundalk and in the Border region in the 1970s which were the subject of Mr. Justice Barron's reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">As well as remembering the many lives lost, we must reflect on many more victims and survivors who are permanently scarred, both physically and mentally.  Many of those people are here today in the Public Gallery.  This debate in our national Parliament is about those people.  It is about their loved ones and about those issues that matter to them.  Over the years, I have met many of the victims and survivors of these atrocities and I know that many others in the House have too.  I have listened carefully to their stories and tried to understand their pain as best I can.  I have tried, through the office of Taoiseach, and through my colleagues in Government, to do all I can to address all of the issues they have raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">No two testimonies are the same, but I have always been touched by the depth of feeling and the continuing sense of pain and loss shared by those injured and grieving.  Their experiences demand to be heard, recognised and remembered in our wider society.  We have an obligation to those who suffered most in the conflict and we have an obligation to our society as a whole.  This was recognised a decade ago in the Good Friday Agreement, which affirmed that "it is essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation" and recognised "that victims have a right to remember as well as to contribute to a shared society".</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We have to build on the foundations which have been laid to ensure a stable, fair, inclusive and peaceful island where our children can look forward to happy and productive lives.  We have always acknowledged that this must not and, indeed, cannot be achieved by sidelining victims or by drawing a curtain of silence and secrecy over the events of the past.  Most important, it is the victims themselves, their representatives and the centrality of their experiences which are crucial to hopes for a better future, by ensuring we do not forget the mistakes and evils of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I would like to acknowledge the work already undertaken in this jurisdiction, including by the Victims Commissioner, the late Mr. John Wilson, by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and by the Remembrance Commission and Fund.  The commission's term has recently been extended, reflecting the fact that the needs of victims and survivors must continue to be properly met.  We had a generation or more of violence and, as with the broader process of reconciliation and transformation that is under way, these are issues that will have to be properly and actively addressed for many years to come.  In so far as we have responsibility in this jurisdiction, the Government will ensure that this will be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">We will also continue to work on these issues with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the appointment by the Northern Ireland Executive of the new team of victims commissioners earlier this week.  I recently met Mrs. McDougall, the former interim victims commissioner and I am sure that she and her new colleagues will take up their new task with the energy and sensitivity it requires and deserves.  I also welcomed the establishment by the British Government last summer of the consultative group on dealing with the past, headed by Mr. Denis Bradley and Archbishop Robin Eames.  I was pleased to meet that group in Dublin in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">It is appropriate to reflect, in this new context, on what is possible in terms of addressing the legacy of the past and I believe the consultative group can have an important role.  At the same time, I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task in a situation where the very definition of the conflict and of the term victim is so contested.  I am sure the group will learn much from the work undertaken by Mr. Justice Barron, by the Oireachtas sub-committee and by victims groups in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">One of the most important issues for victims and survivors is the simple need to know the truth about what happened.  For many, the knowledge that a neighbour was involved in the killing of a loved one is an additional burden to bear.  For others, the knowledge that members of the security forces were involved adds to their pain.  The suspicion that they were somehow involved in the commission of a crime or in ensuring that nobody was brought to justice is often the greatest injustice.  It is almost impossible to imagine how that must feel or how to help deal with such appalling situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">As the House is aware, we have established a number of inquiries into matters that are within this jurisdiction.  When we began this process with the appointment of the late Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, at the beginning of 2000, nobody thought we would be discussing the culmination of this work in 2008.  It has taken us eight solid years of detailed work and examination of all of the files that were available in this jurisdiction.  Many Departments were involved and the Ceann Comhairle was very helpful at the early stage, assisting us in the gathering and bringing together of the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">This has been a long and difficult journey.  Questions remain unanswered, but much has been achieved.  We now have much more information about who was responsible for these attacks than we had at the outset.  We know more about the circumstances in which the attacks were carried out and about the investigations of these crimes and where those investigations failed.  We must recall that when we revisited this issue, the investigation of these cases, in particular the 1974 bombings, closed up a matter of months after the events, with no further work done until 26 years later.  That was probably the most difficult issue, the fact that more than 25 years had elapsed and the files for the biggest atrocities that had happened in the Troubles were closed in August 1974.  The Ceann Comhairle will recall that was the position in which we found ourselves when we started on the road of re-examination.  The lapse of time was a considerable disadvantage but it did not stop the enormous amount of work that was undertaken in the past eight years.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">In some cases, theories that had been advanced over the years have been tested in a thorough and systematic way to the best extent possible, given the information available. Thanks to the work of the joint committee, the testimonies and experiences of victims and their families have been heard publicly in an appropriate way.  Many of the individuals and groups have interacted with Mr. Justice Hamilton and Mr. Justice Barron and made submissions over the period.  Where it was appropriate in the light of those investigations, formal apologies have been made by the Garda Síochána and Ministers.  In meetings with victims and survivors, I have offered my apologies on behalf of the Government for mistakes made in the past.  I wish to place that once more formally on the record of the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">For many families, their pain was heightened by the suspicion or knowledge that perhaps agents of the State, whose duty it is to protect its citizens and promote the rule of law, had played some part in the loss they had suffered.  In too many cases, official denials and contested facts made things worse and had a negative impact on confidence in policing and the administration of justice.  Of course, the question of collusion between the security forces and terrorists in perpetrating these attacks has always been a central unanswered question.  Sadly, in many cases that remains the case to this day.  We have consistently called on the British Government to meet its responsibilities to co-operate with inquiries in this State and to help the process of uncovering the truth about what happened.  I repeat the call in the House today that I have made many times here and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The willingness of the British authorities to co-operate with the various inquiries has been tested and in many cases found wanting.  We tried to address these issues by establishing inquiries in certain important and representative cases in discussions with the British Government at Weston Park in July 2001.  For our part, we have abided by the commitment to establish the inquiry into the murders of Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan, which is now proceeding under Judge Smithwick.  While inquiries are under way in the cases of Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson and Billy Wright, the inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane has not been established by the British Government.  The House and the Government have made clear our view that a proper independent inquiry must be established as recommended by Judge Cory.  I again repeat that call today.  While I regret that all of our efforts to date have not been fully successful for the victims, that does not mean we will give up trying to get those commitments honoured.  I know we have the support of the entire House in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">In more recent years, the valuable work of the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland has uncovered further clear evidence of collusion.  For example, the detailed report into the killing of Raymond McCord was truly shocking, even for those who had long suspected the level of collusion.  It also proved that the issue of collusion matters to all of us and to all communities in Northern Ireland.  It is not a purely Nationalist concern, as has been eloquently demonstrated by Raymond's father's campaign for justice for his son.  He has met my officials and me a number of times.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">As we speak of dealing with the past, I am acutely conscious that no strategy or formula, however inventive, can diminish that sense of loss or undo the harm that has been done.  We need to constantly remember the sheer scale of the horror and loss that was visited on so many families during the Troubles.  More than 3,700 people lost their lives during the Troubles, while more than 40,000 suffered injury.  We must constantly remind ourselves of the appalling price that many people have paid over these long years — the loss of life, the injury, trauma, psychological damage and lost opportunities suffered and endured by people from all walks of life, of all ages and from all traditions.  Nobody has a monopoly on suffering or victimhood, as I have said many times.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">When we speak of collusion, it is also essential to remember that many members of the security forces and their families underwent terrible pain and suffering arising from the conflict.  When we contemplate the vicious attacks on the Catholic community along the Border, we must also remember the equally vicious attacks on members of the Protestant community in that same area.  The families of those who died know better than anyone that pain and despair do not distinguish on the basis of political belief, religion or any other human attribute.  The pain is felt by the relatives of the dead in Belfast, Derry, Enniskillen, Omagh, rural County Armagh and so many other places that have become so tragically associated with death and suffering.  Many of the people who died in Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk were from counties all over the South.  It pierces the hearts of victims and survivors in those places as much as it does those victims who are with us today and whom I have gotten to know over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The enormous political progress of recent years cannot wipe away our memory of the dreadful consequences of all violence — the loss of trust, the damage done to community relations, the undermining of confidence in the administration of justice and, perhaps the greatest price, the entrenchment and deepening of divisions between the two communities in Northern Ireland and between the two traditions on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">We need to understand that collusion occurred.  We need to understand how that was allowed to happen so that we can ensure it never happens again.  We need to understand why it matters, not just to victims but to all of society, so that we build a sustainable, peaceful future.  It is essential that the impressive gains made in policing reform and accountability and the growing cross-community confidence in the transformed policing environment in Northern Ireland are consolidated for the future.  The work of the new Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Historical Enquiries Team, the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland are all essential to a better future.  The completion of British demilitarisation is another tremendous sign of hope.  The completion of the devolution project through the transfer of policing and justice powers from Westminster as agreed at St. Andrews will be a further essential step.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">We have reached a profoundly positive new stage in the peace process in Northern Ireland.  Relationships between Unionism and Nationalism, between North and South on this island and between these islands have never been better.  What drives us all now is the realisation that never again should our people experience and bear witness to a terrible conflict.  The work of reconciliation must continue.  The victims and survivors must be as much a part of the future as they are of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I promised this debate in the autumn.  I promised that, starting on the first day back of this session, we would have an opportunity today and tomorrow for people to air their views.  This does not end our work or any of the processes in which we have been involved, but it honours the commitment to bring the issue before the House.  It was not possible to do so in the autumn of 2007, but we have the opportunity today.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The ongoing work in handling these issues continues.  The Government Whip and the Government will continue to deal with these matters, as the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs have worked to do.  As part of what we are doing, I welcome this debate and the views which will be expressed by Members today and tomorrow.  My officials, people in other relevant Departments and I will continue to deal with the issues as we have been doing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_617">Like the Taoiseach, I raised this serious matter a number of times and I welcome the debate on it at the start of the Dáil session.  The sad thing is that the families of persons who lost their lives in those tragic circumstances have no closure to the events.  Despite some progress being made and, in some cases, the convictions of persons, there are others who believe that the system has not dealt with their loved ones being blown up, murdered or so on during a troubled time in the country's recent history.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">As we speak, there are people who know the answers to the questions of who was involved and who gave the orders.  There are those who know that collusion took place and those who know who was involved in that collusion.  The sad thing is that we as a Legislature cannot put a finger on those people and have the arm of the law bring them to justice to deal with their outrageous acts of murder and mayhem.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The debate underlines the strength of feeling in the House about the need to resolve the violent atrocities that were inquired into by Mr. Justice Barron and the great work he did.  While we can hope with some confidence that the conflict in which these acts were perpetrated will not exist in the future, we cannot say that what happened in the past can be ignored or left unresolved.  That is where the pain still remains for the families.  It would be a travesty of justice and inflict more pain and grief on those families whose lives were shattered beyond belief.  We owe it to the victims and their families to do everything we can as a Legislature and Parliament on behalf of the people to see that these crimes are resolved and that closure and some finality is brought to this very sad period in our recent history.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The value of the reports produced by Mr. Justice Barron is that they confirm what we have long suspected, namely, that there is very clear evidence of collusion by the security forces in many of these murders.  I accept this conclusion and am sure that all parties in the House do likewise.  Knowing that collusion occurred and bringing those responsible to justice are two very different matters.  For many years, I have highlighted the persistent refusal of the British Government to co-operate properly with the Barron inquiry.  This lack of co-operation is confirmed in these reports by Mr. Justice Barron.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I also understand that former members of the security forces were given not just an instruction but a written instruction not to respond to the inquiry.  I find it quite incredible that the British Government would so blatantly and brazenly ignore a formal commission of inquiry established by this State.  Not even the Taoiseach's special relationship with the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was able to break that down.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">It is important for us to consider what the sub-committee said.  We have had representations from a number of the groups involved.  The sub-committee did a very good job of dealing with these matters.  I will put some of this on the record in this debate.  The sub-committee stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_623">The Sub-Committee is left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that are considered in this report.  We are horrified that persons who were employed by the British administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and the butchering of innocent victims.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_624">The Sub-Committee believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there cannot be closure for the families.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Point taken.  It goes on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_626">The Sub-Committee further believes that unless the full truth about collusion is established and those involved either admit or are fixed with responsibility then there is always the risk of what occurred in the 1970s occurring again some day.  We are of the view that these matters cannot be swept under the carpet.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_627">The Sub-Committee is of the view that given that we are dealing with acts of international terrorism that were colluded in by the British security forces, the British Government cannot legitimately refuse to co-operate with investigations and attempts to get to the truth.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_628">The Sub-Committee notes that the British cabinet was aware of the level to which the security forces had been infiltrated by terrorists and we believe that its inadequate response to this knowledge permitted the problem to continue and to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">It also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_630">Our experience has been that the British authorities have reacted to the issues that arise from the atrocities in a closed and defensive manner.  The natural instinct appears to be to selfishly defend the organisation or administration to which one belongs.  The Sub-Committee believes there is a need for officials to change the manner in which they think and act and for them to be more open about the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">When the Taoiseach sat down with the former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in whatever discussions they had in private, I am quite sure he put it very clearly to Mr. Blair, on behalf of the Irish people and the Irish Government, that the papers and evidence, documentary and otherwise, available to the British Government should be made available in light of the peace process to bring closure to this.  I am sure he did his best.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_633">However, the Prime Minister was not for turning.  Maybe Deputy Mansergh was there as well.  I do not know.  I was not informed of his activities.  The fact is that there is still a lack of closure here, there has been a failure to bring the perpetrators of murders to justice and ongoing evidence of collusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I do not know whether the Taoiseach has had any contact with the current Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, whether Mr. Brown has had any contact with the Taoiseach or whether officials from both governments have been in touch with each other.  This is a matter which we must continue to attempt to sort out.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">In his final report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, Mr. Justice Barron said that the notion that members of the security forces in Northern Ireland could have been involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings was "neither fanciful nor absurd".  In his report into the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, Mr. Justice Barron says that it is quite possible that the bombs were planted to influence the debate on that Bill in this House.  He also said there were some elements of the attacks that were not characteristic of loyalist subversive groups at that time such as the giving of a warning, the use of hired vehicles, the co-ordinated nature of the blasts and the apparent use of a car stolen four months previously.  He went on to say that "these features may be consistent with involvement by the British Army or Intelligence Services in the bombings".</p>
          <p eId="para_636">In respect of the bombing of Kay's Tavern, the sub-committee said that in some of the incidents in question, collusion was almost beyond question.  Justice for the Forgotten, quite rightly, have been very concerned and vocal about these reports and the necessity to bring closure.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Taoiseach is aware that we have all supported the Good Friday agreement and the peace process and attempted in whatever way we can, in or outside Government, to make an impact for the greater good of our communities and people.  I remind the British Government that strand three of the agreement concerns the development of the east-west relationship between Great Britain and Ireland.  This provides an opportunity and a platform for co-operation to again resurrect the requirement that the documentary evidence and written evidence available to the British Government be made available so that some closure can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I said earlier in the House today that the atrocious and vicious premeditated murder of Paul Quinn is a litmus test for the peace process.  As was the case with the murder of Robert McCartney, on which there is still no closure three years on, we do not want the Paul Quinn case to drift into oblivion.  It is 30 years on and families whose perfectly innocent loved ones were blown up still do not have closure for this sense of grief, which the Taoiseach rightly articulated here.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I know some of those from the Dublin bombings.  As the Taoiseach is aware, they were from all over the country.  The next time the Taoiseach meets the Prime Minister,   Mr. Brown, he should suggest that, in the development of all our islands, the First Minister, Dr. Paisley, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, are now working together in the interests of the communities in Northern Ireland and it behoves both governments to see that the assembly can function and make decisions about the lives of the people in Northern Ireland, irrespective of the sector of society from which they come.  In the sense of a new era and country, the development of the economic progress of the island, North and South, to which the Irish Government is contributing in terms of roads, infrastructure, cross-Border cultural activity, education and health, here is a sore point that has not been sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">As stated at the beginning, there are people who have the answers to questions of the families.  There is evidence on files in the archives of Britain that would lead to much greater information being made available in the hope that perpetrators of those murders would be brought to justice.  We had a debate in the House last year and called for a full scale public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane.  The House adopted that motion unanimously, without disagreement.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, it has not yet happened.  In many ways, the longer this goes on, the sorer the point becomes.  There are those who know the answers to these questions and there is documentary evidence in archived files at some location, the release of which could be ordered by the British Prime Minister.  I hope officials in the Taoiseach's Department make contact.  Let us renew the call from this parliamentary democracy to see the investigation into a clear case of collusion between security forces and terrorists being sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I admire the groups and organisation that have displayed commitment and dedication to seeing this matter being resolved.  We can give them whatever assistance we can, through the forum of this Parliament and Legislature.  This party supports every effort the Government makes to have this information released and archival documents provided.  In stating my admiration for the undying commitment of the groups involved, I recognise that they are still pained, that they still grieve, and that the loved ones taken away so cruelly have not had justice done on their behalf.  Politics, politicians and Governments can bring closure to this matter.  In not having the evidence one needs to bring those involved before the judicial and legal processes, there is an issue that must be resolved.  The Taoiseach will have our full support in efforts to revive the matter.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach would instruct his officials to renew contact with officials on the British side and if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs could re-establish formal links and try to influence the current British Prime Minister to see that this information is released.  This is in the interests of dealing with this matter conclusively but principally for the families involved and those whose lives were cruelly ended by bombs and collusion between security forces and terrorists.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_642">It is unusual that the first week's business in the Dáil in 2008, apart from Private Members' business, is devoted exclusively to statements.  There is no more important issue than the one before us today, which must be comprehensively addressed by our Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">A Dáil debate on the recommendations of the reports on the joint committee into the four reports on Judge Barron's inquiry into the violent incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland would be valuable.  A Dáil debate on the fourth and final report finding of collusion between the security forces and paramilitaries in carrying out these violent incidents would be even more valuable.  However, statements, and only statements, are the worst possible way of addressing the life and death issues involved.  Statements are a pretence of dealing seriously with an issue when in reality this method ensures the discussion takes place in a vacuum and that there is no proposal or motion for action emanating from the two days' discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Like every Deputy in Dáil Eireann, I received an e-mail from Margaret Urwin of Justice for the Forgotten a week ago alerting me to the "important upcoming Dáil Debate on collusion.  The debate having been promised for over a year is finally happening and the motion which has yet to be decided will be moved by the Taoiseach in the Dáil at 5.00 p.m.  The significance of the debate is underlined by the fact that it will be observed by members of the Eames-Bradley Consultative Group on the past, in addition to many of the victims of collusion in this jurisdiction".  I wish to acknowledge the presence of the members of the Justice for the Forgotten and the Consultative Group on the Past from Northern Ireland.  As Justice for the Forgotten knows by now, its expectations are unfulfilled and no motion and no debate on collusion has been tabled.  There is no debate at all — instead we have statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">As a result, I prepared a comprehensive motion, summarising the recommendations of the various reports and offering a way forward.  The Taoiseach has left the Chamber but I intend to send this to him after the debate.  Perhaps the Minister of State will bring it to his attention and he will reflect on it overnight, before the debate continues tomorrow, and accept or amend it.  It would be a shame if we have a debate over two days without concrete proposals for action emerging at the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I was Labour Party spokesperson for justice and a member of the Oireachtas Joint justice sub-committee that conducted the public hearings and compiled three of the four reports on Judge Barron's investigations into the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, the murder of Seamus Ludlow in 1976 and the bombing of Kay's Tavern, Dundalk.  The testimony and witness of the surviving victims and relatives was the most poignant and compelling part of our deliberations.  Few members of the sub-committee were left unmoved by the experience.  The sense of loss and pain for their loved ones which they experienced 30 years and more after the tragic events was compounded by the insensitive way that many of them were treated by the agents and agencies of the State and by the failure of the State to vindicate their rights as citizens under the Constitution.  It seemed the State wished to wipe away the entire series of atrocities as though they had never happened.  Only the courageous campaign of Justice for the Forgotten and the turn of events in Northern Ireland eventually shamed the State into activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">On 10 April 1998, the historic Good Friday Agreement was reached.  It recognised the suffering of the victims of violence must be acknowledged and addressed as an essential element of reconciliation.  The agreement recognised services would have to be provided to support the needs of victims.  Support would also need to be channelled through both statutory and community-based organisations requiring the allocation of sufficient resources, including statutory funding to meet the needs of the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">A victims commission was established under the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, which reported in July 1999.  The Ceann Comhairle, then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was instrumental in establishing that initiative.  Mr. Wilson's recommendations were wide-ranging and humane and dealt in detail with the needs for support and long-term care of traumatised and damaged victims, as well as compensation for the families of those killed and the costs arising from the injuries sustained.  He recommended a victim's pension be established for certain categories of victims.  Few of his detailed recommendations, however, have been implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">He also recommended the appointment of a retired Supreme Court judge to conduct an independent inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and into the murder of Seamus Ludlow.  Mr. Justice Henry Barron was appointed by the Oireachtas and carried out four substantial investigations into the violent incidents which occurred in the Republic in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The sub-committees, established by motions of the Dáil and Seanad to consider each of Mr. Justice Barron's reports, had a positive and challenging remit.  They sought in particular to deliver comprehensive recommendations in their first and final reports.  Of the three tasks the sub-committee was charged with in relation to Mr. Justice Barron's first report into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, two were directed towards future actions.  The first concerned the lessons to be drawn and any actions to be taken in the light of the report, its findings and conclusions.  The second was whether, having regard to the report's findings and following consultations with the inquiry, a further public inquiry into any aspect of the report would be required or fruitful.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">In its first set of recommendations, the sub-committee considered a full public inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiries Act 1921 would have represented the preferred form of inquiry.  However, because the perpetrators, information and witnesses were outside the jurisdiction, legal and procedural difficulties would arise from an inquiry initiated in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The sub-committee recommended a series of steps to achieve a similar result by a different route.  A precedent existed for this approach which drew on the agreement of the British and Irish Governments to appoint Mr. Peter Cory, a Canadian judge, to conduct a thorough investigation of allegations of collusion by the security forces in six specific cases to which the two sovereign Governments committed themselves following discussion with the Northern Ireland parties at Weston Park in 2001.  These were the murders of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill, Rosemary Nelson, Billy Wright, Lord Justice and Lady Gibson, chief superintendent Harry Breen and superintendent Bob Buchanan.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The independent judge would have the same powers the two sovereign Governments conferred on Judge Cory.  The judge would have the power to direct witnesses for interview and the power to compel the delivery of documentation in both jurisdictions.  In the event that a public inquiry was recommended, the relevant Government would implement that recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The sub-committee built in a safeguard.  It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_655">In the event of the tried and tested Weston Park procedure failing as a consequence of a lack of co-operation from the Government or authorities in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, the sub-committee recommends the Irish Government should consider instituting proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights seeking appropriate declaratory relief against the United Kingdom requiring it to put in place an appropriate investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">To copperfasten the procedures, the sub-committee proposed its recommendations be endorsed by the Dáil and Seanad and by the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Unfortunately, no recommendations were implemented.  I have raised them on numerous occasions in the Dáil in the intervening years.  To be fair, the Taoiseach has taken up the issues from time to time with the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, but was rebuffed and no further action was taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The initial important step that could so easily have been taken, namely, the formal adoption of the four reports and their findings by the Dáil and Seanad, never took place nor were the reports ever forwarded to the British House of Commons.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">In its fourth and final report in 2007, the sub-committee made its most damning finding.  It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_660">The sub-committee is left in no doubt that collusion between the British security forces and terrorists was behind many if not all of the atrocities that are considered in this report.  We are horrified that persons who were employed by the British Administration to preserve peace and to protect people were engaged in the creation of violence and the butchering of innocent victims.  The sub-committee is of the view that given that we are dealing with acts of international terrorism that were colluded in by the British security forces, the British Government cannot legitimately refuse to co-operate with investigations and attempts to get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">These trenchant findings on collusion were made in the light of the accumulation of evidence over the four Barron reports and hearings conducted by the sub-committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The sub-committee concluded that "the seriousness of this, i.e., collusion, warrants direction from the Oireachtas and we, therefore, recommend that there should be a full debate in both the Dáil and Seanad on the issue of collusion since it is necessary for there to be greater political impetus to highlight the fact that it occurred and the facts of its scale and to identify measures to bring closure to the victims".  The sub-committee proposed the Oireachtas give direction on the way forward to achieve the necessary action concerning collusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">While the Taoiseach responded positively in subsequent remarks, I propose four courses of action.  First, the interim and final reports of the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on the report of the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings should be received, endorsed and approved by the Dáil and Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Second, the Ceann Comhairle should be called upon to formally inform the Speaker of the House of Commons of the UK of the passage of the resolution and to send copies of the relevant reports and other documents, with a request that the matter be considered by the members of that House.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Third, the Taoiseach should be called upon to renew his efforts to secure the agreement of the British Government to the courses of action recommended by the sub-committee, to report to the Dáil on a regular basis.  If he has no progress of substance to report by the end of this year, he should report on the steps taken for the initiation of proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Fourth, the Oireachtas should request the Ceann Comhairle to call upon the British Government, as an initial step and as a sign of good faith in dealing with the legacy of the conflict, to provide access to all the original documents relating to the atrocities that occurred in this jurisdiction, in particular the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974 which killed 32 Irish citizens, a French citizen and an Italian citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Only when these avenues are explored can the victims and families obtain justice and closure on these terrible events.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">We are debating this motion because of a sinister and orchestrated attack on the integrity of the Mahon tribunal mounted by the Fianna Fáil Party just before Christmas.  One by one, Fianna Fáil Ministers were queuing up to go on the airwaves to attack the way in which the Mahon tribunal was doing its work.  I will get to some of the specific comments later but terms such as "bias", "unfair" and "acting outside its remit" were thrown at the tribunal in a desperate bid to distract the public from the evidence which was being given and to discredit the work of the tribunal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_678">It appears that campaign, that series of interviews, was organised and orchestrated not by the Fianna Fáil press office but by the Government press secretary, whose job and whose official function is to act as a spokesperson for the Taoiseach and Government.  This is not what one would expect from Ministers in a democratically elected Parliament in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The purpose of the attacks by Fianna Fáil Ministers was perfectly clear.  It was a diversionary tactic to persuade people not to look at the evidence, at the crumbling credibility of the Taoiseach or at the complete absence of any credible paper trail for his stories of large cash lodgements to personal accounts.  Instead, they wanted people to look at the mud they were throwing.  What I would have liked to have heard from the Fianna Fáil Ministers is the answer to a simple question.  Do they believe the Taoiseach's accounts that he is giving under oath in the tribunal?  These courageous broadcasters will never answer that particular question.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Of course this campaign could not happen by accident.  The Taoiseach has sought to undermine the tribunal, including accusations that it was trying to "stitch him up".  He has complained on the public airwaves that he does not get the same fair hearing as other witnesses at the tribunal.  The situation got so farcical that Fianna Fáil Ministers now want to dictate to the tribunal what questions it should ask and what it should not ask.  That approach represents a blatant attempt to intimidate the work of the tribunal and should be rejected by all right-minded supporters of democracy in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Time and again, the tribunal has had to remind the Taoiseach why it was investigating his finances and why it had to examine him in public about these issues.  On 20 December the chairman, Judge Mahon, laid it out clearly and I quote his words:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">I'll try and explain it.  The evidence the tribunal has from Mr. Gilmartin is that he was told by Mr. O'Callaghan that sums of £30,000 and £50,000 had been paid to you [the Taoiseach].  Mr. O'Callaghan denies saying it and he denies paying it and you deny receiving it.  But that prompted necessarily the tribunal, as it has done in similar instances involving other witnesses, in this and other modules.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_683">It necessarily prompted the tribunal to look at your personal finances.  When the tribunal looked at your personal finances it sees the lodgements that we're talking about.  And that necessitates the inquiry and the level of inquiry that has been conducted since.  That is the basis for the probing of your finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Despite this very clear explanation, a series of Fianna Fáil Ministers queued up to go on the airwaves to attack the work and method of work of the tribunal.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_686">These included the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who said he was "astounded" by what the tribunal was doing.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan, complained about a lack of fairness.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said that Ministers had criticised the tribunal out of a sense of political loyalty, a case of putting party interests before the national interest.  However, not to be left out, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, capped them all.  In an outrageous attack he accused the tribunal counsel of being "petty, personal and provocative".  He accused it of asking questions which were "quite unacceptable", he referred to unfair procedures, "unacceptable in a civilised society", "appalling treatment" and said that the tribunal was "badgering" the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">Following these attacks, on the morning of 21 December 2007, Judge Mahon gave a summary of the tribunal's approach to the Taoiseach's cross-examination.  It is important to read his comments into the record of this House so that no Member can be under any illusion or any misunderstanding about what the tribunal is doing.  He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_688">A tribunal of inquiry is inquisitorial in nature and it approaches its work — especially the taking of evidence in public — on this basis.  It does not make allegations or promote any particular view or predetermine any matter.  Evidence given in public hearings, including documentary evidence, can be true or false, or be partly true or be partly false.  False or inaccurate evidence can be given accidentally or innocently, or more seriously can be given intentionally and designed to mislead the inquiry.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_689">It would be a useless and meaningless exercise for a tribunal to merely put every witness into the witness box and simply record his or her evidence without question or where appropriate without challenge. . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_690">It is the role and duty of counsel to the tribunal to probe and test the evidence of witnesses and of documentary evidence in a manner which will ensure that the tribunal will have at the end of the day the fullest possible picture of the evidence so that it will be in a position to determine the accuracy and effect of that evidence, especially in those circumstances where there is apparent conflict between the testimony of witnesses or with documentary evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Importantly he concluded:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_692">Cross-examination of a witness where there is a significant absence of supporting documentary evidence, which it has to be said is not an indication of anything improper, is lengthy, complex and at times tedious.  In so far as any of these descriptions might be deemed to apply to the cross-examination of the Taoiseach, the tribunal is satisfied that such detailed cross-examination is necessary and appropriate if the tribunal is to be placed in a position where it can ultimately, properly and fairly adjudicate on the issues arising.  In no way is Mr. Ahern being treated any differently to any other witnesses in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Those are the clarifying words of the chairman the morning after these attacks.  Judge Mahon does not have the facility of going on the public airwaves to defend the work of his tribunal.  So it is appropriate that his words be put on the record of the House for everybody to read.  I have taken time to put Judge Mahon's words on the record of this House so that anyone who speaks on this debate and who wants to repeat the accusations they made of bias, unfairness, astounding questions, prying, prurient questions, stitching people up, having an agenda or acting illegally will make those comments in the full knowledge of what Judge Mahon said.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Tonight the Government has put before this House a cobbled-together amendment to try to hold together the strings of a rag-bag of an exhausted Government for which the concept of collective Cabinet responsibility has gone out the window.  I will explain to the House why Fine Gael will not accept the Government amendment.  It drops references to bias and independence which were the claims made by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  It proposes the enactment of a Bill which would allow the Government to close down the Mahon tribunal and it virtually invites Ministers to criticise the tribunal's procedures and welcomes opportunities to discuss procedures.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">——to protect their little spaces on their fine leather seats.  When it suits the Green Party it puts on the veil of collective responsibility as a shield.  Nowhere is this more true than the European reform treaty where the Green Party Ministers are happy to be included in the yes camp on the basis that a collective Cabinet decision has been made to endorse the treaty.  However, when the same Ministers go out and publicly and repeatedly attack a tribunal of inquiry set up by this House, accusing it of "acting outside its remit", we get only silence from the Green Party.  Truth, standards and integrity no longer exist in this green tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Last September when this House debated a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, I set out the reasons he should step down.  I asked if the Taoiseach was correct to take large sums of money for personal use.  My view was that he was wrong.  I asked if the Taoiseach fully and freely co-operated with the Mahon tribunal.  My view was that he did not.  I asked if the Taoiseach told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, to the people, the Dáil and the tribunal.  My view is that he has not.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">In the debate the Taoiseach said "The House established the tribunal and Members should let it get on with its work."  Does the Taoiseach consider a Minister accusing the tribunal of "bias", "astounding questions", "acting outside its remit" and being "unfair" is allowing the tribunal to get on with its work?  Far from censoring such Ministers about their comments, I have no doubt that the Taoiseach actively encouraged those comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">For months we have seen the Taoiseach portray himself time and again as a victim.  Before he appeared at the Mahon tribunal, he assured us all that he could not wait to go before the judges and give a full and categorical explanation for his finances.  Now after six days of hearings, he is complaining that he has been victimised in some way and treated differently from other witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The Taoiseach seems to have forgotten that, as with Mr. Ray Burke, the late Mr. Liam Lawlor, Mr. George Redmond and Mr. Frank Dunlop, the tribunal is merely following the money trail, a tried, tested and successful method for tribunals of inquiry.  The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil in September 1997 "following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry".  Perhaps the reason for this extraordinary attack by Fianna Fáil on the tribunal is that the tribunal is progressing its inquiry in a way which is not to the liking of the Fianna Fáil Ministers surrounding this Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">One hundred and fifty people have been investigated or interviewed in the Quarryvale module of the tribunal and overall approximately 600 people have been interviewed.  In only one case has there been an outcry from Fianna Fáil Ministers about the tribunal acting outside its remit or acting illegally or unfairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">This afternoon in reply to a question from Deputy Gilmore, we heard the Taoiseach with his latest U-turn explaining his personal finances.  His new statement about the Revenue position on his tax affairs has directly contradicted his public statement of last week.  If it is indeed the position that Revenue can finalise his tax affairs at any time.  I would hope that he can now pay the amounts outstanding and obtain a valid tax clearance certificate.  It is not a healthy situation for the prime minister of this country to stand up in the United States and address the Congress and the Senate when he does not have a tax clearance certificate in his own country.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I remind the Taoiseach that on 27 September 2006 he told this House that he "had checked the matter with the tax authorities long ago".  He had not checked.  On 26 September 2007, one year later, I asked him if he would make a personal statement correcting the record of the House and he told me he had not misled the House in any way.  Even though we now know that the Taoiseach had not checked with the tax authorities, he still has not come before this House and corrected the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">In his contribution on the motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste made a great virtue of political loyalty. He said "political loyalty is a virtue and that loyalty will be maintained by the Government for the Taoiseach."  It is obvious that for him, political loyalty is paramount and more important than loyalty to the institutions of the State; the integrity of this House and the credibility of the Office of the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The truth is that the Fianna Fáil Ministers are more interested in protecting their own political careers and the fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party and in preventing the people from finding out the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">We have witnessed a new complacency, a new arrogance, a new smugness from a Government that has crawled back into office.  It shows a new disdain for the House when misleading statements are left uncorrected and no new legislation is brought forward.  There is a new smugness, a new self-satisfaction.  As the country faces a range of serious economic and social challenges, these are the issues which the House should be discussing.  I refer to the fact that a businessman pays €100,000 for an operation for a young child in County Cork when there is a National Treatment Purchase Fund that should be dealing with such a case.  I refer to the fact that a young man was savagely attacked and died at the hands of an unfortunate person who had sought psychiatric treatment on three separate occasions and was not admitted to hospital, resulting in the death of a young man.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">When people all over the country are losing confidence in the ability of the Government to deal with their daily concerns, we must resort to using the valuable time of this House because the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has not been in a position to provide a credible answer and a credible series of answers to questions about the movement of significant amounts of money — up to €300,000 in today's terms — through personal accounts which he held.  In the 1990s, for whatever reason, bags of money landed on the desk in Drumcondra.  That is not the way to do business and that has been underlined in the terms of setting up the tribunal and in comments made by people since then.  That is not the way to do business on behalf of the public and it is the root cause of all this energy, all this paperwork, all this cost, because the truth is not coming out.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Mahon tribunal is doing its duty independently, without bias and within its terms of reference as decided by this House.  If those Ministers on the other side of the House wish to speak on this motion, they will have the opportunity to deal with the lack of bias, independence and fairness within the remit.  We will give them that opportunity when they come in here to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">This motion is clear, simple and direct.  The Government amendment is cobbled together and does not deal with those three central issues of the independence of the tribunal, its acting without bias and its acting within its remit.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

They have to have tax clearance certificates while inside that building sits a Taoiseach who does not have one.  The reason he does not have one goes back to the 1990s.  That is the nub of this question and that is what this country is left with and what we are here to debate.  That is why we are present and why Members on the other side are absent.  The truth is the Mahon tribunal has been inquiring into planning and political corruption for the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">When we look around this House we see images of the men of 1916 who brought about the revolution that set up this State.  I read over Christmas the historic debates in this House on all sides, that included contributions from the likes of William Cosgrave, Eamon de Valera and Tom Johnson who came here, argued and fought and eventually worked together for a true, clean and proper democracy, who built up and handed to us, through our parents an honest and decent Government of all sides.  That is what they gave us but that is not what we have had from this Fianna Fáil Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">We have had Charles Haughey, a Taoiseach for many years, about whom a tribunal outlined line after line and page after page of donations, none of which was declared, all to maintain and sustain a lifestyle which was totally and absolutely unacceptable and anathema to those people who voted for him.  We now have a Government led by a Taoiseach who does not have a tax clearance certificate.  That is what this is all about.</p>

When the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Sargent, was leader of the Green Party the information about his life in politics included the information that when he was given £100 by a builder in north County Dublin he went into the chamber of Dublin County Council and when he raised the issue he was attacked from all sides.  Sadly, that note has now disappeared from Deputy Sargent's CV.  I do not know where it is gone but it certainly was not there tonight when I went looking for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">The Green Party has been bought very cheaply.  In the ten years following his election, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stood on this side of the House and berated Fianna Fáil for low standards in high places.  Unfortunately, he is not present tonight.  Now, emasculated by the aura of office, he insults our intelligence and those who voted for him by attempting to justify his support for a dishonest amendment drawn up by a sleazy Government led by a Taoiseach who is not tax compliant and who has tested the patience of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I take no satisfaction at all in saying this.  I always thought the Green Party was a force for good.  It evolved from a mixture of thinkers of different sorts in terms of alternative lifestyles into an efficient political party.  Many people on all sides of the political spectrum believed the party would make a worthy addition to Government and then we witnessed the events of the past eight months; Green Party capitulation after capitulation, defeat after defeat, U-turn after U-turn.  Green politics is now roll over and lie down politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I remind the Minister, Deputy Gormley, that the people who elected him in Dublin South-East are watching what is happening in this House.  They do not take kindly to having him on the airwaves week after week attempting to explain that what he is saying now is exactly the same as what he said then, even though it sounds like the complete opposite.  I remind the House also that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is only in the Dáil because Deputy Creighton asked her supporters to transfer votes to him.  I also remind him that his presence in Government is a reality because the Taoiseach reckoned the Green Party would be a convenient alibi for his troubles with the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">When I searched the Oireachtas website today for references to "John Gormley" and "Mahon tribunal" I found 36 references.  One of the references I came across was his speech on the Green Party website when he spoke about "Planet Bertie".  That is the place he now inhabits.  He is the man who opens the door currently to "Planet Bertie".  He is the man who stands with the sign saying, "Bertie, whatever you want, we will do it, just give us our little jobs in Cabinet".  Despite being the Minister with responsibility for planning matters and being the leader of his party, Deputy Gormley seems to think he has no responsibility to hold the Taoiseach to account even when it appears the Taoiseach has not paid his taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">I want to make it crystal clear what the Green Party, as well as the Progressive Democrats and the Independents, are supporting today if they back Fianna Fáil.  When asked by the tribunal that if he were to attend an Irish function similar to the famous Manchester dinner, an event which it now looks likely never even happened, and someone were to offer him an envelope with a large sum of money, whether he would accept it——</p>

          <p eId="para_734">He continued, "I might have then.  If there were similar circumstances then before all the new rules I probably would have."  That is the ethical standard that the Green Party sees fit to support.  It is not the belief that it is wrong to take money that is stopping him accepting wads of cash in brown envelopes, it is the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Prior to his election the Minister, Deputy Gormley, told his party conference that on "Planet Bertie" one can get loans from people that one does not have to repay and spend £50,000 without a bank account.  It seems that in 2008 one can do exactly the same on "Planet John".  That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">To give him his due, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been less than willing to be a party to the Fianna Fáil mantra.  On Newstalk last week he said the Green Party consistently had confidence in the Mahon tribunal.  He went on to say that he had always said the tribunal was, is and should act independently and without bias.  It was set up by the Oireachtas to do exactly that.  I was perplexed then that he did not see fit to support Fine Gael's motion today but then I remembered that he is a member of the Green Party and he does what Fianna Fáil tells him.  The man who once would be President is now reduced to a political slave.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Both Green Party Cabinet Ministers continually harp on about letting the tribunals do their work.  This line was first uttered by the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent who, as soon as he was ensconced in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, had a Pauline conversion in his attitude to the Taoiseach's finances.  In September, Deputy Sargent asked Fine Gael what had changed since the general election that brought us to move a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach.  Let me tell him.  In mid-May, around the time Deputy Sargent was describing the Taoiseach as a dead man walking, the Taoiseach said he had co-operated fully with the tribunal and given it all the explanations it needed.  We now know that was not true.  We also know now that the sum of money we are dealing with is not £48,000 but in today's terms is much closer to €300,000.  We are now aware the tribunal threatened the Taoiseach with a summons due to his failure to give it the information it requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I say to Deputy Sargent that this is pretty important stuff.  I am sorry he is not in the Chamber to hear me.  Now it is time to ask him a question.  Is Deputy Sargent happy?  Is the Green Party happy with the position the country is now in?  Is the Green Party happy to be the bulwark of Fianna Fáil?  Is it the mudguard of Fianna Fáil?  Is it the Green mudguard of this Government?  The truth of the matter is that the Green Party has failed utterly in all of its principles.  The Green Party betrayed everything it said on this side of the House once it went over there.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I put it to the 16 absent Ministers, the two Ministers of State who are present, to the absent members of the Green Party and to the Progressive Democrats, and in the presence of the great "dog days of Mahon" himself, Deputy Finian McGrath, who must have blown his whistle because they are afraid to come in, that the country deserves better Government than what we have.  It is not acceptable in a democracy for the Taoiseach, the leader of the country, not to be tax compliant.  In Britain Peter Hain resigned.  Around the world in every single democracy we can think of it is not acceptable that a leader would do what the Taoiseach has done and treat the tribunal the way in which he has treated it.  Let everybody support the Fine Gael motion.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_740">It is with great pleasure that I have the opportunity to support this motion and to demonstrate my support and the support of my party for the good work being done in Dublin Castle by the Mahon tribunal and, in particular, to demonstrate our revulsion at and to reject the attacks made by Ministers and Government Deputies on the tribunal and the work it has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The tribunal was set up to investigate certain planning irregularities that occurred in this city.  It is important to understand — we often forget this in these debates — that the planning and other corruption that occurred in the State over the past 20 years has not been a victimless crime.  Constituents such as mine spend two hours a day commuting to work on a regular basis.  Children in many parishes in my constituency do not have schools to which to go.  This is as a direct result of the kind of corruption practised by former Deputies Liam Lawlor and Ray Burke, and various members of the party opposite, and also the kind of activities which were condoned and to which a blind eye was turned by the Taoiseach.  That is why it is so important that we have these tribunals.  It is not just about accounts and money.  It is about how this really impacts on people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The tribunal, during its investigations, discovered a money trail relating to unusual lodgements to the Taoiseach's accounts.  The Taoiseach could not explain — in writing, in private interview or in public session — the source of these lodgements.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">This approach — the following of the money trail — is one that was endorsed by the Taoiseach in 1997, where he stated clearly in this Chamber that the Government considers that following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry.  I am pleased that this is exactly what the tribunals are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">If the truth be told, the only reason the Members and Ministers opposite have insisted on attacking the tribunal is because the tribunal is getting too close to the truth.  It is starting to shine a light into dark corners of Irish politics that have remained obscured to us for the past 20 years and every time there is a bad news day for the Taoiseach in the castle, Ministers are wheeled out, one after another, to attack the tribunal and to move the focus away from the truths that have been revealed there.  Minister after Minister, in a campaign orchestrated by the Government press secretary, has come out to tell us that the tribunal has an agenda, that it is biased, that the questions are prurient, prying and personal, that it is a soap opera and, in the case of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that it is corrosive cruelty dressed up as a principled inquiry.  Last night, we even had one member of the Government parties tell us that it was not even a legal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">This is a far cry from the Fianna Fáil, and from the principles, that were promised to us in 1997.  In his Ard-Fheis speech before he became Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern told us:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_746">Fianna Fáil will enforce a new set of standards for all its members.  We will not tolerate any deviation from the benchmarks of honour at local level or in Leinster House, be it in the past, the present or the future.  No one — no one — is welcome in this party if they betray the public trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Yet no one has betrayed the public trust more than the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Where do the Ministers stand in this affair?  We have Ministers who, essentially, have almost nothing to say about the Taoiseach's activities.  All they will speak about is the tribunal.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Cowen's only defence of his actions is to claim that he is motivated by loyalty.  There was somebody else who was motivated by loyalty, namely the Taoiseach, the man who was Charles Haughey's Chief Whip, bagman and protégé, and who signed his blank cheques.  The scale may be different but the principle is the same — somebody using loyalty as an excuse to advance their own political aims, somebody who is too afraid to stand up for what is right because they may not have their ambitions satisfied in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has nothing to say about the attacks on the tribunals or the injustices that have occurred as a result of this corruption.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who is supposed to set an example for young people, stated she does not see anything wrong with somebody receiving large amounts of money in dark rooms for personal use.  The Ministers, Deputies Ó Cuív and O'Dea, go out of their way to show how independent and principled they are when it comes to voting against European treaties or to standing up for local interests such as Shannon, taxi drivers or whatever.  Where is their independence, their honour and their ability to take a brave stand when it comes to standing up for what is right in our society?</p>

          <p eId="para_752">Like all the Members in this House, I share some concerns about the tribunals.  I share concerns about the costs and the time taken.  However, the reason the costs have escalated is because of the non co-operation by various Members opposite with the tribunal and the failure of the Government to limit the legal fees.  The same applies to the time taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Like everyone in Ireland, I want to move on from this issue.  I do not want to spend the first week in every Dáil session speaking about tribunals and having confidence debates.  Ireland has changed phenomenally in the past 20 years and, with a few exceptions, it has changed for the better.  However, there is one aspect of Ireland that has not changed and that is more or less the same, namely, our politics.  There is still the same cute hoorism, the same clientelism, the same hypocrisy, the same corruption and the same favouritism that has existed for several decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I want to move on from this era.  I want to move on from this Haughey, Lawlor, Burke and Ahern era of politics, but if the Taoiseach survives this, it makes useless all the tribunals, all the ethics Acts and everything through which we have gone for the past ten years.  If the Taoiseach survives this, the message goes out to an entirely new generation of politicians that this is okay, one can get away with this, one's colleagues will back you up, the public will not vote you out, it does not matter really, and all this matter of ethics is just for show.  That is why it is so important that the tribunal continues its work and that the Taoiseach should not be allowed to get away with these low standards.  It is important so that we create a clean break in our society and move on to a different form of politics to reflect the modern Ireland in which we now live.  We cannot move on so long as Ministers attack the tribunal and continue to support the Taoiseach.  We cannot move on so long as Deputies opposite continue to defend a Taoiseach who they know to be unfit for office.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Responsibility falls particularly on the Cabinet in this matter, and particularly on the Tánaiste.  The time has now come for those colleagues to put aside loyalty and planned defences and to go to the Taoiseach in the same way as Thatcher's Ministers had to go to her when she had gone too far, in the same way as former Taoiseach Haughey's Ministers had to go to him when he had gone too far and in the same way as former Taoiseach Reynold's Ministers had to go to him and state that they had crossed the line, it was too far and it was time to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The famous and over-quoted phrase of a man who was a member of the preceding Parliament of this, whose statue now faces Trinity College on College Green, is that all that is needed for evil to succeed is that good men do nothing.  Perhaps today we are not far off that in many ways in the succeeding Parliament to that Parliament which sat in College Green.  All that is needed for corruption to triumph, all that is needed for wrongdoing to prosper and all that is needed for the truth to be hidden is for the Tánaiste to do nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">The tribunal was mandated to examine certain specific activities and also to investigate any other matters that came to its attention that could amount to corrupt acts in the period since June 1985.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Two Acts from 1998 allowed for the changing of a tribunal's terms of reference, at the request of the tribunal or following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of a Minister.  Subsequently, in July 1998, at the request of the planning tribunal, its terms of reference were further expanded to give it a mandate to investigate any allegation of corruption associated with the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">In June 2001, the then sole member of the tribunal,  Justice Flood, in anticipation of extensive future public inquiries, requested the appointment of further members to the tribunal.  The Government responded to this request by making provision in a 2002 Act that enabled additional members to be appointed to a tribunal.  On foot of this, two additional members were appointed to the planning tribunal in October 2002, one of them the current chairman, Judge Mahon.  It was necessary to introduce a further Act in 2004 to ensure that Judge Mahon, as the then new chairperson of the tribunal, could make orders regarding applications for costs incurred during the tenure of the preceding chairman.  A separate Act in May 2004 provided, among other things, that a tribunal consisting of more than one member might act in divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Notwithstanding the fact that the tribunal was expanded to comprise three members, its subsequent work, based on its terms of reference, proved very unwieldy.  The tribunal published a fourth interim report in June 2004, which gave a broad overview of the work then on hand and indicated that there remained a large volume of work in respect of which public hearings had not yet begun.  The tribunal indicated that it could see this work carrying on until 2014 or 2015.  Accordingly, it requested changes to its terms of reference to allow it more discretion in the issues that it investigated or chose not to pursue, so as to shorten the anticipated duration of its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">In November 2004, the tribunal's terms of reference were amended accordingly, in agreement with the tribunal, and an Act was brought forward to give necessary legal backing to the wider discretion being granted to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">At that time, the Government also approved the provision of additional resources to the tribunal and a significant increase in the size of its internal legal team.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Earlier, in July 2004, the Government decided on a new reduced scale of fees for new and existing tribunals' legal teams.  Following discussion between the Attorney General and the planning tribunal, it was agreed that, with the benefit of the changed terms of reference, the tribunal would seek to complete its work by end-March 2007.  It was agreed that the revised fee rates would apply to its legal team in respect of any subsequent period.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">In anticipation of the March 2007 deadline, the chairman of the tribunal wrote in December 2006 to my predecessor, Deputy Dick Roche, to the effect that the tribunal's public hearings would not be completed by 31 March 2007, principally due to a number of legal challenges which had delayed its work.  The chairman anticipated that public hearings for the remaining modules which the tribunal intended to conduct would extend until the end of 2007 and possibly into the first months of 2008.  He requested that existing funding arrangements and fee scales would continue to apply for 2007.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">I should also remind the House that, beyond providing support to the planning tribunal in its specific inquiries, there have been significant developments over the past decade in the legislative and regulatory framework governing the conduct of public representatives and public servants generally, aimed at reinforcing public confidence in the standards by which the country is governed.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 extended the existing rules relating to ethics for planning authority staff.  The Local Government Act 2001 provides a comprehensive ethics framework for local government employees and councillors.  It updated and developed the previous law, taking account of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, and came into effect in 2003.  As its starting principle, the Act provides that it is the duty of every councillor and employee to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest.</p>

The timescale of the tribunal is lengthy and the costs are significant.  Nevertheless, we must be conscious of the fact that the planning tribunal has conducted its business within the current statutory framework governing tribunals, and the specific remit imposed under its terms of reference.

          <p eId="para_801">With the prospect of a reasonably imminent conclusion of the tribunal's public hearings, and conscious that the bulk of its ultimate costs have already been incurred, the focus of the House should be to recognise and respond to the lessons that may be adduced from the experience with this and other recent tribunals.  For that reason, the Government's amendment urges the early consideration and enactment of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005, which is currently at Second Stage in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I am aware of the Opposition suggestion that a provision of this Bill that would empower a Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, by order to dissolve a tribunal, is intended to apply to the planning tribunal.  This is emphatically not the case.  In bringing the Bill before the house last November, my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was explicit in this regard.  He stated clearly:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_803">The purpose of this legislation is not in any way to interfere with the current tribunals.  Its purpose is to reassure the public that were the Oireachtas to resolve to establish tribunals in the future, they would perform under a modern code of legislation which regulated their operations.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_805">The Bill does no more than make explicit the existing implicit entitlement of the Oireachtas by resolution to dissolve a tribunal that it had established.  The Tribunals of Inquiry Bill is based to a significant extent on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, which carried out a comprehensive examination of tribunal legislation and in May 2005 published its report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry.  The report provides a well reasoned and well informed basis for recommendations for reform.  There are over 50 recommendations which are designed to ensure the efficient and effective management of tribunals and cover areas ranging from the establishment of tribunals, the setting of terms of reference for tribunals, membership of tribunals, procedures at tribunals, preparation and publication of reports of tribunals and, of course, an issue of major concern to the Government, namely, the costs, particularly the legal costs, of tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Bill represents a comprehensive reform of the tribunal legislation.  In summary, it contains the following significant features: the process for setting and amending terms of reference of a tribunal is clarified; within three months of its establishment, a tribunal will be required to produce a statement of estimated costs and duration of the tribunal which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas — this statement must be subsequently amended after significant developments; the Government, for stated reasons and following a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, will be able to suspend or dissolve a tribunal; provisions governing the taking of evidence, including a provision regarding the "reading-in" of evidence already available in written form and not disputed; the position with regard to the granting of legal representation before a tribunal is clarified to the effect that a relevant person must apply for representation and the tribunal will only grant the application where the person's legal or constitutional rights are likely to be significantly affected by the proceedings; the tribunal will state its opinion as to the numbers of the representation to be retained by a person that it will certify as being recoverable from the State; the responsible Minister will be able to request an interim report on the general progress of an inquiry, or of a particular aspect of an inquiry, from the tribunal——</p>

          <p eId="para_808">——tribunal reports will be admissible in civil cases — the findings of facts in a report or the opinions expressed therein are <i>prima facie </i>evidence unless the contrary is shown; the position with regard to award of costs by a tribunal is clarified and co-operation with the tribunal remains the key determinant for an award of costs; and regulations, to be made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will set out maximum amounts of legal costs recoverable.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">In particular, Part 5 of the Bill contains many new provisions dealing with the proceedings of tribunals, which should have the effect of making them speedier and by extension less costly.  Section 18 requires a tribunal to carry out its functions as efficiently, effectively and expeditiously as practicable having regard to its terms of reference.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">I am happy to proceed.  Overall, the proposed Bill will contribute positively to a more effective future operation of public inquiries.  It provides for a comprehensive statutory framework governing all aspects of a tribunal, from the time of its establishment to the publication of its final report, and its enactment will further the public interest and public accountability, and underpin the confidence of the public and the Oireachtas in any future tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The genesis and justification for the planning tribunal are well known.  Allegations of acts of bribery and corruption in the planning process and unlawful payments being made to secure votes on rezoning decisions must become things of the past.  Good planning is a necessity and not an option when it comes to the future development of this country.  Decisions must be made openly and transparently and be taken in the best interests of the public.  As Minister, I will insist that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I will examine whether changes are required to strengthen the decision making process by local authorities in the zoning of land so that decisions are clearly arrived at, are evidence based and secure the necessary economic, environmental and social benefits for local communities.  I will further strengthen the planning system so that the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, development plans and local area planning are fully aligned in practice so the huge Exchequer funding committed by this Government under the national development plan to water, sewerage, public transport and roads will see them delivered in the right places and in a co-ordinated and timely manner.  I will continue to work closely with my colleagues in Government so that fast growing areas are provided with the schools, public transport, open spaces, play areas and other community facilities they need in parallel with housing development and not as an afterthought.  I will ensure, through the local government reform process, that any further steps required to strengthen the ethics regime in the local government system are taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I conclude by reiterating that successive Governments over the past decade have supported and facilitated the planning tribunal in every respect as it pursues its very detailed and comprehensive investigations——</p>

          <p eId="para_834">It is over ten years since this House resolved, on 7 October 1997, to establish a tribunal to inquire urgently into and to make findings and recommendations on definite matters of urgent public importance.  If a week is a long time in politics, ten years is a lifetime.  Over the course of that decade the tribunal has published four interim reports.  It has conducted countless hours in public session and even longer in private sittings.  The tribunal has the terms of reference, expertise, experience, resources, legal guidance and all the components necessary to enable it to discharge the task the Dáil set for it.  Over those ten years the tribunal has had the support of the Dáil and it will continue to have that support.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">According to its own timetable, the tribunal is now nearing a point where it can report to the House and complete the task we set for it.  This it should do, unhindered by any political manoeuvrings.  The tribunals was established to ‘‘inquire urgently" into matters of "urgent public importance".  The word "urgent" was used twice deliberately in the first few lines of the tribunal's terms of reference.  It has been alleged by some that we are expected to accept some extraordinary things arising from the proceedings of the tribunal.  I submit, however, that the most extraordinary thing we are expected to accept is that an investigation which is now in its 11th year is being conducted urgently.  While much of the delay was due to the actions of others——</p>

          <p eId="para_837">——the tribunal itself is also not without blame.  Fortunately for public life in this country, the Government did not sit back awaiting the final report of the tribunal and proceeded to take action by introducing a number of significant reforms in the areas where the tribunal will make further recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The purpose and terms of reference, as set out by Dáil Éireann, were clear and unambiguous.  Yet, when Members of the House, as opposed to just about everybody else, dare to voice the not unreasonable concern that the tribunal appears, at times, to be straying into areas outside its remit and not conducting its business as efficiently and expeditiously as this House intended and directed, we are accused of intimidating and undermining the tribunal and questioning the process.  To make reference to the fact that the tribunal has made mistakes does not equate to undermining the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Do the Opposition Deputies believe that Miss Justice Denham was attempting to torpedo, thwart, undermine or intimidate the tribunal when she said on 4 July 2007, in the case of O'Callaghan <i>v.</i> Mahon: “The fact that the tribunal is still inquiring ten years later is the antithesis of an urgent public inquiry”?  Do they think this was the intent of Mr. Justice O’Neill’s High Court ruling, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in March 2005, that the tribunal’s actions: “amounts to a failure by the [Tribunal] to observe and protect... [certain parties’]... rights to fair procedures and to natural and constitutional justice”?  The tribunal had been in operation and doing that for seven years, according to the Supreme Court.  Do they believe this was what motivated Mr. Justice Hardiman’s criticisms of the tribunal in his judgment of 30 March 2007?  Not only did he find that the tribunal’s procedures were “extraordinarily unfair”, but he also observed “that it is a reasonable inference [from the withholding of the material of certain people before the tribunal] that the Tribunal have indeed prejudged certain vital issues”.  That is a very serious charge from a Supreme Court judge.  Mr. Justice Hardiman went on to conclude that the tribunal had “suppressed” certain material and referred to “the profoundly flawed nature of this Tribunal’s procedures and the insensitivity to the requirements of justice for [certain parties] which that produced”.</p>

Mahon Tribunal was incorrect”.  That approach was maintained for seven years.  The distinguished jurist, former Fine Gael Minister and former Attorney General, the late Professor John M. Kelly, argued in his authoritative work, <i>The Irish Constitution</i>, that “criticism of the Courts is permissible”.  That quotation can be found on page 933 of the latest edition of that book.  Professor Kelly quoted various legal cases and judgments in support of his proposition not only that people should be allowed to criticise the courts but also that it should be welcomed.</p>

Our observations have been largely concerned with a number of specific areas — the costs, the discovery of material, the nature of some questioning and the leaks of confidential material.  I have already referred to the discovery issue.

When the tribunal's counsel asks a question, Fine Gael quotes it as a tribunal finding.

          <p eId="para_863">Another aspect of this matter that should concern all of us is the constant leaking of tribunal information.  The tribunal pointed out in a statement earlier this month that the "unauthorised disclosure of confidential information in advance of public hearings . . . . . may also be perceived . . . . . as potentially damaging the reputation and integrity of the tribunal".  These are the tribunal's words, rather than my words, but I wholeheartedly agree with them.  The leaking of such material, and its misuse by members of the main Opposition party in pursuit of their personal vendetta, has done more to damage the reputation and integrity of the tribunal than any comment from anyone on this side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">There is a considerable volume of jurisprudence, in Ireland and overseas, on how tribunals should conduct their business.  As Mr. Justice Moriarty, who knows something about such matters, said in a recent judgment:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">It cannot be emphasised too often that tribunal proceedings are not adversarial but inquisitorial.  They are not a means of establishing criminal or civil liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">He went on to quote Mr. Justice Hardiman in O'Callaghan <i>v</i>. Mahon:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_868">A Tribunal in the end of the day merely reports its opinions and makes recommendations.  It does not make binding findings of fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">He also quoted from the comments of Mr. Justice Cory, speaking as a member of the Canadian Supreme Court, in a landmark decision about tribunals:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_870">The Inquiry's roles of investigation and education of the public are of great importance.  Yet those roles should not be fulfilled at the expense of the denial of the rights of those being investigated.  This means that no matter how important the work of an Inquiry may be, it cannot be achieved at the expense of the fundamental right of each citizen to be treated fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">It is abundantly clear from the plethora of press releases produced by the Opposition parties that they are prepared to jettison the fundamental right of each citizen to be treated fairly as long as it gives them an opportunity to pillory or defame their political opponents.  Fine Gael has been spewing out press releases and statements.  Initially it asked for issues to be dealt with publicly by the Taoiseach before the tribunal completed its report.  More recently, however, its statements have descended into nasty personal invective.</p>

          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_947">I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_948">To delete paragraphs 4 to 7 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_949">shares the public concern about the potential costs of the tribunal and, having regard to the comments made by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, in which he described the legal fees as "astronomical" and "a gravy train", deplores the failure of the Government to take action to reduce the level of legal fees for tribunals generally;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_950">urges the further postponement by the Oireachtas of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005, pending the completion of the work of the tribunal;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_951">welcomes the opportunity to discuss the procedures and practices involved in investigating matters mandated by Oireachtas Éireann; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_952">condemns the leaking of tribunal documents by whatever parties or persons may be responsible as an infringement of the rights of those affected, notes the strong denial by the tribunal that it was responsible for any such leaks, and supports appropriate action to investigate such leaks, and further confirms the right to confidentiality to which each citizen is entitled in their correspondence with the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The motion being debated by the House is very simple: "That Dáil Éireann reaffirms its confidence in the Mahon tribunal, and its belief that the tribunal is acting independently, without bias and within the remit contained in the terms of reference set by the Oireachtas."  The Government has decided to submit an amendment deleting the reference to the tribunal's acting independently and to the House's belief that the tribunal is acting without bias.  The Labour Party has proposed an amendment to the Government amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, had a lot to say about motives and ascribed motives to the proposers of the motion.  He talked about the costs of the tribunal and its procedures and method of operation.  What I find remarkable about the contribution of the Minister and those of many Ministers in the past couple of months is that they have only belatedly become concerned about costs.  The costs of the tribunal were agreed and the legal fees were set by the Government.  The Government intended to reduce the legal fees of the tribunals and the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, announced a new and reduced set of legal fees as far back as 2004, but the Government of which the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is a member decided to ditch that and continue the existing scale of legal fees.  It is cant and hypocrisy for Ministers to start belly-aching now about the cost of the tribunals when they agreed the legal fees.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_956">This Government has been responsible for the conduct of the tribunal and for its terms of reference for the entire ten years of its existence.  On occasion, the Government takes credit for having brought the terms of reference and <i>modus operandi</i> of the tribunals before the House.  Again, the timing is interesting.  After ten years during which many witnesses have appeared before the tribunal and it has faced many legal challenges, when do Ministers suddenly become concerned about its procedures and practices?  It is when their Taoiseach is before the tribunal and finds himself getting deeper and deeper into a hole.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">Let us be clear about what has been happening for the past couple of months.  The Government, or at least its Fianna Fáil element, has decided to mount an attack on the flank of the tribunal in order, at the very least, to distract attention from the Taoiseach's appearances before it and possibly to cause a collapse of the tribunal, and certainly to take away public confidence in its work and in the importance of what it is doing.  In doing so, it is engaging in a profoundly political act, at the centre of which is the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">It is unacceptable that the financial affairs of one man, even if he is the Taoiseach, should paralyse the politics of this country and leave the affairs of the Irish people neglected.  I am sick of the twists and turns, half-explanations, half-truths and untruths, and I am tired of the fairy tales, crocodile tears, red herrings and manufactured outrage.  I am sick and tired of it, but I cannot ignore it.  As an Opposition party in a parliamentary democracy, we cannot ignore the fact that the Taoiseach has not provided a credible account of his affairs to a tribunal of inquiry set up by the Dáil.  We cannot ignore the fact that he cannot produce a tax clearance certificate as required by law or that he and his Ministers are engaged in a concerted campaign to undermine the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">We cannot ignore the fact that the Progressive Democrats and Green Party Ministers, with manifest and breathtaking hypocrisy, have abandoned their duty to democracy and, like the three monkeys, decided to see, hear and speak no evil.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who is the line Minister responsible for the tribunal, gave one of the most pathetic speeches I have heard in a long time.  The political leader and Minister who has been a champion of good planning and integrity in politics, rather than contributing to the debate or giving a speech that meant anything, was reduced to reading out the explanatory memorandum of a Bill that he said when he was in opposition he would oppose to the last.  I do not believe it is a case of the Green Party having changed its political colour since it went into Government, although there is growing evidence of a tinge of yellow around the edges, I just think it is not up to the job.  Fianna Fáil is running rings around the Green Party and for those of us who have some respect for that party, its politics and what it stands for, it is a pathetic sight to see a Minister come in here to be walked on and then cut and run after he has delivered his speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">This motion and the controversy that prompted it are entirely of the Taoiseach's making.  We are talking about this issue again because of the actions of the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  We would not be here if the Taoiseach had done what he has always professed to do, co-operate fully with the tribunal and give a credible explanation for the substantial sums of money he received in the early 1990s.  We would of course be much better occupied in dealing with the problems arising from the turmoil in the financial markets, the job losses in Arklow, the problems in the health service and the rising crime levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">It is extraordinary that the Opposition must introduce a motion reaffirming confidence in a tribunal of inquiry established by the Oireachtas on the basis of a resolution originally introduced by the Government.  We find ourselves in this unique position because of the attacks launched by a succession of Ministers on the independence and impartiality of the tribunal and, by implication, the integrity of the members of the tribunal and the legal staff working for it.  The attacks commenced last September after the Taoiseach's first uncomfortable session in the witness box and built up into a crescendo of accusations, vituperation and common abuse in a series of media appearances by senior Government personnel following the Taoiseach's pre-Christmas appearances in Dublin Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Let us recall some of the comments and accusations made by Ministers.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, described the questioning of the Taoiseach as petty, personal, prurient and voyeuristic, and accused the tribunal of trampling on the Taoiseach's rights.  According to the Minister of State, the way in which the tribunal conducted its business was unacceptable in a democratic society.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was "astonished" at the line of questioning of the Taoiseach, while the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, who is always willing to go the extra mile, complained about "invasive questioning" and said he expected the tribunal any day soon to question the Taoiseach about his Communion money.  Just before Christmas, radio stations and news programmes found themselves in an extraordinary situation in which Government press representatives were ringing them up and offering representation from senior Ministers who wanted to have a go at the tribunal.  It is surely unprecedented in any democratic society that a succession of Ministers would try to destroy a tribunal of inquiry established under law by the national Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">These attacks on the tribunal also represent a significant change of approach by Fianna Fáil.  Since the first disclosures in the autumn of 2006 about the receipt of large sums of money by the Taoiseach from a number of wealthy businessmen at a time when he held the sensitive post of Minister for Finance, the Greek chorus from the Cabinet said with one voice that we should leave all these matters to the tribunal and judgment should be deferred until the report is published.  However, when they found the Taoiseach floundering and unconvincing in the witness box, producing a series of contradictory accounts of the sources and purpose of the various moneys he received, and particularly when they found that the public was totally unconvinced by the accounts given by their leader, their approach changed.  It was no longer good enough to leave matters to the tribunal.  The tribunal had to be attacked and undermined.  It was a classic case of the best form of defence being attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">After the Taoiseach's appearance before the Mahon tribunal at the end of September, I said that I had not found his evidence credible.  The majority of the country agrees with that assessment.  After two further days in the witness box, the Taoiseach's credibility has not improved.  The cracks that have emerged in his account of the various "dig-outs" and loans grow into gaping holes.  As a result, the Taoiseach's credibility is increasingly eroded and his authority to govern is increasingly undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">The fact is that the Taoiseach is being treated no differently by the tribunal from any other politician at local or national level who had to appear before it.  If an allegation is made against a politician that a corrupt payment was made and received, the tribunal looks at the politician's finances to see whether there is any evidence of such a payment.  If, as in the Taoiseach's case, there is evidence that large sums of money were received by him during the directly relevant period, then the politician must account for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">With all the questioning on why the tribunal is asking the Taoiseach about personal money and his marriage, matters nobody wants to go into, let us understand what is happening.  A witness at the tribunal claimed that Deputy Bertie Ahern took a bribe of £80,000.  That is the allegation.  The tribunal must examine his accounts and it does this for everybody against whom an accusation is made.  If it finds, as in this case, that at the time in question the Taoiseach received large sums of money from wherever, which coincidentally amount to £80,000, it asks where he got it.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, has offered as an explanation a combination of "dig-out" money from friends, money from Manchester and the money Mr. Mick Wall brought in a suitcase and put on his table in the Drumcondra office.  To put it mildly, the tribunal is having difficulty believing this and, therefore, it has put him on the stand and asked him questions to probe his account.  He is not being treated any differently from anybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">I remember a young woman who had to go into that tribunal and explain a wedding gift she received because her father was a member of Dublin County Council at the time when somebody had alleged he had received money.  I felt sorry for the people involved.  He told the tribunal the money was a wedding gift for his daughter and she was brought in and made to answer questions.  There is no doubt that this is all very invasive, but that is the job this House gave the tribunal because up to that point in time nobody could crack the allegations of corruption in the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">Over the years, there were allegations again and again that the planning process, particularly in Dublin, was being corrupted.  In the 1970s, a journalist named Mr. Joe McAnthony wrote a series of articles in which he named some of the people, who subsequently went to prison over it, as being involved in corruption.  He was effectively driven out of the country to seek a living abroad.  In the late 1980s, a similar round of allegations was made and there were two sets of Garda inquiries, one of which brought a senior planning official before the courts.  There was no conviction and a second Garda investigation similarly ran into the sand.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">One of the interesting pieces of evidence Mr. Frank Dunlop gave and repeated a number of times recently was that when the planning tribunal was originally set up, all the great worthies thought it would go nowhere and that they could waffle their way in front of it.  Only when the tribunal, using the powers this House gave it, examined the accounts did Mr. Dunlop come before it and give his explanation.  The tribunal produced his accounts, his "war chest", and there was the famous day when he went out, became ill and eventually came in and told what he had to tell.  These invasive powers, which this House gave the tribunal, caused it to crack open for the first time the extent to which bribery and corruption was involved in planning in County Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">This is not a vague exercise going on in Dublin Castle which only people involved in planning, local Government or public administration understand.  This is about people's quality of lives, the length of time it takes them to get to work in this city because of the sprawls created around its edges without adequate transport.  This is about the problem parents have in September when they cannot get their children in to a school because housing estates were built for the benefit of property developers and the lands rezoned for the benefit of landowners rather than the interests of the wider public who would inhabit them.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">It may have taken ten years, but the public domain would never have cracked the practice of corruption and bribery at the heart of planning in Dublin and perhaps wider were it not for the powers given to the tribunal.  These are the powers the Taoiseach complains are unfair to him and Ministers say are too invasive and go into areas they should not.  The reason the tribunal is pursuing a line of questioning with the Taoiseach about his personal finances and affairs 15 years ago is because he has not to date been able to explain where he got money around the same time that another witness alleges he took a bribe in connection with a planning matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">The tribunal is following the money trail, an approach recommended by the Taoiseach when the planning tribunal was established in 1997.  Moving the Dáil motion for the establishment of the tribunal on 10 September 1997, the Taoiseach said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_973">The Government considers that following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry as witnessed by the great success of the Dunnes payment tribunal which adopted this approach.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_974">The terms of reference of the new tribunal are geared towards following the "money trail" rather than examining particular allegations concerning specific public, ministerial or Government decisions, so that we do not necessarily drag in innocent third parties or, on the other hand, omit decisions that may turn out to have been tainted.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The concerted attack on the tribunal by Fianna Fáil must not be allowed to divert attention from the central issue.  The fact is that the Taoiseach has been unable to come up with a credible explanation for the huge sums of cash he received at a time when he held the key post of Minister for Finance.  More recent revelations in a Sunday newspaper regarding the Taoiseach's tax affairs raise new and extremely serious issues for him.  If these reports are correct — despite his own gloss on events, the Taoiseach seems to concede they largely are — it becomes very hard to avoid the conclusion that the Dáil was seriously misled by the Taoiseach on the status of his tax affairs, particularly when he made a statement to the House in September 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">The Taoiseach has effectively confirmed that, in a letter sent on his behalf by his tax adviser in the autumn of 2006, he asked that his reply to Revenue queries should be treated as a "voluntary disclosure" of his tax liabilities.  A request to Revenue to be treated as having made a voluntary disclosure immediately raises the question: a disclosure of what?  One does not seek to make a voluntary disclosure to the Revenue unless one believes some tax liability might arise.  A fully compliant taxpayer need not seek the sort of protections that arise when Revenue grants voluntary disclosure status.  A compliant taxpayer does not need protection from being named as a defaulter, to seek mitigation of penalties liable to be imposed on him or her, to seek a monetary settlement in lieu of prosecution or to seek an assurance that any statements made by him or her in connection with the disclosure would not be used in evidence against him or her in any subsequent criminal prosecution.  These are the assurances given by the Revenue when a voluntary disclosure is made.  This request can only be read as an indication that the Taoiseach, or somebody acting on his behalf, had — at the very least — apprehensions that he was not fully tax compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">A central question facing the Taoiseach is how he could have been seeking in 2006 to make a voluntary disclosure about tax affairs dating back to 1992 when during the interim period, specifically in 2002, he made a formal statutory declaration that his affairs were in order and that he was entitled to a tax clearance certificate.  Last week, the Taoiseach was quoted as saying "I made a voluntary disclosure and I think that the Revenue have accepted that position".  This claim, that the letter from his tax adviser had in fact been accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as a voluntary disclosure, was heavily qualified by him in the House earlier today.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">In conclusion, the Labour Party supports the motion before the House.  We are astonished at the amendment which has been submitted by the Government, which is why we have tabled an amendment to it, in turn.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
            <p eId="para_979">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the difficulties regarding Monaghan General Hospital.  It was with absolute shock that I and my constituents read of the HSE proposals for the winding down of services at Monaghan General Hospital, in spite of the fact that no alternatives are available.  We were assured by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and by Professor Drumm on many occasions that no services would be removed until as good, if not better, alternative services were available.  The proposal to take Monaghan General Hospital off call, that is, to close the medical and treatment casualty room, the precise date for which is to be confirmed, is totally unacceptable and unjustified, in light of the fact that the new high-quality treatment room, together with two refurbished wards, are capable of giving excellent results.  This was particularly true up until such time as the HSE removed two consultants from the hospital.  That was done at a time when the Minister was advising that we need 400 extra consultants, rather than junior doctors.  There appears to be one law for the Minister's hospitals and another for Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">I ask the Minister and the general public to examine what has happened in Monaghan General Hospital.  A high quality, well equipped treatment casualty room was built four years ago, at a cost of approximately €1.5 million.  It was opened for service less than 18 months ago and is now being wound down.  The female medical ward was completely refurbished four years ago, to the highest specifications and contains approximately 30 beds.  That ward is now completely closed, with high-quality beds in private storage, while patients lie on trolleys in Cavan and Drogheda.  The coronary care ward in Monaghan General Hospital has five to six beds constantly in use.  That ward has been proven by independent surveys to have a higher record of safety and service than any other similar facility in the country, yet the Minister for Health and Children, who is not here tonight, together with the HSE, is suggesting that one bed in either Drogheda or Cavan will cover the needs of the people of Monaghan.  So much for patient care and patient safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Just before Christmas the hospital alliance met senior HSE personnel but were not even advised that two consultants had been given their notice.  They were further told that the maternity ward was to be restructured into a high-care unit.  Even when I visited the hospital a few weeks ago to discuss the situation regarding the two consultants, I was assured that the high-care unit would be restructured in the former maternity unit.  I subsequently found out that the unit was already being used for other purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The absent Minister was entrusted with the management of approximately €16 billion of taxpayers' money.  Can she advise how it is that when the country was literally broke, 30 years ago, a small number of administrators could employ sufficient nurses, consultants, doctors and so forth, to provide a satisfactory service for the area without any mass administration structures, outside consultants or committees?  Does the Minister or her Department have any interest in or say on patient care?  Do they understand that while home care and home help is only available, in the main, for a few hours a day, sufficient quality home carers are not being employed to do the necessary work?</p>
            <p eId="para_983">I urge the Minister to meet personnel from the Cavan, Monaghan hospital group which is interested in saving lives and avoiding hardship.  During the last period that Monaghan General Hospital was taken off-call, at least 17 lives were lost, without justification.  Today I received a copy of a letter from Mr. Finbar Lennon, former medical adviser to the North Eastern Health Board, which clearly states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_984">. . . the present Teamwork transformation projects have and will inevitably fail.  This is due to the fact that the medium term plan is unrealistic, but also because many vital front line staff have been excluded, by design, from the so-called consultation process.  Their medical and nursing experience and advice has been largely disregarded by the planners and decision makers.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">I humbly suggest that the Minister feels that she has no role regarding patient care and safety on behalf of the people of Monaghan.  In the interest of similar hospitals nationally, she should do the honourable thing and resign.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">I wish to read into the record a very quick statement from the same doctor: "The situation in Drogheda was very unsafe and I call for a fundamental appraisal."  That is how serious the situation is within the health services in the north east.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">The HSE has advised the Department that no decisions have been taken regarding a reduction in services at hospitals in the HSE north-east area, including Monaghan General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">The HSE has indicated that it is facing a challenging year ahead and is exploring how best to deliver services within budget.  Senior managers in the north-east area met recently to discuss budgets for 2008 and how services could be delivered within budget.  A document which was leaked to the media is a draft internal document arising from that meeting which sets out certain options for consideration.  The HSE has advised that it expects to be in a position by mid-February to be more definitive about service provision for the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">I want to emphasise that the Minister has previously been given an assurance by the HSE that in progressing the reconfiguration of services in the north east, including services at Monaghan General Hospital, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">Emergency surgical services on a 24 hour, seven day basis are provided on the Cavan site, while significant elements of diagnostic, outpatient and day case services are provided on the Monaghan Hospital site.  This has resulted in lower waiting times for outpatient appointments and inpatient elective services.  Since the reconfiguration of Cavan-Monaghan surgical services, patients can, if necessary, be seen on the day of referral by their general practitioner to the visiting consultant surgeon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">Monaghan Hospital has an important role to play in the provision of health services in the north east.  This view was confirmed in the Teamwork Management Services Report, Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East, and also in the North East Transformation Programme.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_484">
            <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
            <p eId="para_1002">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue.  After listening to the previous speaker, I could easily spend some time discussing Tallaght Hospital, but I wish to discuss jobs.  I express solidarity with my colleagues in Wicklow, Deputies Doyle and Timmins, who are experiencing the same trauma we in Tallaght suffered last Friday.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, told me today that he shares my concern.  On Friday and today, I raised these matters with the Minister, Deputy Martin, and I made clear to the Taoiseach how upset I am when I spoke with him today.  It happens to every community, but we in Tallaght were shocked by what occurred last week.  In fairness to the main political parties, we worked with the workers and management of Jacob's a number of years ago to create a situation in which proper investment would take place.  I am glad that representatives of the workers are present because I not only have an opportunity to welcome them but to congratulate them on their positive response in recent days.  They have been reasonable and should not be taken advantage of.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Like many of my generation, I remember Jacob's moving from Bishop Street in the inner city to Tallaght.  I moved with an employer nearly 40 years ago and Jacob's came to Tallaght approximately 30 years ago.  Over the years, it created good jobs and was a good employer, but I would not stand over what has occurred in recent years and days.  I want to send a clear message through the Minister that what is occurring in Tallaght is not good enough.  Management should have been more faithful to the loyal staff, many of whom went home last Thursday night believing there were no problems.  They heard rumours overnight and on Friday and were then faced by the dreadful news that 220 production jobs and 40 seasonal jobs are to be shed in the next year or so.  It is a big blow to Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country where there is a young population.  We need job creation, not job losses.  The loss of this number of jobs at Jacob's on Belgard Road upsets the community in a considerable way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  He will be supportive of my efforts in this regard.  Tallaght needs job creation.  These jobs must be replaced by equally good jobs, but we must also give special consideration to the plight of the workers at Jacob's who have been shocked by what has occurred in recent days.  This morning, I explained to workers that I bring my life experiences to my politics.  I apologise for telling the House, but I have been made redundant three times in my life, including twice in Tallaght.  I am not ashamed of my background or my experiences.  I know what it is like for those family members who woke up last Friday morning believing they were in good jobs, but who find themselves in a situation in which they need help.  It is a blow to those people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">On Friday, I was critical of the company.  The €10 million it is promising for redundancies and retraining is not enough and should have been used to modernise the plant.  The company claims that the reason for the job losses is the plant.  It should have been modernising the plant over the years and preserving the jobs.  It needs to come up with more money.  I read in <i>The Sunday Times</i> that the site is worth at least €100 million.  If <i>The Sunday Times</i> states that, it must be right.  It is good to see Deputy Brian Hayes is present to support me.  He is also supportive of the workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">I hope the Department's officials will make contact with the company as quickly as possible to make my concerns clear, namely, that the workers should be protected, properly retrained and get all of the facilities and resources they need to seek further jobs, which will not be easy.  The company must ensure that proper redundancy payments are paid.  I look forward not only to the Minister of State's reply, but to working with him to ensure these deals are kept.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1008">I thank Deputy O'Connor for raising this issue.  Given the way he raises matters on behalf of Tallaght, he will not be made redundant from the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">I was disappointed to hear about the job losses at the company.  I am particularly aware of the significance of the job losses in such a long-established company and every effort will be made to assist the employees in seeking alternative employment.  I understand that a restructuring of the manufacturing activities of the company will lead to a cessation of production at its biscuit factory in Tallaght by early 2009.  The planned restructuring will include an investment programme and the company expects to employ at that stage approximately 120 people in Ireland.  The redundancies at the company will take place on a phased basis from September 2008 through to early 2009.  The role of FÁS, the industrial training agency, will be particularly important.  The agency has already written to the company and is prepared to offer its full range of services to any employees who wish to avail of them.  I understand the company is entering into talks with employees and unions immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Enterprise Ireland has had a number of discussions with the company in the past months regarding the latter's development plans and assistance has been given to its innovation agenda.  Having reviewed a number of options, the company has taken the strategic decision to outsource its biscuit manufacturing operation.  However, the company has also indicated its commitment to undertaking new product development in Ireland by deciding to establish an innovation centre of excellence in biscuit manufacturing.  The agency will seek to continue working with the company to assist it in developing new products and processes and in enhancing its famous range of brands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">A decision by the company to establish an in-house research and development unit and new product development centre is in keeping with Enterprise Ireland's strategy for innovation with the agency's client companies, as innovation is accepted as the key to gaining a competitive advantage in the fast moving consumer goods sector.  A number of added value food processing companies have already established dedicated NPD centres, a move that will serve to strengthen Ireland's most important indigenous industrial sector and copperfasten our reputation as a producer of safe, premium quality and innovative food products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">In the longer term, the future of the company's food and drinks sector will depend on a knowledge-based high added value operation with new product development.  This will be necessary to maintain the sector's competitiveness in a competitive global food market.  To this end, Enterprise Ireland has identified a number of growth areas, such as the fast growing functional foods market, organic products and convenience and specialty foods.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">South-west Dublin continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors and is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with a third level institute and excellent infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle.  The announcement in November 2007 that Microsoft Corporation had selected Grangecastle as the location for its new European data centre was a further indication of Ireland's standing internationally as a global knowledge-based economy.  It was also testament to IDA Ireland and south-west Dublin's commitment to growing next generation businesses in the area.  Also in Grangecastle, the pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma has established the world's largest biopharma campus facility, investing €1.8 billion and currently employing more than 1,300 highly skilled people.  Recently, Wyeth announced that it is investing a further €24 million in the creation of additional dedicated research and development and process development facilities at its Grangecastle campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">The State development agencies will continue to work together and with local interests to promote employment opportunities for Tallaght.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued in the area by the agencies will maximise the flow of potential investors and convert these into job opportunities.  I thank the Deputy, who has a strong commitment to the area.  I express my sympathies to the workers.  Everything that can be done to ensure they find alternative employment or training facilities will be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">I sympathise with the 350 workers at Allergan and their families who received this morning the devastating news that the company will wind down in June 2009.  This is a terrible blow to an area that has suffered several blows previously in terms of Arklow Pottery and Euro Connex.  The latter was supposed to employ approximately 600 people, but has bottomed out at 150 and will not expand.  People in the area are resilient and will bounce back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">I must state on the record that, in 2002, the forerunner of this company stated that it would consolidate its production in Arklow and a grant of approximately €7 million over five years was committed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2003.  I would like to be as magnanimous as Deputy O'Connor but I cannot, because the Government has failed Arklow.  It gave a commitment to decentralise a State agency, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, to Arklow but that has not taken place to date.  The agency is in the process of securing a new headquarters in Dublin with a 20-year lease and a ten-year break clause.  It does not look like it will move to Arklow any time soon.  I wish the Government would come clean in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">Did the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have any forewarning of this closure?  If so, what did he do about it?  I ask him to use all of the departmental and State agencies at his disposal to get replacement work for the area.  IDA Ireland did not visit the site in Wicklow for two years.  I do not know if it has visited one recently.  It is a sad day for Arklow.  The town can bounce back but it needs assistance from State agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1020">Allergan has been established in Arklow since 1980.  It was first known as McGhan Limited and later Inamed Aesthetics.  For the past 18 months it has been under the international company, Allergan.  It was announced today that 350 people or thereabouts will lose their jobs over the next 18 months.  On television this morning, we saw young couples with mortgages where both partners work in this company.  This will have a huge effect on such people.  The closure of other companies has shown us that it is not just the people who work there who suffer; the larger community is also affected.  The larger economic sector of Arklow and its surroundings across the border into Wexford will suffer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">Arklow was a flagship town for many years as regards employment, but it has been left in the wilderness.  I am mindful of the fact that five years ago, IFI, a semi-State company, closed a unit in Arklow that traded profitably.  It was other parts of the IFI group that were not profitable.  The then Minister committed to paying all the creditors of the company.  To date, this has not happened.  A total of 22 pence in the pound has been paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">During a debate this morning on the Government's infrastructural spending, I heard it said that broadband is the new infrastructure.  Five years ago, we were the leading country in Europe in IT.  We are losing fast because we do not have the infrastructure and we will pay the price.  I call on the Government immediately to put in place an action plan for Arklow.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_490">
            <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
            <p eId="para_1023">I assume the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be interested in the news relating to Allergan as up to one third of the workforce live in north County Wexford, which is his constituency.  It is a huge blow to north Wexford, as well as south Wicklow.  My colleagues have spoken about the amount of work IDA Ireland has done in the Arklow area.  However, it has done nothing in Gorey and the rest of north Wexford.  There is a plot of land that has been left idle for many years and IDA Ireland does not equivocate about it.  It will not be built upon and there will be no jobs there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">Why is Allergan moving?  The answer, quite simply, is loss of competitiveness.  If one speaks to anybody working there, one discovers that according to senior management in Allergan, it costs in the region of $30 per hour to employ a person in Ireland.  In Costa Rica, where Allergan is moving, it costs in the region of $2 per hour.  That is a multiple of 15.  We face a huge problem in respect of our competitiveness in the future.  We simply will not be able to keep going.  Costs are spiralling, including local authority levies, rates, electricity prices and many other issues.  This is just one of many and there will be many more.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_1025">I thank the Deputies opposite for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The decision by Allergan to close its facility on a phased basis by mid-2009 with the loss of 360 jobs is very disappointing, particularly for the workers and families involved.  I understand that the company has entered into a consultation process with its employees and their trade unions on its proposal to close the site over an 18-month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">The Arklow plant, which produces breast implants for the global market, has been a very good employer in Arklow for a number of years and has received approximately €3.7 million in grant assistance from IDA Ireland since 1989.  The decision was taken as a result of an internal global business review and the company has decided to relocate the manufacture of all products produced in Arklow to its manufacturing facility in Costa Rica, which has spare capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">It is envisaged that employment at the Arklow site will be phased out primarily between December 2008 and the first six months of 2009.  However, I am pleased to say that the company in question remains strongly committed to its other Irish-based operations in Mayo and Dublin where several hundred people are employed.  While I am conscious of the effect that any job losses will have on the workers involved and their families, as well as on the local community, I assure people affected that the State agencies will give every support they can to assist the workers who will lose their jobs and to develop new employment opportunities in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The role of FÁS will be particularly important in assisting those people who will lose their jobs.  I understand that in response to a request from the company for assistance from FÁS, the agency will be arranging a meeting to discuss its full range of services.  This will include training and other supports.  The company has decided to phase out the operation over the timeframe set out in order to allow the employees to seek alternative employment.  In addition, the company has committed itself to finding suitable positions for workers in its other facilities, if this is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">I assure Deputies that IDA Ireland is in ongoing contact with the company and will continue to work very closely with its representatives during this challenging period.  In recent times, IDA Ireland has been meeting with the company in an effort to have it invest more heavily in technical process development and in significant process automation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">In its ongoing drive to attract investment opportunities to Arklow and County Wicklow generally, I am pleased to say that IDA Ireland is currently in negotiations with two investors with regard to relocating and expanding in IDA Ireland Arklow Business Park.  In addition, IDA Ireland has recently participated in a number of Wicklow enterprise days, which are aimed at promoting Wicklow as an attractive business location for Dublin companies.  I was very encouraged to learn, particularly in light of today's announcement, that Servier Ireland Industries Limited, which is based in Arklow, is actively recruiting at present and employment figures have consistently increased over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">The high-end medical technology sector in Ireland remains strong and will continue to be a focus for new investment, as witnessed by recent announcements in the sector.  I am confident that further investment announcements will be made in the sector in the near future.  According to the latest quarterly national household survey, published by the Central Statistics Office, the unemployment rate in the mid-east area, which includes Arklow, is 3.9%.  This is one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.  Hopefully, this will increase the chances of the 360 workers who will be laid off in seeking other forms of employment.  I assure Deputies that the Government, through the offices of the State agencies, will continue to promote Arklow and County Wicklow in general as attractive locations for employment and investment opportunities.  I sympathise with the workers and their families.  Obviously, it is a big loss to the area but I assure Deputies that the State agencies will do everything possible to find alternative forms of employment or assist in training.</p>

            <p eId="para_1032">I am grateful for the opportunity in the brief time available to me to address this matter with my colleagues.  The Minister is aware that a very significant case occurred yesterday, namely, the Ó Cuanacháin case in the High Court.  It is one of the great scandals of this Republic that the parents of autistic children still have to go through our courts as a means of getting justice for their children because the education system has failed them so disgracefully over a period of prolonged prosperity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The Minister's Department has a particular knack, aptitude and history of wrestling those parents seeking justice for their children through the courts system.  These parents are seeking to ensure that the very best standards of educational resources, be they through ABA or any other model, are there for their children.  It is important for the Minister to make her comments initially to the House on foot of the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">I am here for one reason only.  I want the Minister and the Government through her Department to be absolutely clear that if there are third party costs in this case, her Department will pay them in full.  In the submissions to the court, it is quite clear that the legal fees have been waived.  The Minister was correct when she said at 1 p.m. that this has been said through the senior counsel and others in the case.  However, there could be third party costs.  I am referring to stenographers, expert witnesses and the like.  I want to ensure that she will make it abundantly clear on the record tonight that her Department will meet the third party costs of this family, which has already gone through this ordeal over the past four and a half or five years with a case that lasted the guts of 70 days and which forced the father to leave work for a prolonged period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">The implications of this case are serious from a public policy perspective.  I argued that this case has effectively been a class action and could have implications for 150 potential cases that may come before the courts.  The implications of this case are real.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">This family has been let down.  The courts have already ruled in respect of the failure on the part of the HSE, namely, a lack of early intervention.  That has been made abundantly clear in the courts and liability has been given for the family.  The Minister has an obligation to tell the House tonight that she will underwrite any third party costs arising from this case.  I ask her to do so.</p>

The Ó Cuanacháins had a legitimate right to challenge the Department of Education and Science on that fact alone.  Before that, the courts had established that the State had denied Seán Ó Cuanacháin his right to an education and damaged his educational prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">ABA has the best effect at an early stage.  That this court case dragged on for four years, adding significantly to costs, is not the fault of the Ó Cuanacháin family, which sought early intervention.  They have lost that opportunity and to subject them to legal costs is ridiculous.</p>

This has been a terrible time for the Ó Cuanacháin family as it has sought a basic education for Seán.  The family is not unique — many are in a similar situation.  When we look back, this will be seen as one of the great scandals of our era.  At a time of unlimited resources over the past few years it is an outrageous situation.  The buck stops with the Minister and, no matter how she or the Department tries to dress this up, it is outrageous that a family must go to court to seek a basic education for a vulnerable child.  Nothing can excuse it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1044">As this case may be appealed to the Supreme Court, I am restricted in what I can say about it.  The Government recognises that parents of all children with special needs make great sacrifices and I am determined to ensure that all children get the support they need to reach their full potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">There is no doubt that, over decades, the record of the State in providing for children with special needs was very poor and that we are still playing catch up.  Significant advances have been made in recent years, improving the lives of children with special needs and their families.  There are now in the region of 17,000 adults in our mainstream schools working solely with children with special needs, compared to just a fraction of this a few years back.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">The procedures for accessing extra support have also been improved with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education.  Parents and teachers now have local special educational needs organisers on the ground to work with them and help them to get the appropriate support for their children.  This year €900 million will be invested in special education, an increase of 40% or €260 million on the 2006 amount.  Further improvements in services are on the way, with the roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the implementation of other commitments in the new programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">Regarding specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that, as each child with autism is unique, children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.  This view is informed by advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the inspectorate.  An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish task force on autism, supports this approach, while autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">The Department has supported the use of ABA for many years and training is provided for teachers.  However, based on research, advice and best practice, the Department does not accept that it should be the only method used.  While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.  It is important that children have access to a range of methods so that their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Hundreds of children with autism are integrated into mainstream schools and hundreds more are in autism-specific classes.  More than 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country, while more are being set up all the time.  A testament to the scale of progress being made in this area is the fact that over 100 of these classes have been established in the past year alone.  There are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants.  Extra assistants are provided where the children need them and a child can have his or her own special needs assistant if needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA.  The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.  Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">The issue of contention in the case referred to by the Deputies was whether my Department's special class model is appropriate or whether ABA should be the only method used in some settings.  Mr. Justice Peart, having listened to extensive expert evidence from both sides, decided that the special class model was indeed appropriate.  In his judgment on the costs issue yesterday, the judge drew attention to the fact that the State was not seeking to recover its own very substantial costs.  Justice Peart decided that the "fair and just" thing was not to make any order for costs, leaving each side to meet its own costs.  It should be noted that counsel for the family had previously indicated to the court that the burden of the costs would not bear upon the family and I hope that it holds true.</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">The judge also stated: "In my view there is no special cause in this case which would require this court to exercise its discretion to award to the plaintiffs the cost of the entire proceedings on the basis that it was a case of general importance to the country at large or that it raised matters of particular public importance."  He recognised that the case was of course of major importance to the plaintiff but he also pointed out that the plaintiff's parents had denied in their evidence that these proceedings were other than a claim in respect of their own son and stated that it was not part of any wider campaign in the public interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_1058">It is the right of individuals to proceed with litigation if they so wish. In these circumstances, where the Department of Education and Science believes that the education provision available is appropriate it will defend a case.  I consider that this is an entirely reasonable approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The number of cases taken against the State has shown a downward trend in recent times which can be partly attributable to the substantial improvements that have been made in services for children with special needs.  The Government is committed to expanding the services for all children with special education needs and for all children with autism in particular.  Where cases are taken, with every effort having been made to resolve cases and not having initiated the litigation, it is not reasonable to expect the State to take responsibility for the costs arising from the arrangements between any plaintiff and the plaintiff's legal team.  Indeed, in the small number of cases that have gone to full hearing, in all of which the State's position was upheld, the State has not sought its costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">My Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only method used in some settings.  We have been working hard to ensure that all children with autism have access to a range of approaches in special classes.  A network of more than 275 such classes is now in place.  A number of years ago, before this extensive network was in place, 12 centres were approved for funding under an ABA pilot programme.  The Government is committed to long-term funding for these 12 pilot programmes, subject to agreement on certain standards such as appropriate qualifications for staff and the type of educational programme available to the children.  Discussions have taken place with Irish Autism Action with a view to advancing this commitment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">Other centres seek funding under the pilot scheme.  However, now that a national network of special classes is available, no new centres will be brought into the pilot programme.  We are determined instead to ensure that each child has access to the autism-specific education programme that is now being made available to schools throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1063">As I have indicated in previous responses, the Programme for Government is a five year programme in which a number of guiding principles in relation to economic and budgetary matters have been set out.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">In October 2007 I published the Pre-Budget Outlook which set out the cost of providing for the existing level of services over the medium term. As the Deputy is aware, the first instalment of the delivery of the Programme for Government — Budget 2008 — was published in December. Budget 2008 announced all new spending and taxation measures in a single, unified way and was a significant reform providing for greater transparency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">Budget 2008 also sets out the latest budgetary and economic assessment for the coming three years with forecast General Government deficits of -0.9 per cent of GDP in 2008, -1.1 per cent of GDP in 2009 and -1.0 per cent of GDP in 2010. This fiscal position is predicated on a somewhat weaker economic outlook than was generally anticipated at the time the Programme for Government was agreed in the summer of 2007.</p>

        <b>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         if he has assessed the level of home repossessions which are occurring; and if there are implication for public policy. 
        [2145/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_507">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1069">The Deputy will appreciate that reports of a higher level of court proceedings for property repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the fact that not all of the proceedings relate to residential property. It should also be noted that even where the orders are secured some are not enforced. The number of orders granted by the High Court are a very small proportion — representing less than 0.2% — of the number of new mortgages issued in the same year. As such care needs to be exercised in drawing any particular conclusions regarding the property market or public policy overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">In this context, the Financial Stability Report 2007 published last November by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) points out that there are no firm indications of a significantly higher level of mortgage arrears in the banking system. The report notes that although the rate of non-performing assets on mortgage credit has picked up slightly over the last year or so, this increase has occurred from historical lows over recent years and the level remains relatively low in overall terms.  This trend also seems to be reflected in statistics on re-possessions made available by the Courts Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">In overall terms, housing affordability in Ireland is supported by relatively low loan-to-value ratios, income growth, interest rates that are relatively low in historic terms and increases in mortgage interest relief available in particular to first-time buyers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders. I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires financial service providers to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the Code sets out the requirement that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that they must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears. In addition, from 1 January 2007 staff providing advice or selling mortgage loans must meet minimum competency requirements, laid down by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">As the Deputy will be aware, Section 19 of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2007 introduced a system of regulation of non-deposit taking lenders including specialist or so-called sub-prime lenders with a view to extending the Consumer Protection Code to their activities. This system is currently being rolled out by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">As Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate advice without delay.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt, or in danger of getting into debt.  MABS offices, throughout the country, work with people in order to assist them with their financial planning and budgeting for the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1078">Persons arriving in Ireland from another country may be liable to pay duties and tax on goods purchased abroad.  The amount, if any, of duty and tax to be paid depends on whether:</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The goods were purchased in an EU Member State or in a country outside the EU — a third country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The goods are for personal or commercial use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">In the case of alcohol and tobacco products, Revenue have set indicative quantities of these products which, if not exceeded, will be regarded as for personal use, provided there is no indication or suspicion of commerciality.  If these quantities are exceeded, the passenger must prove that the goods are for personal use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">There are separate limits on the amount of tobacco products that can be brought into Ireland for personal use which have been purchased in certain EU countries.  Accordingly, it is important to note that depending on the circumstances, substantial quantities of alcohol and cigarettes may be brought into Ireland completely legally and without incurring any tax or duty liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Goods imported for commercial purposes are liable to customs duty (if imported from outside the EU), excise duty (depending on the type of goods) and VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">In this context, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners (who are responsible for Customs controls at all airports in the State, including the smaller regional airports) that checks are carried out on the basis of the risks involved; and that the risk criteria are subject to continuous review. There are 14 airports in the State licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority for public use, including Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Techniques and methodologies used by Customs in combating smuggling reflect international best practice by maximising the use of intelligence and risk profiling in order to target resources on areas of most risk. Equipment and resources used, including x-ray scanning and detector dogs, form part of the overall strategy. In addition, cognisance is taken of the latest international smuggling trends, patterns and methods; and individual routes are regularly risk tested.  Flights with origins and destinations carrying a high-risk rating attract particular attention.  It is important to note that the vast majority of air traffic to the smaller airports is intra-Community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">A full-time, year-round presence is maintained at Dublin airport on account of its volume of air traffic and passengers, while at Cork and Shannon, there is a reduced presence based on times of flights. Checks and attendance at other smaller airports are based on flight patterns and volume and mobile enforcement officers carry out controls there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Smuggling of alcohol by air has not been identified as a significant risk for a number of reasons, including weight and the security restrictions on carrying liquids. However, the potential for smuggling tobacco products constitutes a considerable revenue threat, in particular cigarettes sourced in some of the new accession states of the European Union, where excise duty rates are particularly low.   The threat posed to the Exchequer from organised cigarette smuggling from these States is significant and resources are specifically targeted at this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The enforcement environment for Customs has been largely shaped by the introduction of the Internal Market and the principles of freedom of movement.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of random checks on intra-Community goods and passengers. Intervention in the movement of Intra-Community traffic requires a reasonable suspicion that restricted or prohibited goods are being carried; and this places increased enforcement emphasis and reliance on already proven intelligence and profiling techniques.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The Revenue Commissioners advise me that, while the effectiveness of their anti-smuggling controls is subject to ongoing evaluation and review, they are satisfied that the existing individual risk assessment and deployment of personnel and resources at the State's airports constitute an effective deterrent to the smuggling of fiscal and prohibited goods.</p>

            <p eId="para_1103">As regards inquiry officers, again I have informed the House previously that I have no plans to amend the law to enable the Standards Commission to appoint an inquiry officer without having received a complaint. It is reasonable that a complaint to the Standards Commission should be required to commence the inquiry process, which, in itself, can carry serious consequences for the person who is to be the subject of it.  Numerous categories of persons, including members of the public and any public representative, are entitled to make a complaint against the persons and office holders against whom complaints can be made to the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">As regards the other changes to the Ethics legislation proposed by the Standards Commission in its last Annual Report, I do not propose to amend the definition of the term "specified act" used in the legislation, or to legislate for a complaint concerning failure to abide by certain defined ethical standards.  The existing definition of "specified act" aims to strike a fair balance, and there are already Codes of Conduct to guide the ethical behaviour of Oireachtas members, office-holders and civil servants in their day-to-day business and these codes can be taken into account by the Standards Commission in an investigation of an alleged breach of the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The other Standards Commission recommendations are technical.  One of them — about the furnishing of "nil" statements — is already provided for in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 and I aim to circulate amendments to cater for the remainder of them in advance of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill when it is being taken in the House.  My intention, assuming agreement among the Whips, is that the Bill should be taken in the current session.</p>

            <p eId="para_1111">Public service pay must develop in a manner that is consistent with competitiveness, price stability and budgetary policy. Government policy on public service pay is that the public service should be in a position to attract and retain its fair share of good quality staff at all levels. It should neither lead the market nor trail it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The current public service pay agreement under Towards 2016 expires in September 2008 and talks on a new agreement are due to commence soon. Towards 2016 provides that implementation of the Public Service Benchmarking Report will be discussed by the parties in the context of discussions on whatever arrangements on pay and conditions are to be put in place on the expiry of the current public service pay agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">Benchmarking has been accepted, by both the employers and unions, as a significant improvement on the old pay determination system which was based on relativities whereby if one grade or group of public sector workers received an increase it led to leapfrogging and catch up claims right across the public service. Experience over the years particularly during the 1990s showed that the demands for pay increases by reference to ‘relativities' were not sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">The Benchmarking Body has produced a report in accordance with its terms of reference.  It is agreed between Government and the trade unions that the best approach to ensuring that individual public service grades are paid appropriately, is to compare all aspects of public sector jobs with their private sector equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">While the current benchmarking exercise may yield little for most public servants, they have benefited significantly in recent years from the first benchmarking exercise and the general round increases under successive national agreements. The framework now in place of assurances of regular benchmarking reviews of public service pay against the market, conditionality of pay increases on the basis of co-operation with change and industrial relations stability, and verification mechanisms is a balanced and sensible approach to the management of public service pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">In more difficult international economic conditions, maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of our economy is critical particularly for a small open economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">The level of annual pay increases has moved up from around 3% under the earlier national partnership deals to just over 6% in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and still over 4% under Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016.  This is well ahead of pay developments in our main trading partners. This is not sustainable in the long term and particularly not in more adverse economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">Pay settlements must reflect the economic fundamentals. With strong economic growth and productivity increasing strongly, as we experienced over the last decade, there was scope for greater flexibility in the level of pay increases. Pay developments in the period immediately ahead must reflect the more challenging economic and competitiveness scenario that we now face and be more directly linked to changes in productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">In recent years Ireland's competitiveness has disimproved. We need to halt and reverse this trend.  Containing costs and improving productivity is critical for the private sector, particularly in more difficult economic circumstances. The same is true of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">Public service pay levels can only increase at a rate that is consistent with budgetary discipline and national competitiveness. In addition the productivity and efficiency of the public service needs to be improved on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1122">The proposals published by the Commission begin the process which will lead to an agreement on the contributions of individual Member States towards meeting the EU targets agreed at the 2007 Spring Council. The Commission's proposals require Ireland to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, based on 2005 emissions figures, and achieve an overall target of 16% of final energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">The proposals set out by the Commission are complex and far reaching. They require detailed analysis and discussion at EU and domestic level and my Department will be central to this process. The cost in budgetary terms and the economic impact will depend on the methods used to achieve whatever target is finally set. Obviously, we will try to be as fiscally neutral as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">The Government fully supports the objectives agreed at the Spring Council last year and the leadership shown by the EU's ambitions in this area of climate change. In that context it is important that national circumstances and competitiveness impacts are considered. In this regard, it is essential to ensure that the Commission's proposals adequately take into account the Irish situation in relation to the large difference between our Gross Domestic Product and Gross National Income, our infrastructural deficit, our recent and projected levels of population growth, and the relatively large size of Irish agriculture and its global competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">It is important however, that we look positively on the challenge and not just dwell on the negatives. To the extent, for example, that extra capital spending generates fuel and other efficiencies in using natural resources this will be to our overall economic and fiscal benefit. The proposals for the Emissions Trading Scheme also involves new revenue streams for national Governments which will also form part of the policy mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">As I said in my Budget Speech this is a challenge for all citizens not just the Government and will involve choices being made and changes in behaviour to realise the ambition of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">The Government has been acting over recent years to begin to address the challenge of climate change and we will continue to work towards reducing emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">As Deputy O'Dowd is aware, there are two forms of accounting in the public service. The accounts of Government Departments and Offices are prepared on a cash basis while Local Authorities and Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, for example, prepare their accounts on an accrual basis which includes the charging of depreciation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">As the Deputy is aware, the Appropriation Accounts for central Government Departments and Offices are required under legislation to be prepared on a cash basis. In a cash accounting environment, the value of a capital resource is recognised and charged fully to the account in the year of acquisition. In addition, in cash-based accounts, the planning for the cost of replacement of capital items is done on a requirements basis and submitted for Vote approval. It should be noted that cash accounting does not provide the scope to build up a fund of money for depreciation for future spends either current or capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Under the Management Information Framework (MIF) Project new accruals-based accounting systems were rolled out across the civil service over the last four years.  It is now possible for all Departments and Offices to capture more detailed information for the better management of spending programmes and to improve the scope of financial reporting.  Drawing on the information available under the MIF, an information note (Note 3) in the Appropriation Account reports on the capital assets position and presents the position of Net Assets (original cost less accumulated depreciation).  In addition, all Departments and Offices must now present an Annual Output Statement to Dáil Éireann which sets out the target outputs of Departments and Agencies for the resources provided and report progress on performance as compared with target the following year.  These initiatives significantly improve the efficiency of resource use in Departments and offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1135">The Deputy will recall that projections of future pension liabilities were published in the Government's Green Paper on Pensions last October. These indicate that the cost of Social Welfare pension provision will increase from around 3½% of GDP to over 10% by 2050. This primarily follows from the ageing of our population.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) was established under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 with the objective of pre-funding in part the future Exchequer cost of Social Welfare and Public Service pensions. The legislation requires that 1% of GNP be paid every year from the Exchequer into the Fund until at least 2055. The amount being paid into the Fund this year is just under 1690 million euro. The estimated value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, as published with the National Treasury Management Agency's Preliminary Results for the year 2007, was 21.3 billion euro at 26 December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">As the Deputy will appreciate, it was never the intention that the Fund would cover the full cost of Social Welfare and Public Service pensions. As envisaged from the outset, the assets accumulated in the NPRF will go some way towards easing future funding concerns, but will fall short of projected pension liabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">A range of measures that could help address the challenges we face in meeting pension commitments are discussed in the Green Paper. The consultation process currently under way provides an opportunity to consider these in detail.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">I might add that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 provides that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission shall commission, from time to time, assessments of the projected profile of Exchequer outlays on Social Welfare and Public Service pensions, after consultation with the relevant Ministers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1143">The collection and recovery of tax and the specific circumstances in which tax may be the subject of write off is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by Revenue that its primary focus and priority is the collection of tax. Inevitably, however, cases do arise where, because of the particular circumstances, collection of the tax is not possible or the tax cannot be collected without disproportionate cost to Revenue. In these circumstances arrangements are made to pass the tax as irrecoverable. This is a step that is not lightly taken and each case is subject to review in accordance with strict guidelines before the decision is taken to write off the tax debt.  Furthermore the process is then subject to audit each year both by Revenue's own Internal Audit Unit and by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

            <p eId="para_1165">In 2006 a total of €120m was deemed to be uncollectible and written off by Revenue. At 0.19% of gross receipts, this was the lowest ratio of write off to gross receipts over the period 2002-2006.  This includes both personal and business taxes and PRSI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">In relation to businesses, the grounds for write off can include liquidation, receivership and examinership, which are formal legal processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they seek to maximise collection and that write offs are very carefully monitored. Strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve debt reduction mainly through collection and recovery are the subject of annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process. Two significant areas of focus by Revenue are maximising the timeliness of voluntary compliance and reducing the level of accumulated debt. Revenue's performance on both these fronts in recent years has been very effective. In addition, the new Revenue Statement of Strategy 2008-2010 that will be finalised very shortly will set out the broad direction and focus of Revenue with regard to debt management for the next three years and seek to build on the very good progress in debt reduction that has been achieved in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1173">The Comptroller and Auditor General is a constitutional officer who is independent in the exercise of his statutory functions, including those in relation to value for money examinations. He decides on the work to be carried out by his Office and the manner in which it is carried out. In doing so, he is not required to consult my Department. Consequently, I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to express a view on those matters. Likewise, it would be inappropriate for me to speculate about what conclusions he might reach in the course of an examination. I am aware that the C&amp;AG is undertaking a value for money examination of the impact of the Management Information Framework. As with any examination that the C&amp;AG undertakes, my Department will cooperate with his Office to ensure that the examination is completed in a timely and efficient manner. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Deputy will be aware that Standing Order 158 (8) of this House provides for the Committee to make such suggestions to the C&amp;AG regarding his work as it sees fit. The Deputy may consider raising the issue through that channel if she wishes to find out more about this particular examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">The Management Information Framework was under the "Delivering Better Government" initiative. The Deputy may wish to note that the project was completed slightly below the estimate of €60 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">As regards controlling expenditure on projects, I would point out that a number of measures have been taken to help in that regard, including the revised Capital Appraisal Guidelines of February 2005 and the Value for Money Circular of 26th January 2006 which apply to all capital expenditure. The responsibility for the management of each project and for ensuring Value for Money rests with the individual Department and Agency in the first instance and each must appoint a project manager for all major capital projects. The project manager is required to report to senior management or the Management Advisory Committee as appropriate at regular intervals on progress versus the contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_1177">The Government is not in a position to quantify the carbon impact of all tax and expenditure. I would point out to the Deputy that the Government's expenditure this year alone will be in excess of €50 billion.

            <p eId="para_1184">On the question of under-claiming by tenants of rent relief, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have taken a number of initiatives to encourage taxpayers to claim their full entitlements.  These include measures to increase awareness generally of the range of credits available.  Extensive advertising took place in 2006 and 2007 covering the most common tax credits, which specifically included rent relief.  There was also a targeted advertising campaign in Autumn 2007 to encourage the uptake of rent relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Revenue are including an information leaflet with the 2008 Tax Credit Certificates, which are currently being issued to some 2.2 million PAYE taxpayers.  This leaflet gives information on the most common credits available, including rent relief, and encourages the making of claims where due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">In relation to under-returning of rental income by landlords, all taxpayers, including landlords, are obliged to make accurate returns under the self-assessment system and are liable to Revenue audit in the normal way.  I am assured by Revenue that the audit of landlords is an ongoing aspect of their work.  For example, in 2006, the latest year for which full data are available, audits were concluded in 527 cases where rental income was the main source of income returned. The yield from these cases was €4.7 million in tax, interest and penalties.  Cases where rental income is a secondary source are, of course, also included in Revenue audit programmes.  Cases are selected for audit on the basis of perceived risk including, in the case of landlords, consideration of information from tenants or third parties where this has been successfully matched.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that this risk-based audit approach, combined with information matching wherever possible, is the appropriate strategy for tackling under-reporting of income by landlords.</p>

         if, in view of the fact that the Revenue Commissioners brought in €2.4 billion from special investigations since 2002 and the endemic nature of the problem, he will review or increase the penalties, including the increased use of incarceration as a deterrent, for tax evaders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1189">As the Deputy is aware, the special investigations to which he refers relate to major projects undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners in connection with particular methodologies used by taxpayers to evade tax in the past. These investigation projects have proved to be very successful and some are nearing finality. The recoveries made to date comprise tax, interest and civil penalties. The Commissioners also expect a longer term compliance dividend as a consequence of the success of these projects.  The penalties arising from the projects, which are imposed under the Taxes Acts for fraudulently or negligently delivering incorrect returns, are substantial and can amount to one hundred percent of the tax defaulted. The Revenue Commissioners may mitigate the penalty where a voluntary disclosure is made and full co-operation is extended. The Code of Practice for Revenue Auditors outlines the approach adopted in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">I am satisfied that the level of penalties provided for by the Taxes Acts is sufficient and provides a strong deterrence to tax evasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">The issue of incarceration arises on sentencing, where a taxpayer who has been the subject of a criminal investigation by Revenue is convicted in the Criminal Courts.  In recent years Revenue has significantly ratcheted up its programme of investigating particular cases with a view of prosecution and has a good record in achieving convictions.  Although the Taxes Acts provide that a jail sentence can be imposed for serious tax offences, it is ultimately a matter for the Judiciary who, I understand, take account of a range of factors in determining the nature of the sentence handed down.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">That commitment is protected, in an EU context, by the principle of unanimity in taxation matters. The draft Reform Treaty confirms that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">I would note that although various technical work has been taking place, the Commission has not yet made any formal proposal in relation to the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB) proposition, and I would hope that the Commission will reflect on the considerable scepticism and opposition to the proposition among member states before deciding whether to make any such proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">It is important also to remember that there have been no political decisions taken on the CCCTB at the level of the Council of Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">Considering that the Commission has not yet brought forward a proposal it is very difficult for us or any other member state to estimate its impact with any precision. However, it seems very likely that if, theoretically, such a system were to be introduced, it could give rise to considerable disruption of foreign direct investment activities, could create a disincentive for the location of such investment within the EU, could reduce the ability of Governments, especially in smaller and faster developing member states, to manage their own fiscal affairs, and would be divisive in Europe.</p>

            <p eId="para_1228">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.

The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must withdraw the existing excise reliefs. The Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007.

            <p eId="para_1233">The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to condoms. Under EU VAT law, it is not possible to introduce new zero rates of VAT, as we can only retain the zero rating that was in existence on 1 January 1991.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1246">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 121, 146, 149 and 263 to 265, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">A progress report by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) was submitted to me and published on 8th October last. The Group reported that implementation of the civil service element of the Decentralisation Programme is progressing satisfactorily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Over eleven thousand civil and public servants have applied to relocate under the Programme. Of these, over 6,000 or 55% are currently based in Dublin. The Central Applications Facility (CAF) remains open and continues to receive applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">At the end of 2007, decentralising organisations had a presence in 33 towns.  Approximately four thousand staff had been assigned to decentralising posts and over 2,000 of these are currently in their new locations, while the remainder are being trained in advance of decentralisation to a new location, as soon as accommodation becomes available.  Taking account of both posts moved and assignments, 48% of the civil service general service posts have already moved or have staff in place with a commitment to move.  The comparable figure for the civil service professional &amp; technical staff is 24% and for State Agency posts is 26%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">From the announcement of the Programme in December 2003, the focus has been on detailed planning and organisation of the property, staffing and business aspects.  The DIG has considered it essential that all organisations take the necessary time to prepare this groundwork well in order to ensure effective implementation of a programme of this scale and complexity. In short, its focus has not been on how speedily the programme can be achieved but how well. It is important to remember that the programme is not just about moving public services. It fundamentally impacts on the staff in those organisations, on their career choices and their expectations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Property or sites have been acquired or are well advanced in a total of 38 locations.  In addition, the OPW have been very efficient in securing suitable advance or temporary accommodation in over 20 locations to facilitate early phasing of business units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The October DIG report provides an update of the OPW timeframes for the expected completion of permanent accommodation. The OPW conducts a review of the property timeframes for permanent accommodation on an ongoing basis and is keeping these timeframes under review based on its experience to date in relation to property selection and acquisition, brief and design issues, tendering periods, planning issues and contractual arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">I remain confident that the public service will deliver this programme in a considered, sensible and sensitive manner. The Government is anxious to ensure that the momentum of the programme is maintained and developed and in that context Secretaries General of decentralising Departments have been asked to review these timeframes in association with the OPW and the DIG to assess where earlier progress could be made either in relation to permanent accommodation or advance accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">There are, however, a number of challenges remaining, which have been identified by the DIG in its latest report. My Department and the wider management of the public service will continue to work closely with staff representatives to seek appropriate solutions to address the concerns of the professional &amp; technical staff in the civil service and those employed in state agencies, while also ensuring the delivery of the Government programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">With regard to the State Agencies, the DIG has noted, in its most recent report that the pace of progress in relation to the State Agency part of the programme continues to be slow.  It expects that all Agencies should now, at a minimum, have initiated HR recruitment policies to support the programme, have begun to put phased timeframes in place and be actively securing advance and/or permanent accommodation solutions in the decentralised location. It also continues to emphasise the central role of the Board and management in each Agency in driving forward the implementation of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">The Government has always recognised that the State Agency aspect of the programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service but is determined to make progress towards the objective of moving all the State Agency posts as announced in December 2003. I anticipate considerable progress on this element of the programme over the lifetime of this Government.  With a view to advancing this aspect of the programme, the DIG is currently engaging in a round of meetings with each Agency's CEO and the Secretary General of the parent Department in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The Labour Court recommendation in relation to the dispute between FÁS and SIPTU provides a renewed opportunity for both unions and management to address the relevant issues.  My Department has been in contact with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish how progress can be made on this aspect of the Labour Court recommendation and I remain confident that through dialogue and negotiation, progress can be advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">The estimated gross cost of the property aspects of the original decentralisation programme was €900m at the outset of the programme (2004 prices).  This was based on provision of accommodation for 10,300 staff outside of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The overall number of staff for which accommodation is required has increased since the announcement of the programme due to additional bodies and locations being added to the programme, changes to business functions of certain organisations, additional space required for work-sharing staff, planned future expansion etc. and consolidation of certain existing regional offices into new buildings.  Based on the costs incurred to date, the OPW anticipates that the direct cost of providing accommodation for this increased number of staff will be contained within the overall envelope.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">While the majority of posts have not yet moved from Dublin, the OPW has been able to dispose of property in Dublin being held for future needs because the announcement of the decentralisation programme clarified that most future expansion of Civil Service accommodation would not be in central Dublin.  Total income from such property disposed of between January 2004 and December 2007 was €387.5m.  In addition property valued at €75 million was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.  In addition OPW has agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of circa €125m up to the end of 2007 and further ongoing large property disposals are planned having regard to progress with staff moves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">As expected, non-property costs have been increasing since the beginning of 2007 as more advance accommodation is in place, staff training has increased and actual moves have taken place.  At end June 2007, the total non-property costs incurred amount to approximately €9m. This reflects the significant rate of progress across decentralising organisations this year in furthering their implementation arrangements. Figures for the remainder of the year are being collated at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1263">Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, averaged 4.9 per cent in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Of this 4.9 per cent, 2.2 per cent was contributed by increased mortgage interest repayments. Including the impact of mortgage rate increases in the CPI not only masks the underlying inflation rate but also highlights the short-term impact of interest rate increases which are designed to bring down inflation. A better measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index is the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which excludes, among other things, mortgage interest. The HICP is also the measure used by the EU and ECB to compare inflation across member states. The average increase in the HICP in 2007 was 2.8 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">My Department's inflation forecast for 2008 is for CPI inflation to average 3.0 per cent and  for HICP inflation to average 2.4 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">I have continued in successive Budgets to increase the rates of social welfare payments significantly and to make improvements in the living standards of average workers. Having regard to general round increases under the pay elements of the last two partnership agreements, and to Budget changes in the areas of tax, child benefit and the early childcare supplement (where appropriate), income earners have seen significant real growth in their take home pay since 2003. Also, in Budget 2008 I have, yet again, ensured that the income of the average worker is kept well outside liability to the higher rate of tax, and those on the minimum wage remain outside the tax net.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">The best way to protect the real incomes of ordinary workers is to pursue policies that sustain competitiveness and employment. Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. We must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. Seeking to maintain low inflation, the pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are essential. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">A moderate rate of inflation is a key priority of economic policy because of its importance for competitiveness. Pursuing responsible fiscal and pay policies is important in that context.</p>

To date, no staff have been decentralised by the Public Appointments Service, or the Valuation Office.  However ten (10) staff in the PAS and eleven (11) staff in the Valuation Office are currently in posts in Dublin awaiting a transfer to Youghal.  PAS and the Valuation Office are due to relocate to Youghal in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1275">In response to a Parliamentary Question on 2 October 2007, I provided information setting out the position where public servants are considering the purchase of additional notional service.  In such situations it is important to note that there is no specific need to contact a financial advisor as the purchase of additional notional service, in circumstances where the facility is available, can be arranged directly with the relevant Personnel Section. If in doubt about the matter, independent advice could be sought by the officer. My reply on 2 October 2007 also noted that detailed advice on this matter was available on the Government's website at www.cspensions.gov.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Although the Deputy's question specifically relates to the purchase of notional service by public servants, there may be an issue as to whether the type of legislative change sought by the Deputy might be appropriate in relation to the purchase of Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) by public servants. Any such change would require consultation with the Financial Regulator, in view of its statutory consumer protection mandate, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, given his policy and legislative responsibilities in the area of pensions provision. I have asked my Department to write to the Financial Regulator and to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this matter to request their views.  I will keep the Deputy informed of progress.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1278">The Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), established in April 2005 to deal with consumer complaints about financial service providers, has made a very significant contribution to protecting and promoting the interests of consumers of financial services. Where a complaint is upheld the Financial Services Ombudsman can direct the financial service provider to pay compensation to the complainant for any loss, expense or inconvenience sustained by the complainant and can also issue directions to the financial services provider concerned to change a practice relating to its conduct. Since its inception in April 2005 to end December 2007 the Financial Services Ombudsman has received 11,550 complaints and has concluded 10,700, 59% of which were settled in the complainants favour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The role and functions of the FSO in dealing with consumer complaints strongly complements that of the Financial Regulator in protecting the interests of consumers of financial services as a whole. During the passage of the FSO legislation through the Oireachtas in 2004 it was stated, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, that the Ombudsman's remit essentially is to deal with individual complaints from customers of financial institutions and it is the responsibility of the Consumer Director in the Financial Regulator to deal with general issues relating to the protection of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The relevant legislation provides for co-operation between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on general issues relating to the protection of consumers. A Memorandum of Understanding has been concluded between the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator to ensure the efficient and effective handling of complaints.  An issue drawing attention to a general breach affecting consumers can be referred by the Financial Services Ombudsman to the Financial Regulator. Such issues can then be examined by the Financial Regulator to consider if there are any suspected breaches of the relevant regulatory requirements including the Consumer Protection Code. The Financial Regulator can, as part of its administrative sanctions regime, seek to mediate or take regulatory action in relation to a firm including an order to make refunds to a firm's customers where appropriate. Last November I advised the Deputy that I would ask the FSO and the Financial Regulator to review their current co-operation arrangement to ensure that these work smoothly where a finding of the FSO in an individual case may have implications for a broader group of customers of a financial services firm. I am informed that the Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator met on Monday, 21 January 2008 and have reviewed their current co-operation arrangements as requested. They have indicated that the present arrangement is working satisfactorily and that they are preparing a joint submission in response to my request.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The Deputy will be aware that a recent High Court judgement confirmed that the Financial Services Ombudsman's power of direction, except in relation to a change in general practice, may only relate to an individual claimant and does not extend to payment of compensation for other consumers in relation to similar conduct of the financial service provider. The implications of the recent High Court decision will be referred by my Department to the Advisory Forum on Financial Legislation which has recently commenced its work. Submissions of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Financial Regulator on this matter will be brought to the Advisory Forum.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">My Department has been informed by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI) that the level of deposits, owned by Irish residents, amounts to approximately €178 billion.  This is an aggregate figure based on the Central Bank Monthly Statistics up to the end of November 2007.  As regards the number of deposits, the CBFSAI surveys banks and financial institutions on a number of items including the number of deposits.  The results of the 2007 survey (based on 2006 information) conducted by the CBFSAI indicates that there were approximately 8 million deposits owned by Irish residents.  The Registrar of Credit Unions has also advised my Department that 2.85m credit union members held €12.4 billion of savings in Irish credit unions as of 30 June 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">As far as the disaggregated data is concerned, as this has not been collected by the CBFSAI or the Registrar of Credit Unions as a matter of routine, the information requested by the Deputy is not available at the present time.

            <p eId="para_1291">While the choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with the individual customer and the lending institution concerned, as Minister for Finance, I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">Under the legislative framework for the regulation of financial services, the Financial Regulator has a statutory mandate to safeguard the interests of consumers.  Under its Consumer Protection Code, the Financial Regulator has introduced a broad range of consumer protection measures relating to the sale of financial products, including mortgages. These measures include suitability tests, know your customer fact finding and the provision of sufficient information to customers. In addition, from 1 January 2007 staff providing advice or selling mortgage loans must meet minimum competency requirements laid down by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The Financial Regulator publishes a guide called "Mortgages made Easy" available on its website or from its Consumer Information Office which stresses all the issues that need to be taken into consideration by consumers when deciding on the type of mortgage which suits their personal circumstances best.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The information being made available by the Financial Regulator, together with statutory information and warnings in the case of mortgages under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 serve as an adequate basis for consumers to make a decision about the type of mortgage which best suits their financial needs.  It is obviously important in making such decisions that both prospective borrowers and lenders are highly cognisant of the prospect of changes in economic and financial conditions particularly over the long time horizon applicable to a mortgage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">In terms of both prudential supervision and safeguarding the interests of consumers, I would like to reiterate the point the Financial Regulator has made many times before that there is a clear onus on the boards and management of individual institutions to ensure that they maintain prudent lending standards. The Financial Regulator continues to scrutinise banks' lending policies as part of its ongoing supervisory activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">Finally, in assessing the statistics referred to by the Deputy it is important to make the point that the data published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government refers to new loans approved by credit institutions and, therefore, it does not capture changes to these loans such as when the borrower commences to repay capital, whether on a regular or once-off basis.</p>

At the same time employment is forecast to continue to show net gains of some 24,000 or a 1.1 per cent increase. However, this is not expected to fully absorb the projected increase in the labour force, so that a modest rise in unemployment is expected. The Budget 2008 forecasts have not been revised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1381">I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 129 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established in 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">Under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission controls and manages the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The Commission has discretionary authority to determine the Fund's investment strategy in accordance with the Fund's statutory investment policy of securing the optimal total financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the Commission. This framework has given the Commission the freedom to develop, outside of the political process, a long-term investment strategy primarily based on a diversified portfolio of real assets.  Indeed, a long-term State fund with no need for liquidity and no requirement to match liabilities on a yearly basis has some clear advantages in seeking to maximise long-term investment returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">I am aware and I accept that the appropriate investment strategy for a long-term fund can lead to short-term volatility. In its 2006 Annual Report, the Commission states that its asset allocation strategy is founded on the premise that real assets, such as equities and property, whose performance is linked to the rate of economic growth, will continue, over the long term, to outperform financial assets such as bonds. It goes on to say that, while equities are inherently more volatile than bonds, with sharp performance swings over short time periods, the Fund's long-term investment horizon enables it to accept this volatility in a trade-off for the higher expected return.</p>

Of course the Report does no such thing.

            <p eId="para_1397">a range of on-line services and systems for farmers including single payments, area aid, animal tagging, etc.;</p>

            <p eId="para_1400">eCabinet supporting the business of Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">Additionally, my own Department has developed and implemented a shared service for online tendering, a shared system for human-resource management, a centralised eEstimates system, and shared voice and data communications infrastructure for the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">All of these projects have been successfully completed and have resulted in significant savings, improved processes and efficiencies, and in far more being done with less.  For example, the numbers of people in employment and thus with tax records has grown dramatically with no increases in Revenue staff; the changes in child benefit have allowed staff to be redeployed to other areas requiring attention; the shared communications approach has resulted in the region of €25million in savings per annum; the shared eTenders service was the first in Europe to facilitate automatic publishing of tendering opportunities at European level, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">Consequently, no objective observer could describe the story of eGovernment in Ireland as one of failure.  To do so would be to denigrate the valuable work of those who have delivered the excellent projects I've listed and many others.  It would be to set a standard for the public service that in Government ICT projects anything less than unequivocal and total success is failure; a standard that in reality no-one seeking to deliver any ICT project in the public or the private sector could accept.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">This is not to say that there haven't been some difficulties and challenges.  Some things did take longer than would have been hoped at the outset and some things did cost more than originally expected.  But in the main there are detailed and understandable reasons for these things happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">Looking forward, the provision and integration of full on-line services is extremely complex and care needs to be taken that we do this as cost effectively as possible.  We are making reasonable progress and the recent 2008 e-Government Readiness Index produced by the United Nations shows that Ireland is now part of a cluster of countries including countries generally considered progressive in eGovernment such as Austria, Finland, Germany and Singapore.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">It's worth remembering that we are dealing here with the novel, in terms of technology and organisational change.  There is no easy set of solutions.  I think it is clear that the larger Departments and Offices who have already made excellent progress will continue to do that as they have the necessary resources, experience and skills.  I think it is also clear that there must now be a greater focus on the small and medium sized public bodies to help them achieve more in terms of delivering on-line services.  The public service has already done considerable work in analysing how best to proceed from here.  Last year, the Government set up a review of Reach and the Public Services Broker.  That review is due in the near future.  Additionally, our colleagues in the OECD have been reviewing eGovernment in general as part of their review of the public service.  I am satisfied that the combination of recommendations from these reviews coupled with the internal analysis that is being done will help us to determine the most appropriate structures, governance and priorities to ensure the continuing success of our eGovernment programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1434">I wish to draw the Deputy's attention that on 6 December 2006, as part of Budget 2007, I announced that it was planned to introduce changes to the VRT system to take greater account of environmental issues, and in particular Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Programme for Government of June 2007 re-affirmed the commitment to introduce measures to further weight VRT in favour of cars with lower emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">A public consultation process was carried out by my Department. The consultation process evidenced broad support for a reorientation and rebalancing of VRT. I announced in my Budget Statement on 5 December 2007, my plans to introduce a revised VRT system, based on CO2 emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Changing the VRT system to make it take greater account of CO2 emissions levels is a significant change. It is therefore desirable that members of the public be given reasonable notice of any changes being introduced. In addition, the motor industry indicated that it needed at least six months prior notice of any substantial change being made to the system, in the light of the advance ordering arrangements for new cars in the industry.  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners' technical and administrative processes required amendment in order to facilitate the revised VRT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">Having examined the matter, it was considered therefore that any proposed VRT changes should be effective from around mid-2008; and the new system will be introduced, as announced, on 1 July 2008. I am satisfied that this lead-in period is both necessary and appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1446">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position in relation to travel tickets is that where an employer provides an employee with an annual or monthly bus or train pass, the cost of such a pass is not taxable. In addition, where an employee foregoes salary, and such salary foregone is used by the employee to purchase an annual or monthly bus or train pass, then the salary foregone is not taxable. Both of these instances are subject to certain conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that employees are not required to include in their tax returns income arising from the provision of travel passes by their employers. In the case of employers the expense of travel passes to employees is allowable as a deduction in arriving at profits for tax purposes. However, the employer's tax return of income does not contain an entry in respect of this item and the employer's profit and loss account does not normally distinguish between this particular expense and other employment-related expenses.  In these circumstances it is not possible to provide a totally reliable estimate of numbers of costs involved at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">The numbers of Travel Passes provided under the scheme have increased from 26,616 in 2002 to some 39,549 in 2005. In a previous Parliamentary Question, based on ticket sale receipt figures supplied by the main public transport providers, I estimated the cost in tax forgone in the years 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 as €4.4m, €6.6m, €7.7m and €9.7m respectively.  These figures assumed an average marginal tax rate of 30% plus the values of PRSI/Health levies forgone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">I do not have ticket sale receipt figures for 2006 and 2007 at this time.  The main public transport operators are being contacted in this regard and when this information is to hand I will forward it to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1451">I should explain that the Irish clearing system is a private institution, which operates under the general umbrella of the Irish Payment Services Organisation. I am informed that the clearing cycle for a cheque should in normal circumstances take no more than three business days, with the bar on returning a cheque unpaid being set at five business days.  This might occur where, say there are insufficient funds in the payer's bank account.  The clearing cycle may be quicker (in some cases instantaneous) if a cheque is both drawn on and collected on the same bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">There is also provision for special presentation of a cheque for immediate payment, which is only available in the Dublin area for cheques up to a value of €625,000 and where the payee presents the cheque before 3 p.m. in the nominated branch of the bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The timeframe is also dependent on the bank or financial institution being a member of the Irish Paper Clearing Company (IPCC) Ltd.  The Irish Paper Clearing Company Limited (IPCC) is responsible for the clearing and settlement of all paper payment instruments in Ireland and is overseen by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI).  Any bank or financial institution outside of this framework may have a longer cheque clearance cycle.  A list of members is available directly from IPSO at www.ipso.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">As to when any particular bank will permit a customer to draw against lodged cheques, this is an individual bank decision based on its own risk management and credit control arrangements.  I would expect that all banks would inform their customers of the relevant terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">By way of concluding, the Deputy should note that cheque usage in Ireland has stabilised at 130 million, which represents a decline in the overall proportion of cheques as a means of payment as use of electronic methods has increased noticeably.  As more efficient electronic payments systems become more popular, it can be expected that cheque usage will further decline in relative terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Modern commercial financial and retail transactions will increasingly be electronically based for reason of efficiency and security.  This will benefit not just businesses but also the ordinary person in the street.  I have contributed to the delivery of this desirable policy objective through the reduction of the stamp duty charge on financial cards in Budget 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1459">Including the impact of mortgage rate increases in the CPI not only masks the underlying inflation rate but also highlights the short-term impact of interest rate increases which are designed to bring down inflation. As such, a better measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index is the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which excludes, among other things, mortgage interest and is a more realistic measure of inflation. The average increase in the HICP in 2007 was 2.8 per cent, and the forecast increase for 2008 is 2.4 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">A moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance for competitiveness. Pursuing responsible fiscal and pay policies is important in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1500">It is important in comparing the number of consumer focused inspections carried out by the Financial Regulator in the years 2004 to 2006 as reported in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to take account of a number of special factors which are highly relevant to the comparison. These factors are, in fact, referred to in the C&amp;AG's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">These include the consideration that over 20 per cent of the 2004 inspections were preliminary visits to mortgage intermediaries carried out as a means of gathering information about the sector and lasting about an hour each. In 2005, 46 comprehensive inspections of mortgage intermediaries were carried out lasting for a minimum of one day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">In addition issues of concern identified during inspection visits carried out in 2004 required follow-up action by inspection teams.  This was particularly the case for larger and more complex financial service providers reducing the time available for new inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The Financial Regulator has also highlighted the important point that if the inspection rate is compared to the size of the current account and savings accounts markets, the retail credit institutions that were inspected by the Consumer directorate during 2004 and 2005 represented an estimated 65% of the combined current account and savings markets in Ireland in 2006.  Moreover, the Financial Regulator has inspected the top five insurance companies and the top five banks each year meaning that each year between 65-82 per cent of the insurance market was covered while between 67-95 per cent of the banking market was covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">The Financial Regulator's Strategic Plan 2008-2010 which was submitted to me last September and which was also laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas sets out the Financial Regulator's plans to monitor and enforce compliance with the Consumer Protection Code through themed inspections and mystery shopping exercises in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">Finally, it is important to stress that consumer-focused inspections are only one of the methods employed by the Financial Regulator to ensure that regulated entities are compliant with regulatory requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1507">The change in the public finances in 2007 compared with 2006 reflected firstly a significant increase in Government outlays across all public services and secondly a more moderate change in overall tax receipts reflecting the adjustment in economic conditions as the housing market commenced a return to more normal market conditions. The public finances are sound with a General Government surplus recorded in 2007 while a moderate deficit is envisaged this year. The General Government debt level is one of the lowest in the euro area.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_558">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1519">The Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) has since 1989, operated a savings protection scheme (SPS) for credit unions. The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by ensuring that credit unions are financially and administratively sound and provides for savings protection for each individual credit union member.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">ILCU have stated publicly that the savings protection scheme is open to all credit unions. It is important to note that under the SPS regime no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares and deposits and no credit union has become insolvent. The SPS has only been called upon in a very limited number of cases and it has never been necessary to make savings protection payments to individual credit union members. It is also important to note that sound prudential supervision by the Registrar of Credit Unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 in ensuring the continuing solvency and liquidity of credit unions safeguards the interests of credit union savers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">In line with changes in the regulatory environment for financial services generally the need for modernisation of the credit union SPS has become evident over time. Section 46 of the Credit Union Act 1997 provides for approval of savings protection schemes by the Registrar of Credit Unions as the delegate of the Regulatory Authority. Once an approved scheme is in place under the Act it would be incumbent on all credit unions to participate. This highlights the importance of ensuring that an approved savings protection arrangement is consistent with the requirements of the credit union movement as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">Proposals for reform of the SPS were the subject of discussions in early 2007 between the Registrar and ILCU.  In November 2007 detailed proposals for the reform of SPS were submitted for approval.  I have written to the Chairman of the Financial Regulator confirming my view that an approved savings protection scheme for all credit unions should be in place as soon as possible. In this respect the Chairman of the Financial Regulator has recently advised me that it is the intention of the Financial Regulator to deal with outstanding issues such as governance and funding arrangements for the scheme and to urgently find a solution to this issue. I will be monitoring progress towards this objective in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1547">The Deputy will appreciate that higher levels of court proceedings for property repossessions need to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases and the fact that not all of the proceedings relate to residential property. It should also be noted that even where orders are secured some are not enforced. The number of orders granted by the High Court are a very small proportion — representing less than 0.2% — of the number of new mortgages issued in the same year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Unfortunately, a small minority of borrowers develop debt problems but house repossession is generally a last resort for lenders. I understand that member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have voluntarily adopted a Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears and a Code of Practice for Personal Customers.  These include provisions for helping customers in financial difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code requires financial service providers to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers.  In addition, the Code sets out the requirement that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that they must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears. In addition, from 1 January 2007 staff providing advice or selling mortgage loans must meet minimum competency requirements as laid down by the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">As Minister for Finance I have consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and in particular the need to factor into their financial decision making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1552">The Benchmarking Body has produced a report in accordance with its terms of reference.  It is agreed between Government and the trade unions that the best approach to ensuring that individual public service grades are paid appropriately, is to compare all aspects of public sector jobs with their private sector equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">Public service pay should neither lead nor fall behind market rates generally. Benchmarking provides that assurance, and is applied on top of the standard terms of national pay agreements, which apply in both the public and the private sector. Benchmarking, therefore, is an insurance policy for public service workers that they do not fall behind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">Given that the first Benchmarking Report established that an average 8.9% increase was required to restore reasonable parity with the private sector, and given that pay increases in the private sector have tended to reflect the terms of the national pay agreements since then, there should be no surprise that further increases are not generally warranted at this point.  This is particularly the case given the increase, in relative terms, of the value of a public sector pension over what prevails in the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">It was always envisaged that there would be issues to discuss after the Benchmarking Report in the context of the forthcoming pay talks.  That will now happen.  It is, however, scarcely credible that people will approach those talks on the basis that they have an entitlement to a higher increase than would otherwise arise simply because their salaries have not fallen behind the private sector over the past five years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that arrears of tax and duty amounted to €1,107 million as at 31st March 2007, which are the latest stable figures available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">Of the debt of €1,107m, €163m was under control. This means that the debt is being managed, generally through an agreed instalment arrangement where additional time to pay is given by Revenue. €402m was under active collection while €227m was at enforcement. This gives a total of €792m under active collection/enforcement or under control. The balance of €315m was under appeal and therefore not available for collection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Collectible debt represents a snapshot of debt at a particular point in time [in this instance 31 March 2007] and is a constantly changing figure as additional debt arises and activity by Revenue results in debt being collected. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that, the collectible debt of €792m plus any additional charges that subsequently arise for the period involved, will be reduced by up to 97% by the end of 2011. The remaining balance will be under control, under appeal or at enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve a reduction over a five-year period are the subject of annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process. In addition Revenue's new Statement of Strategy 2008-2010, which will be finalised very shortly, will set out the broad direction and focus of Revenue with regard to debt management for the next three years and seek to build on the very good progress in debt reduction that has been achieved in recent years. Revenue debt as a percentage of gross collection is now one of the lowest of any tax administration.</p>

         the constraints that directives from the European Union put on the ability of Ireland to make changes to the VAT regime here, including the State’s ability to make changes to the number of VAT bands and the rates which they are set at.

            <p eId="para_1567">The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Whilst it would not be possible to provide a detailed breakdown of the complex rules and regulations governing VAT, the following summary addresses the specific points raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">Under the EU VAT Directive, Member States may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">This means that since 1 January 1991 no additional goods or services can have the zero VAT rate applied to them. However, it is possible to move existing zero rated items, as appropriate, to either the reduced rate which in Ireland is 13.5% or the standard rate which is 21%. However, once moved, it would not be possible to revert them to the zero rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Member States may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5 per cent for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive. The goods and services in Annex III include certain foods, non-oral medicines, supply, construction and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy, and newspapers and periodicals. Goods and services at the reduced rate may be moved to the standard rate, but only those listed in Annex III may be reverted from the standard rate to the reduced rate. Ireland, in common with the vast majority of Member States, only operates one reduced VAT rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">In addition, Member States have the option of maintaining, at a reduced rate of not less than 12 per cent, any items not listed in Annex III, provided they carried the reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These items are considered to be ‘parked' and Ireland's parked rate is the same as our reduced rate of 13.5%. Domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services are examples of "parked" items.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Member States must apply a standard VAT rate of not less than 15% to goods and services that are not subject to VAT at the zero rate, are not ‘parked' and which are not listed in Annex III of the EU VAT Directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1574">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State must register for VRT purposes within seven days of arrival. This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non EU persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">However, Section 135(a) of the Finance Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign registered vehicle which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State to be exempted from the requirement to register for vehicle registration tax purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">These provisions are in line with Article 39 of the EU Treaty which provides for the free movement of people within the EU.  A reciprocal arrangement is also in place for our own State residents in other Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">The Deputy may wish to note that there is no legislative requirement to have insurance prior to registering a vehicle and that matters relating to car insurance are under the remit of the Department of Transport.

In order to monitor our performance against this and other commitments in the Charter, we conduct an annual survey of our main customer groups, as well as using other evaluation mothods such as mystery shopping, customer feedback, interviews and focus groups.  We then report on progress against the commitments in our Charter in our Annual Reports.</p>

While there is no evidence to suggest that these results do not represent a true picture of how our customers perceive us, it would nevertheless provide added re-assurance if they could be validated independently.  This would ensure that the results can withstand external scrutiny and, hopefully, provide further confirmation that we continue to meet the commitments in our Charter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">I travelled to South Africa from 13th to 15th January and to Tanzania from 15th to 18th January, 2008. The purpose of the visits were to further develop Irish-South African bilateral relations and promote business links between our two countries and to visit Irish Aid funded development projects in both South Africa and Tanzania.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">The official delegation included Mr. Micheál Martin, T.D., Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who accompanied me for the visit to South Africa and Mr. Michael Kitt, T.D., Minister of State for Overseas Development, who travelled to both South Africa and Tanzania. The official delegation included the Ambassador of Ireland to South Africa and the Ambassador of Ireland to Tanzania. The remainder of the official delegation included the Government Press Secretary and senior officials of my Department and of the Department of Foreign Affairs (including Irish Aid), the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and appropriate security personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">I was accompanied to South Africa for the trade element of the visit by representatives from Irish Economic Agencies including Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and IDA Ireland.  I was also accompanied by a media delegation with representatives from RTE and the print media.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">A full list of my official delegation and the accompanying delegations to both South Africa and Tanzania is set out below for the Deputy's information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">The delegation travelled to and from Africa by commercial flights. An aircraft was chartered for internal travel within Africa, following a tendering procedure carried out by the Department of Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The visit to Africa was managed with a view to both economy and efficiency. As Head of Government, I was a guest of the respective governments of South Africa and Tanzania.  My Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are responsible for the travel and hospitality costs for the official delegation and the accompanying delegation, the security delegation and for the internal travel costs within Africa and hospitality for the media delegation.  The economic agencies cover their own costs.  It is too early to give a figure for the total cost of the visit as accounts with many suppliers (e.g. travel, hotels and catering) have yet to be finalised and the allocation of costs between Departments has to be completed. My Department's outcome will not be settled for some weeks to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">I do, however, give an undertaking to the Deputy that full details of the cost of the visit will be supplied to him once the accounts have been finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1773">The Age Action Ireland "Getting Started" project was funded in 2006 and 2007 under the ASC (Access, Skills and Content) Initiative.  The ASC Initiative, previously called the eInclusion Fund, provides funding to voluntary, not-for-profit organisations for projects to support the participation of late adopters of technology in an inclusive knowledge society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">The "Getting Started" programme is an ICT instructional programme for older people which involves a basic training module in using a computer, accessing the Internet and using applications (such as MS Word).  Under the programme Circle of Friends support groups are established from the trainees to support other older people in ICT skills, facilitated by support teams from corporate partners, including Hibernian and IBM.  Funding was provided to Age Action Ireland in 2006 to pilot the programme in Galway and Dublin, on the basis that additional funding would be sought from the corporate partners to sustain and develop the programme.  In 2007 further funding was given to expand the programme in Dublin and Galway, and to introduce it in Donegal, Monaghan, Mayo, Kerry, Cork and Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">Initial reports of the "Getting Started" programme are positive.  Staff at the ISPU (Information Society Policy Unit) in my Department will be focusing on a number of the initiatives funded under the ASC Initiative, including "Getting Started", to assess the extent of the benefits being achieved for the target groups and to identify best practice.  I would hope and expect that Age Action Ireland's "Getting Started" programme will emerge as an example of good practice.  Funding support for further initiatives under ASC or its successor will have regard to the findings of the project assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">Up to €3m has been provided in the Department of the Taoiseach Vote this year for the funding of eInclusion initiatives, including the Seniors Outreach Programme which will show older people how computers, the internet and mobile phones can be relevant and useful to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">I will be looking at a number of ways of assisting older people to embrace the knowledge society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1947">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the control of import points, including private airfields, for the prevention of the smuggling of illegal drugs is primarily the responsibility of the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">The Revenue Commissioners are aware of the seizure of a substantial amount of heroin in Belgium in 2006 and reported links between that seizure and an aircraft based at a licensed aerodrome in this jurisdiction. However, I am advised that neither the Customs Service, nor the Gardaí, with whom Customs work in close co-operation and share intelligence, have evidence that private airfields have been used for the importation of supply quantities of illegal drugs over the past five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">The Commissioners also advise me that while there have been no supply quantities of illegal drugs detected, there have been 29 seizures during that period, of which 11 occurred in 2007, by Customs of small "own use" quantities of drugs from passengers at some of the relatively smaller airports/aerodromes, including Ireland West Knock, Waterford, Kerry and Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">In 2007 the Customs Service carried out an extensive review of controls at private airfields and have implemented the recommendations arising from that review.  The Commissioners are satisfied that the existing controls are effective and proportionate and in line with best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">Both Customs and Gardaí meet regularly and work closely together to improve co-operation with the operators of small aerodromes and to help them prevent the use of their facilities by persons involved in international drug trafficking.</p>

            <p eId="para_1988">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that where rents are paid directly to a person who is resident outside the State, the tenant is obliged to deduct income tax at the standard rate of 20% from the rental payment and to give the landlord a certificate of the tax deducted. Direct payments include a situation where rent is paid into a bank account in the name of the non-resident landlord. The tenant is then required to make a return and pay to Revenue the tax that he or she has deducted from the rent. The landlord is entitled to a credit for the tax deducted by the tenant against his or her final rental income tax liability and is obliged to pay any additional tax that may be due.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">The tenant is not responsible for discharging the landlord's liability to tax on rental income. Instead, the withholding of tax on rental income by tenants of non-resident landlords is primarily a control measure. It is designed to promote greater compliance in this area having regard to the obvious risk factors associated with non-resident taxpayers. Where it applies, it provides in a very direct manner, valuable information for Revenue which might otherwise be difficult to obtain.</p>

            <p eId="para_1999">Government recognises the contribution and the value for money that small businesses can provide in public procurement and encourages participation to the greatest extent possible. The consultation with stakeholders carried out during 2007 was undertaken to identify the issues that impacted on the small business sector in the current public procurement market. It did not envisage publication of a report; the purpose was to invite responses which identified perceived problems and consider possible practical solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">Significant measures have been introduced which make it easier to bid for public contracts. A national public procurement website (www.etenders.gov.ie) was developed by my Department in recent years where all significant public sector contracts are now advertised. This central facility, which is available free of charge, increases transparency and greatly facilitates access to public sector contracts for all suppliers. Figures show a steady increase in the number of registered suppliers competing for business. The small and medium enterprise (SME) sector has been actively targeted through a marketing campaign and suppliers now receive free email alerts to tender notices of interest to them. Two workshops were organised by the National Public Procurement Policy Unit (NPPPU) during 2007 to highlight opportunities and inform suppliers on up to date developments on the public tendering website. The Unit also participates regularly in SME public procurement events arranged by other stakeholders, such as other public sector agencies and business representative organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">Recent guidelines issued by the NPPPU on implementing new framework arrangements, involving aggregation of requirements, encourages authorities to ensure that where smaller enterprises can meet requirements or compete for particular lots, the terms of the framework facilitate their inclusion. Further measures to address the issues identified in consultation with stakeholders, such as other possible measures to simplify the public tendering process, will be undertaken as appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2085">Regarding the overall programme I am informed by the Central Decentralisation Unit in my Department that the estimated gross cost of the property aspects of the original decentralisation programme was €900m at the outset of the programme (2004 prices).  This was based on provision of accommodation for 10,300 staff outside of Dublin.  The overall number of staff for which accommodation is required has increased since the announcement of the programme due to additional bodies and locations being added to the programme, changes to business functions of certain organisations, additional space required for work-sharing staff, planned future expansion etc. and consolidation of certain existing regional offices into new buildings.  Based on the costs incurred to date,the OPW expects that the direct cost of providing accommodation for this increased number of staff will be contained within the overall envelope.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">While the majority of posts have not yet moved from Dublin, the OPW has been able to dispose of property in Dublin being held for future expansion because the announcement of the decentralisation programme clarified that most future expansion of Civil Service accommodation would not be in central Dublin.  Total income from such property disposed of between January 2004 and December 2007 was €387.5 million.  In addition property valued at €75 million was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.  In addition the OPW has agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of circa €125 million up to the end of 2007 and further ongoing large property disposals are planned having regard to progress with staff moves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">As expected, non-property costs have been increasing since the beginning of 2007 as more advance accommodation is in place, staff training has increased and actual moves have taken place.  At end June 2007, the total non-property costs incurred amounted to approximately €9m.

One hundred and twenty three (123) staff of my Department have already decentralised to Tullamore and a further two (2) have accepted offers of decentralisation.  Of those in Tullamore eighty two (82) staff transferred from Dublin posts, twenty five (25) staff were serving in various other locations in the country and sixteen(16)staff were recruited specifically for Tullamore.  It is envisaged that a further five (5) will have relocated to Tullamore by the end of 2008.  About thirty (30) further posts in my Department are scheduled to decentralise to County Kildare during 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that forty-eight (48) staff of their Office have decentralised to temporary accommodation in Limerick in preparation for the move to Newcastle West and a further two (2) officers have accepted offers of decentralisation.  Of those in the temporary accommodation in Limerick, two (2) were serving in Dublin prior to moving to Limerick. Fifty seven (57) staff have decentralised to Kilrush.  Of those, five (5) were based in Dublin. Fifty-one (51) staff have decentralised to Listowel. Of those, eight (8) were based in Dublin.  A further officer (1) has accepted an offer to decentralise to Listowel. An advance party of forty-six (46) staff have decentralised to Athy. Of those, forty three (43) were based in Dublin.  A further five (5) officers have accepted offers to decentralise to Athy, three (3) of whom are based in Dublin.  The Office of Public Works are examining a number of possibilities for permanent accommodation in Athy.  Eighty (80) staff have decentralised to Navan. Of those, seventy seven (77) were based in Dublin.  A further six (6) officers have accepted offers to decentralise to Navan, five (5) of whom are based in Dublin.  Arrangements are underway for their relocation to Navan.</p>

Of the personnel concerned, five (5) were based in Dublin and twenty four (24) were based outside of Dublin.  The OPW are currently planning an advance office in Trim, which involves the transfer of some 30 posts in 2008, and these personnel are based in Dublin.  The OPW has 187 staff in place in Dublin with a view to moving to their decentralised HQ in Trim.</p>

To date, no staff have been decentralised by the Public Appointments Service, or the Valuation Office.   However ten (10) staff in the PAS and eleven (11) staff in the Valuation Office are currently in posts in Dublin awaiting a transfer to Youghal.

            <p eId="para_2214">The Office of Public Works has confirmed that there are no current applications for planning permission in their direct name.  In the case of all projects associated with the Decentralisation Programme, planning permission, where required, is sought at an early stage of the procurement process.  Where buildings are being procured on a Design and Build basis, the matter of obtaining a satisfactory planning permission is the responsibility of the preferred tenderer who has been selected for the particular project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">Regarding the overall programme I am informed by the Central Decentralisation Unit in my Department that the estimated gross cost of the property aspects of the original decentralisation programme was €900m at the outset of the programme (2004 prices).  This was based on provision of accommodation for 10,300 staff outside of Dublin.  The overall number of staff for which accommodation is required has increased since the announcement of the programme due to additional bodies and locations being added to the programme (390 posts), changes to business functions of certain organisations (260 posts), additional space required for worksharing staff, planned future expansion, consultants, etc. (150) and consolidation of certain existing regional offices into new buildings (270).  From the costs incurred to date, the OPW anticipates that the direct cost of providing accommodation for this increased number of staff will be contained within the overall envelope.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">As expected, non-property costs have been increasing since the beginning of 2007 as more advance accommodation is in place, staff training has increased and actual moves have taken place.  At end June 2007, the total non-property costs incurred amount to approximately €9m. This reflects the significant rate of progress across decentralising organisations this year in furthering their implementation arrangements.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2229">Section 41 of the Finance Act 2002 inserted Section 847A into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Section 848A of the same Act is also relevant to the Deputy's question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">These two sections provide for a scheme of tax relief in respect of donations to certain sports bodies (Section 847A), and in respect of donations to certain charities and other approved bodies (Section 848A).</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">Section 847A gives tax relief for donations to approved sports bodies for the funding of approved capital projects costing up to €40 million.  The minimum qualifying donation in any year to an approved sports body is €250.  Eligibility for the relief centres on two key criteria — the sports body must be an ‘approved sports body' and the donation must be for the purposes of an ‘approved project'.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">An ‘approved sports body' is one that has a valid tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners and a statement, also from Revenue (in accordance with Section 235 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997), that the body is exempt from tax because it is established solely for the purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports and its income is applied solely to that purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">An ‘approved project' is a capital project, costing up to €40 million, approved by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">Similar to Section 847A, Section 848A provides for tax relief for certain charities and other approved bodies, including first and second level schools and third level institutions, in respect of donations received.  In order to qualify for the relief, the minimum donation to any one eligible charity or approved body in a year is €250.  A charity must have charitable status approved by the Revenue Commissioners for at least two years in order to qualify under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">The two year rule allows charities to establish a track record of charitable activities as set out in their founding documents, and it enables the Revenue Commissioners to examine an audited set of accounts from any charity wishing to avail of the donations scheme.  This is an important element of the scheme and is designed to ensure that the public can be confident that their donations and the tax relief provided by the Exchequer will be used for bona fide charitable purposes only.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">The arrangements for allowing tax relief for donations are the same for Section 847A (sports bodies) and Section 848A (charities and other approved bodies).  They depend on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a self-assessed taxpayer, or a company.  In the case of donation by a PAYE taxpayer, the tax relief is given to the sports body, charity, or other approved body; in the case of a self-assessed taxpayer, the relief is claimed by the self-assessed individual himself or herself; in the case of a company, the company is entitled to claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense for the relevant accounting period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2268">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that approximately 420 primary and post-primary schools have been granted charitable tax exemption.  A list of bodies which have been granted charitable tax exemption under Section 207 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">Since 2001, all primary and post primary schools providing education based on a programme prescribed or approved by the Minister for Education and Science automatically qualify as approved bodies for the purposes of the donations scheme under Section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. There are approximately 4,000 such schools in the State.   A full list of all individual bodies approved for the purpose of the donations scheme, as well as the terms and conditions of the scheme and the relevant forms, are available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">The donations scheme provides tax relief for donations to approved bodies, including eligible charities.  The precise arrangements for allowing tax relief on donations to charities varies depending on whether the donor is a PAYE taxpayer, a self-assessed taxpayer, or a company.  In the case of a donation by a PAYE taxpayer, the tax relief is given on a ‘grossed up' basis to the eligible charity or other approved body, as the case may be, rather than by way of a separate claim to tax relief by the donor.  The claim for refunds is made by the eligible charity or approved body.  In the case of a self-assessed doner, the relief is claimed by the self-assessed individual himself or herself (and there is no grossing up arrangement).  In the case of a company, the company is entitled to claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense for the relevant accounting period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that because of these different arrangements for claiming the relief, it is not possible to provide all the information sought by the Deputy (this is because in the case of donations by self-assessed taxpayers and companies, the relief is claimed by the self-assessed or corporate donors rather than refunded to the charity).  However, the following table sets out the refunds of tax made by Revenue to primary and post-primary schools in 2006 and 2007, in respect of  donations made to them by individual PAYE donors only.</p>

            <p eId="para_2337">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must withdraw the existing excise reliefs. The Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007. At the Commission's behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">In the case of public passenger transport services, including school transport services, the Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments, in conjunction with my Department, are exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.

A person who wishes to reserve a registration number may do so by applying to the Central Vehicle Office in Rosslare, Co. Wexford.

            <p eId="para_2408">The Business Expansion Scheme, which was subject to a thorough review in 2006 and renewed and extended in Budget 2007, is not available for the development of hotel or guest-house accommodation. Most asset-backed projects have, in fact, been removed from the scope of the BES for a number of years at this stage and I regard it as important to ensure that the BES remains focused away from such asset-backed projects and towards the incentivisation of risk capital investment in appropriate businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">As the Deputy will be aware, the BES is an approved State Aid. Any changes to the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy would require the prior approval of the European Commission having regard to the relevant EU guidelines on risk capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">However, it should be noted that the Business Expansion Scheme is already available to companies operating in a number of tourism categories, such as hostels, camp sites, holiday centres, tour bus operators, boat hire and sports facilities, so there is plenty of scope for tourism entrepreneurs to avail of its advantages.</p>

Appropriate sanctions have been, and are, taken against staff under the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">Revenue's Security and Confidentiality Policy informs all staff of the continuing need to maintain the highest level of confidentiality and security regarding access to and control of information used for Revenue business purposes.  Revenue staff are regularly reminded of the need to protect the confidentiality of information concerning members of the public.  Staff are also regularly reminded that access to Revenue information is authorised only in circumstances where there is a clear official business reason requiring such access and that any unauthorised access constitutes a serious breach of discipline and will be dealt with accordingly. Data, security systems and procedures are regularly reviewed as part of Revenue's business and strategic planning processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">In relation to the Office of Public Works, when setting  up the Freedom of Information Website in June 2004, the names of all those making requests were published. In addition, the addresses of private individuals were mistakenly displayed along with the addresses of businesses/journalists etc. This error has been rectified.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">Following consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the use of individual's names, OPW is currently in the process of removing the names of all requesters from its website and has amended its FOI acknowledgement letters to reflect this change.</p>

            <p eId="para_2443">The Government made a decision (which I announced in November 2007) to review the systems and procedures operated by Departments and Agencies which are in place to protect the confidentiality of personal data and to prevent its improper release. In that context, my Department is required to furnish the Government with a report. Consequently, my Department has written to all Departments and Offices requesting details of the systems and procedures in place. These details are scheduled to be returned to the Department of Finance by 1st February 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2460">The Deputy may wish to note that increased competition in the Irish financial services sector over recent years, reflecting such factors as new entrants and the introduction of a switching code for both personal customers and now for the business sector, has benefited consumers in Ireland significantly through increased choice, new products, lower prices and better service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">The Financial Regulator regularly publishes surveys on its website www.itsyourmoey.ie comparing the costs of various financial products and services provided by various financial service providers in the State. These surveys provide consumers with the information they require to make informed choices as customers of financial institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">It is a matter for the Financial Regulator in the context of discharging its statutory consumer protection mandate to determine the nature and type of information which is most relevant to consumers in assisting them in making financial decisions. In assessing the balance between the likely benefits and costs of providing various types of information for consumers the Financial Regulator can draw on the advice and guidance of the Financial Services Consultative Consumer Panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">The Deputy will appreciate that on account of such factors as differences in retail market structures, consumer preferences and charging structures, international cost comparisons must be interpreted carefully.  However, comparative international information available for Ireland indicates that in overall terms the cost of personal or small business banking compare favourably with other developed countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2464">The introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) from 28 January 2008 should also be a factor that promotes greater competition in the market for payment services across Europe, and potentially yield to Irish consumers the benefits of participating in a market with much larger economies of scale. The Deputy may be aware that the SEPA is the area where citizens, companies and other economic actors will be able to make and receive payments in euros, within Europe, whether between or within national boundaries under the same basic conditions, rights and obligations, regardless of their location.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2471">(a)5% from 14 September 2007, the date of the Report, or where the total increase is less than 5%, the full increase from that date;</p>

            <p eId="para_2478">Each relevant employer implements the increases to those grades under its remit covered by the Review Body. The amount of "back pay" depends on the date the payments are actually made. I do not have the information on the payment date for each such employer but based on the phasing, 5% of the recommended increase would be payable from 14 September 2007, except in the case of political office holders.</p>

            <p eId="para_2487">Responsibility for the administration of the various tax clearance schemes is assigned in legislation to the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised by Revenue that a tax clearance certificate will normally be issued to a person whose tax affairs are up to date. This means that at the time of the application, the person:</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">has made all of the required tax returns to Revenue and</p>
            <p eId="para_2489">has paid all tax known to be due or agreed a payment schedule in respect of such tax debts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2490">Where an applicant for tax clearance does not meet the criteria mentioned, a formal notification of refusal is issued by Revenue. This notification sets out the basis for refusal of the application, and this refusal can be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2491">In other words, an applicant applies and the certificate is either granted or refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_2492">In relation to tax clearance for holders of public office, the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 provides for the request for, and issue of, an Application Statement where a person has applied for a tax clearance certificate to the Collector-General of the Revenue Commissioners and</p>
            <p eId="para_2493">no decision has been taken on the application by the Collector-General, or</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">the Collector-General has refused to issue a certificate but the refusal is the subject of an appeal yet to be determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">In these circumstances, in accordance with the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the Collector-General will, on request, provide an Application Statement to the applicant confirming that the person has applied for a tax clearance certificate and that no decision on the application has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">The Deputy will be aware that where a person provides an Application Statement to the Standards in Public Office Commission, the person is deemed not to be in breach of the requirement to produce a tax clearance certificate under the Standards in Public Office Act. This position continues to apply until such time as a decision is made on the application for a certificate or on the appeal against a refusal, as the case may be.</p>

            <p eId="para_2523">The primary responsibility for managing a bank and for preventing fraud within that bank rests with the board and management of that institution. No supervisory regime can ensure that a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent activity. However, it is a key principle of our regulatory approach that any financial institutions are expected to have in place internal oversight, reporting and risk management systems commensurate to the nature, size and complexity of their operations that are up to the task of properly managing and controlling the risks with which they deal and minimising the scope for fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_2524">As Minister of Finance I am responsible for the legal framework governing financial regulation. In the context of the legislative framework put in place, responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions is a matter for the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</p>

I would of course consider any approach by the Financial Regulator in relation to new legislation in this regard, if the Financial Regulator regards this as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The remit of the Financial Regulator is quite broad and covers a wide range of financial service activities.  All in all the Financial Regulator supervises more than 10,000 financial service providers of varying size and nature, including banking, insurance, collective investment, asset management firms, as well as credit unions, exchanges, retail intermediaries etc.  Our regulatory regime meets best practice international standards.

            <p eId="para_2528">Recent IDA Ireland data show that 2007 was another positive year with regard to new investment projects coming to Ireland. The data also show that many of the new jobs were in highly skilled, high paying areas. Based on a healthy pipeline of prospective new projects, the IDA is confident that Ireland is well placed to secure considerable investment during 2008, from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, International Services, Information and Communications Technology, Financial Services and Digital Media.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that Ireland remains an attractive location for inward foreign direct investment and policies are in place to achieve this. Our burden of tax is low, and we have demonstrated that we pursue sensible budgetary policies. Our workforce is highly skilled and flexible. Infrastructural development has been prioritised. These key policy orientations equip Ireland with the skills, infrastructure, facilities and overall operating environment that will allow us to compete effectively for projects at the upper end of the high skill/high wage spectrum, which is where our competitive advantage now lies.</p>

            <p eId="para_2531">The Government recognises the importance of achieving sustainable export-led growth in order to enhance living standards in Ireland. In this regard this Government is pursuing a number of policies which will underpin the future growth of our economy, including pursuing responsible budgetary policies. We have for a number of years actively focussed on rewarding work and enterprise through maintaining a low tax burden on capital and labour. Furthermore, I have already indicated that a key priority is the continued roll out of the National Development Plan. Investment in capital — human and physical — as well as infrastructural investment designed to eliminate bottlenecks will go some way towards enhancing productivity. Also the ongoing consensus approach to pay determination is another key factor in safeguarding our economic well-being.</p>

            <p eId="para_2533">Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. While inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, averaged 4.9% last year, my Department's latest forecast is for an average CPI of 3% this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2534">Including the impact of mortgage rate increases in the CPI not only masks the underlying inflation rate but also highlights the short-term impact of interest rate increases which are designed to bring down inflation. As such, a better measure of inflation than the Consumer Price Index is the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) which excludes, among other things, mortgage interest and is a more realistic measure of inflation. The average increase in the HICP in 2007 was 2.8 per cent, and the forecast increase for 2008 is 2.4 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">As I indicated at Budget time, I expect the rate of inflation to moderate over the course of this year. However, it must be acknowledged that we have no control over some of the factors influencing inflation, such as oil prices, the exchange rate and mortgage interest rates in the case of the CPI. In this regard, we must always seek to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. Seeking to maintain low inflation, the pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels in the medium term are important. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_2544">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with the Department's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland. The Act also limits packaging and labelling of controlled drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">Herbal drugs is a vernacular term used to describe a range of different substances which may or may not be scheduled substances under Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular the Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.   For example,  in 2006 the law surrounding psychotropic (magic) mushrooms in their raw state was clarified in the light of evidence of increased availability and significant harm being done and it is now an offence to sell or possess magic mushrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">One of the substances currently on sale is Benzlpiperazine (BZP).  BZP is not currently a scheduled substance under Misuse of Drugs legislation, but its status is under advanced review.  A specific risk assessment procedure for new psychoactive substances carried out by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has found that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if long term effects of the substance are still unknown.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">The European Commission has therefore, decided to ask the Council of Ministers to place BZP under control in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If the Council adopts the Commission's proposal, Member States must act as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of the decision, to introduce control measures and criminal sanctions. For Ireland, the introduction of national measures will involve declaring BZP to be a controlled substance under Irish Misuse of Drugs legislation and adding it to the schedule of controlled substances in accordance with that legislation.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_2564">There are no plans to introduce an Irish Older Person's Bill as referred to by the Deputy.  However, I am delighted to inform the Deputy that the Office for Older People will be formally launched by the Taoiseach on Wednesday 30th January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">The main functions of the new Office will be to establish an interdepartmental network to draw up and implement a Strategy for Positive Ageing; to bring greater coherence to the formulation of policy affecting older people at a cross-departmental level and to develop policy and oversee and monitor the delivery of health and personal social services for older people.  The Office will proactively lead the co-ordination of policy in relation to Services for Older People across relevant government departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2566">In response to the key issues raised by the Deputy in his question, I have outlined the most up to date position as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2567">1. Assessment of Needs</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2568">The Bill providing for the new Fair Deal Scheme is at an advanced stage. This legislation will establish a uniform national system of financial support for people in need of nursing home care.  Within this, the legislation will address the issue of an assessment of care needs for those who may need long-term residential care.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2569">2. Protection from Neglect and Abuse</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2570">Elder Abuse may involve physical, psychological, sexual or financial abuse or it may otherwise arise due to inadequacy of care for whatever reason. Following a comprehensive work programme the Working Group on Elder Abuse published its report, ‘Protecting Our Future' in 2002. This Report made various recommendations in relation to the development of health and non-health services necessary to deal with elder abuse. It recommended that the issue of elder abuse be placed in the wider context of health and social care services for older people. The Department of Health and Children established the Elder Abuse National Implementation Group (EANIG) in 2003 to oversee and guide the implementation of the elder abuse programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">The majority of the recommendations in relation to the development of the health services necessary to tackle elder abuse have been implemented. This includes, in recent times, the appointment by the HSE of Senior Case Workers and Dedicated Elder Abuse Officers nationally together with the development of improved training, protocols and other appropriate measures.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2572">3. Nursing Homes</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2573">Currently, private nursing homes are registered in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and are subject to inspection by the Health Service Executive on the basis of the standards set out in the Care and Welfare Regulations 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">A fundamental principle of the Health Service Reform Programme is to put the users of health and personal social services at the centre of the services.  The Health Act 2007 reflects this principle and provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The objective of the Authority is to promote safety and quality in the provision of health and personal social services for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2575">The existing inspection and registration systems for residential services will be replaced by a strengthened and expanded system and the Act strengthens and modernises the registration and de-registration process.   The Act also provided for the establishment of the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services with specific statutory functions for inspecting and registering residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) is liaising with HIQA to facilitate this and transitional arrangements will be agreed as we move towards the new system of inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_2576">Formal standards are a key requirement for inspection and registration.  An important function of the Authority is the setting of standards on safety and quality in relation to services providing by the Health Service Executive and service providers to monitor compliance on the part of the HSE and service providers with these standards in an open and transparent way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2577">A new set of draft national standards for residential care was published in January 2007 by the Minister for Health &amp; Children.  The draft standards are designed to ensure the protection of residents, to safeguard and promote their health, welfare and quality of life and to ensure that there is a focus on the well-being, dignity and autonomy of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2578">As the Health Act, 2007 provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by HIQA, the draft standards were formally referred to the Authority for consultation and finalisation.  HIQA published draft standards on 8 August, 2007 for public consultation. The results of the public consultation were discussed at the most recent meetings of the HIQA Working Group and it is expected that the standards will be finalised shortly.  The next step will be to refer the standards to the Minister, following which Regulations will be drafted to give statutory underpinning to the Standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_2580">I am delighted to inform the Deputy that the Office for Older People will be formally launched by the Taoiseach on Wednesday 30th January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2581">The main functions of the new Office will be to establish an interdepartmental network to draw up and implement a Strategy for Positive Ageing; to bring greater coherence to the formulation of policy affecting older people at a cross-departmental level and to develop policy and oversee and monitor the delivery of health and personal social services for older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2582">A critical component of the Office will be to create a "whole of government" approach to older people — both in terms of policy development and service delivery.  This will involve a critical function of developing working relationships with key government departments and formalising networks and lines of communication to embed this approach in all aspects of government.  The Office will proactively lead the co-ordination of policy in relation to Services for Older People across relevant government departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2583">In the context of developing a National Strategy for Positive Ageing, special attention will be paid to the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (MIPAA) referred to by the Deputy.  The new Office for Older People will be the focal point for the MIPAA process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">The Plan listed objectives and recommendations for action under three priority directions:</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">older persons and development</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">advancing health and well-being into old age</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">enabling and supportive environments</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">These objectives are reflected in the overall functions of the new Office as outlined above and will feature strongly in the new Strategy for Positive Ageing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The role of non-Governmental organisations in the implementation, assessment and follow-up of the Plan was also acknowledged and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a National Advisory Council for Older People will be established as part of the overall arrangements for the new Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2590">The process of implementation of MIPAA is an evolving one and the establishment of the Office for Older People is an important development in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_2636">I propose to take Questions Nos. 292, 293 and 296 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2637">A Voluntary Code on the marketing and advertising of alcohol is in place since 2005. The 2006 Annual Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body, established to monitor compliance with the Voluntary Codes, was submitted to my Department in July 2007. Following consideration of the Report, officials from my Department commenced discussions with representatives of the Irish alcohol industry and representatives of the Irish advertising industry with a view to strengthening and expanding the voluntary codes on alcohol marketing and communications in order to provide significantly greater protection for children and young people. A representative from the Health Service Executive also participated in the discussions. My Department did not invite submissions from any organisation during this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2638">Following publication of the Report entitled Working Together to Reduce the Harms Caused by Alcohol Misuse an Implementation Group was established to monitor and report on progress on the implementation of the recommendations contained in this Report.  The Implementation Group's membership comprises key stakeholders in Government Departments and Agencies and the Social Partners. Both the voluntary youth sector and the drinks industry are represented on the Implementation Group. At its meeting in September 2007 the Implementation Group discussed alcohol advertising and the views of the various stakeholders in attendance were relayed to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2639">The discussions between my officials and the alcohol and advertising industry representatives resulted in a revised set of Codes on advertising and sponsorship being drafted. I am consulting with my officials in relation to the revised set of Codes to identify the most appropriate way of moving forward in this area. I am conscious of the need for Government to continue to respond to the problems caused by alcohol misuse in Ireland and I intend seeking support for the introduction of evidence-based measures to tackle these problems in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_2641">Under the proposed new nursing home support scheme, A Fair Deal, every individual will make a fair contribution to the cost of their care based on their income and, if applicable, their assets. The means assessment will work out how much each individual can contribute to the cost of their care. In the case of couples where one member requires care, the assessment is based on 50% of the couple's combined income and assets. The individual's spouse or partner will keep enough income to live comfortably. The means assessment will not take into account the means of other relatives such as their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Under the new scheme, individuals will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income per week, whether for public or private nursing home care. Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets. The State will then meet the balance of cost, whether in a public or an approved private nursing home.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">The portion of the contribution based on assets, such as a person's home, can be paid at the time of receiving care or it may be deferred, meaning that it will not have to be paid by the individual during their lifetime. In addition, the individual's spouse or certain dependants can avail of a further deferral of the contribution based on the principal residence for the duration of their lifetime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">The individuals who will be able to avail of the second deferred payment agreement include, among others, the spouse or co-habiting partner of the individual and a relative (as defined in the legislation) who is in receipt of a disability or similar allowance. The Bill providing for the Fair Deal scheme is at an advanced stage and being finalised by the Office of the Attorney General at present.  The Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, T.D. proposes to publish the Bill as soon as possible following Government approval.</p>

I am informed that the HSE intends to implement the revised wholesaler arrangements from 1st March 2008. The Executive also recently commenced discussions with the IPU and other parties on the development of a new substantive pharmacy contract. The details of the draft interim contract, and the HSE's other intentions in this regard, were set out in a letter to individual community pharmacists on 2nd January 2008.</p>

These arrangements may include the establishment of an independent body which would consider the nature of the service to be provided and all other relevant factors in each case and make recommendations to the Government in relation to the fees it considers appropriate. The composition of such a body, its terms of reference and the timescale for its work are amongst the matters to be considered in this regard. In line with the legal advice received, the HSE may enter into discussions with community pharmacists on the non-fee aspects of their contract, with a view to developing a new substantive pharmacy contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_2660">The introduction of nurse/midwife prescribing is a real and significant change in nursing practice in Ireland.  There is strong international experience that supports nurse/midwife prescribing as being effective and safe and improving services to patients.  The extension of prescriptive authority to nurse and midwives will ensure that patients will receive earlier interventions and therefore a better quality service.  Nurse/midwife prescribing will assist the development of a service based on the right person delivering the right care in the right setting at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">This initiative is fully supported by the nursing and midwifery professions across a range of disciplines.  In fact the first hospital to introduce nurse/midwife prescribing in Ireland is the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">Nurse/midwife prescribing will also promote the more effective utilisation of the nursing resource, both in terms of nurses/midwives and their skills and will facilitate the optimum utilisation of the medical resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">The provision of locum cover for medical practitioners who are providing supervision in the training component of the new nurse prescribing education programme is a matter for the Health Service Executive and I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2664">I am satisfied that appropriate arrangements are being put in place to facilitate the planned implementation of the nurse prescribing initiative.  It is my understanding that before a medical practitioner agrees to act as a mentor he/she is advised of the commitment required in relation to clinical supervision, support and learning opportunities for the student.  If an employer is unable to put adequate arrangements in place to support a nurse/midwife wishing to undertake the education programme, or if a medical practitioner is not in a position to give the required commitment to provide the relevant supervision, then the nurse/midwife in question will not be accepted onto the education programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">I fully support the concept of nurse/midwife prescribing and I understand that the roll-out of the initiative is happening in accordance with the implementation plan devised by the Resource and Implementation Group which was established by my Department and which is overseeing the project.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2678">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which, together with the earlier Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), are implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2681">With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced from 1st January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2683">When I announced the new scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to my Office in November and December as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed last month and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</p>
            <p eId="para_2685">services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;</p>
            <p eId="para_2686">where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</p>
            <p eId="para_2687">special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;</p>
            <p eId="para_2688">in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which would otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding is conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with, including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2690">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has applied to enter the new scheme and a letter of approval for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has issued from the Childcare Directorate.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.</p>

            <p eId="para_2756">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with the Department's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland, which could merit the criminalisation of their sale and use.  The Act also limits packaging and labelling of controlled drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular the Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.  For example, in 2006 the law surrounding psychotropic (magic) mushrooms in their raw state was clarified in the light of evidence of increased availability and significant harm being done and it is now an offence to sell or possess magic mushrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2758">Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is not currently a scheduled substance under Misuse of Drugs legislation, but its status is under advanced review.  Following a risk assessment of BZP carried out at EU level by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the European Commission has asked the Council of Ministers to place BZP under control in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. If the Council adopts the Commission's proposal, Member States must act as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of the decision, to introduce control measures and criminal sanctions.  Control measures and penalties are decided according to national laws which in turn comply with UN conventions.  For Ireland, the introduction of national measures will involve declaring BZP to be a controlled substance under Irish Misuse of Drugs legislation and adding it to the schedule of controlled substances in accordance with that legislation. The Council of Ministers is expected to make its decision on the control of BZP in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2768">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated University College Hospital Galway and Limerick Regional Hospital as the two cancer centres in the Managed Cancer Control Network for the HSE Western Region, which includes Sligo.  The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Prof. Keane is currently engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2773">At present, there is no limit in Irish statute in relation to intercountry adoption, nor is one applied by the Board in relation to the decision to issue a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability, the legal document required by prospective adoptive parents to complete an intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The Board advises applicants who are given a Declaration and who are 45 years of age and over that "the Board may not be in a position to renew the Declaration". This is a general advisory and relates to the capacity, in the future,  of prospective adoptive parents to meet standards 1 and 2 of the Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment. These standards relate to the capacity to safeguard a child throughout his or her childhood, and to raise that child to adulthood. Further details regarding the 5 standards can be provided to the Deputy, if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">The Adoption Board has found, in the past, that some applicants delay in using their Declaration. Clearly, it is important for the welfare of the child that prospective adopters proceed in a timely fashion.  The purpose of the advisory is to promote this. It is important to note that each application for the renewal of a Declaration is considered on its own merits, and in accordance with the information before the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently working closely with the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office on the drafting of the Adoption Bill, which is a priority within the Government's legislative programme. The issue of an age limit is under consideration and has been discussed as a part of a wide consultation process which is informing the drafting process. The Bill will have regard to transitional issues which will arise for applicants who have commenced, but not completed the adoption process on the enactment of the legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3073">I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_3074">In September 2005, "Reach Out" — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched. The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies. The HSE, through the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP), oversees the implementation of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3075">Additional funding of €1.85 million was provided in 2007 for the implementation of the Strategy bringing the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million and this level of funding continues into 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3076">Initiatives funded by the National Office for Suicide Prevention include developing and implementing national training programmes, completing the availability of self-harm services through A&amp;E departments, developing mental health awareness campaigns, implementing recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services, eleven dedicated suicide officers and supporting voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">It should also be emphasised that a wide range of other expenditure on mental health services generally is of importance in measures to help prevent suicide.  A total of some €1 billion is now spent on mental health services, including consultant psychiatry and psychiatric nursing.  These services play a vital role in the drive to reduce the incidence of suicide, and should be taken into account when examining the level of total public expenditure devoted to suicide prevention.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3134">I propose to take Questions Nos. 349, 352, 357, 358, 375, 432, 498 and 508 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3135">I acknowledge the need to improve services to persons with cystic fibrosis. Much of the debate has centred around the need for improved services at the National Adult Referral Centre at St. Vincent's University Hospital. The negative experience recounted by some patients is a matter of much concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_3136">I identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process in recent years. In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE). The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3137">The HSE advise that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis have been appointed to date across a number of hospitals, including St Vincent's, Beaumont, Temple Street, Crumlin, Tallaght, Cork University Hospital, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3138">I accept the need to improve the infrastructural facilities for persons with cystic fibrosis who are required to attend hospital. For example, at St.Vincent's Hospital, a number of capital projects have recently been completed and have helped to improve facilities. These include a new ambulatory care centre, which has dedicated accommodation (8 suites in total), incorporating single room facilities on an outpatient appointment basis for cystic fibrosis patients in an environment which allows for improved infection control; the refurbishment of St. Camillus Ward and the provision of 15 additional respiratory/cystic fibrosis beds bringing the bed complement to 44; the new Accident and Emergency Department includes single room accommodation, which may be used for the care of cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_3139">However, it is accepted that these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients. The HSE has been working intensively with the Hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements. My Department is advised that the option of developing a modular unit is being examined in this context and the position will be clarified shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3140">The HSE advises that it is fast-tracking the re-development of a ward which is adjacent to the main cystic fibrosis treatment area. The project is to commence within the next few weeks and will provide six single rooms. On completion, additional work will begin to provide a further eight single rooms. The HSE advise that this will result in a total of fourteen single rooms for cystic fibrosis patients by the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3141">In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation. The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities. My Department is advised that planning permission has been obtained and that financial provision has been included in the HSE Capital Plan. The HSE advises that contract notices will be published by the end of February 2008 and the contract is to be awarded by the end of 2008. It will be a condition of the contract that the design build period be not more than 24 months from the date of contract award.</p>
            <p eId="para_3142">Beaumont Hospital also operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of €2.5m capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_3143">A Cystic Fibrosis Registry has been set up by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. As yet, the data is not available to fully inform analysis relating to median survival in this country. When it is available, the data from the Registry will allow for benchmarking against comparable countries around the world to measure the performance of our healthcare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3144">My Department has asked the HSE to reply directly on any additional operational issues raised in the Deputies questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3148">My predecessor as Minister for Health and Children established an advisory group in 2001 to examine the feasibility of establishing a no fault scheme for infants who suffered cerebral damage at, or close to, the time of their birth. The group had undertaken a significant amount of work by early 2004 when it ceased to meet due to the dispute with hospital consultants on the introduction of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme. In 2006 I asked the chairman, Dr. Peter McKenna, to reconvene the group with a view to having a report produced. I understand that the group has been meeting on a regular basis and I am hopeful that it will deliver a report to me before the end of the year. I have arranged to meet Dr. McKenna early next month to be briefed on progress to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_3179">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3180">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3181">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3185">I am informed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) that, as part of a review in 2007 of the assessment process for medical cards and GP visit cards, one of the issues examined was the most appropriate way in which to take account of the costs incurred by applicants in travelling to work.  Accordingly, the Executive developed an assessment methodology using Automobile Association data on motoring costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3186">I understand that, since March 2007, in the assessment process these costs are reckoned on the following basis: an amount per mile/kilometre from home to place of employment (30 cent per mile); a weekly amount of €50 to cover standing charges (including car loan repayments).  These provisions replaced an arrangement whereby a simple 50 cent per mile was allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3187">My Department is currently carrying out a data collection exercise and review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards, which is expected to be completed by autumn 2008.  This will give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need, with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</p>

A vaccine to prevent against meningococcal infections, including meningococcal septicaemia, caused by the Meningococcus C strain of the bacteria is already included in the primary immunisation schedule. The vaccine referred to by the Deputy is pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC) which protects against pneumococcal infections, which include pneumonia, septicaemia and bacterial meningitis. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has produced new guidelines which include the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PVC) to the schedule. PVC vaccine provides a high level of protection to young children from pneumococcal infections.

            <p eId="para_3230">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3231">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3232">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

Before the establishment of the HSE, the nature of any arrangements for community physiotherapy services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards.  As a result, variation in practice developed over time. I understand that in some areas, the HSE has made arrangements with private physiotherapists to provide services to medical card holders who have been referred by their General Practitioners.

            <p eId="para_3252">The most effective strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer requires decisions based on an assessment of the relative contributions of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination and cervical screening in reducing the burden of both existing and projected cervical precancerous changes and cervical cancer.  Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has  undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS), agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study. One of the key functions of the Authority is the assessment of health technology, drugs and health promotion activities.  When I have received the policy advice from HIQA and NCSS I will make the necessary decisions that arise from the advice.The NCSS is planning to roll-out the National Cervical Screening Programme on a national basis this year.  A national cervical screening programme will still be required regardless of a decision on a HPV vaccination program this year.</p>

I have been informed that the HSE is in regular contact with the supplier, and is doing all it can do to ensure delivery of the vaccine at the earliest possible juncture. Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine in advance as it has a very short shelf life. It is anticipated that the HSE will receive fresh stocks of the vaccine in March.</p>

         the number of women who have died from breast cancer from 2000 to date in 2008 in the western region; and the number of those women who would have been eligible for free breast screening by BreastCheck, if the service had been rolled out in all parts of the country in February 2000, rather than the segmented roll-out of the service which occurred.

         the number of women aged 50 to 64 who have been denied free breast screening by BreastCheck in the western region due to the apartheid of services in the west when the service was initially offered in February 2000; the number of women who have missed out on this service as it simply was not available from February 2000 in the west and now because of their age will not be offered a mammogram.

            <p eId="para_3300">BreastCheck commenced national roll out in the Western Region last May, with the provision of a mobile unit on the grounds of Roscommon County Hospital.  I officially opened the BreastCheck clinical static unit for the Western Region at University College Hospital Galway last December.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Western region covers counties Mayo, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary North Riding.</p>
            <p eId="para_3301">An additional €26.7 million capital funding was provided to BreastCheck for the construction of two new clinical units, eight additional mobile units and the provision of state of the art digital equipment.  A total of €15 million additional revenue funding has been allocated to the National Cancer Screening Service to cater for national roll-out of the programme.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved and recruitment is underway.  Staffing already appointed include Clinical Directors, Consultant Radiologists, Consultant Surgeons, Consultant Histopathologists, Consultant Anaesthetists, Medical Scientists, Breast Care Nurses and Radiographers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3302">The Deputy's specific questions in relation to the Programme are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the Service to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matters raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_3330">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3331">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_3371">Over the last three years, the Government has funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with    €540 million being provided to ensure that older people receive as much care as possible in their homes; that high standards are set and enforced in all residential care settings; and that the cost of residential care is always affordable and never an anxiety.</p>
            <p eId="para_3372">In this context, and in order to address increasing demands in the specific area of Home Helps, approximately €56 million additional funding has been provided for service over the three years 2006-8 inclusive. This has enabled the provision of 11.3 million Home Help hours by the Health Service Executive in 2006 and 11.7 million hours in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3373">Budget 2008 provided significant additional current funding of €344 million to cover a range of priorities in the health sector, including a priority funding package of €25 million being targeted this year at a range of new community-based initiatives for Older People. This includes a sum of €5 million for this year towards 200,000 extra Home Help hours and an expected 220 new clients to avail of an expanded "Meals on Wheels" service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3374">Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the prioritised funding I have made available this year will assist the HSE in meeting increasing demands on its Home Help service.

            <p eId="para_3376">Over the three years 2006-8 inclusive, unprecedented levels of funding, in the region of  €215 million, have been provided for new community-based service initiatives associated with Older Persons.  The recent Budget provided significant additional overall funding of €344 million current and €52 million capital to meet a range of new priority initiatives this year, including:</p>
            <p eId="para_3377">€135 m for the introduction of the new long term residential care scheme — "A Fair Deal" and for complementary community supports for Older People;</p>
            <p eId="para_3378">€50 m for people with Disabilities</p>
            <p eId="para_3379">€29 m for cancer services, to bring total new cancer funding in 2008 to €35m; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3380">€12m for innovative service delivery projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3381">This new funding, combined with the pre-Budget Estimates, means that the HSE will receive a total underlying increase of almost 9% in 2008 to improve public health services overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382">Despite the many competing demands for new service developments across all areas of our public health system, and the changing economic circumstances generally in recent times within which we all have to plan and operate, I consider that the additional €25 million made available this year for enhanced community-based services for Older People is indeed significant.  This funding initiative will enable the Health Service Executive to improve access to these services and provide, for example:</p>
            <p eId="para_3383">€ 10 million for 360 extra Home Care Packages, which should benefit around 800 people, thus bringing the total number of packages available to over 4,700 by year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_3384">€5 million towards an extra 200,000 Home Help hours and allow 220 new clients avail of an expanded "Meals-on-Wheels" service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3385">€3.6 million towards the provision of over 340 Day Care places and over 1,200 new clients for Respite Care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3386">€2 million for enhanced supports at national level for voluntary groups delivering much needed services in partnership with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3387">€3 million towards improved service provision for Palliative Care, particularly for regions in need of greatest  improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3388">The implementation by the HSE of this important new funding initiative will be closely monitored by the Department during the course of the year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3390">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3391">Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3392">People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account a range of measures including the household income guidelines, particular circumstances and the medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   In addition people over the age of 70 years have an automatic entitlement to a medical card regardless of income.  Application should be made to the local area office of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3393">In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit — the GP Visit Card to extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on moderate incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3394">In June 2005, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards.  It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, childcare and travel to work.  In 2005 the income guidelines for medical cards were increased by a cumulative 29 per cent. The income assessment guidelines used for the GP visit card are 50% higher than those used for medical cards.  These improvements have made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3395">Non-medical card holders can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than   €90 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. In addition, the deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.</p>

The Service is in the process of procuring quality assured internationally accredited laboratory capacity.  The laboratories will be required to meet turnaround times of ten working days.  This process is due to be completed by end March.   In terms of smeartaker capacity, the Service completed a stakeholder consultation process in November 2007 and published a draft smeartaker contract for consultation in the first week of January this year.  This consultation process will end on 28 February next and the actual smeartaker contract will be published shortly thereafter.  The programme will be based on a turnaround time of four weeks for smear testing.  The Service is also carrying out a baseline quality audit of existing clinical colposcopy services in the State to establish their fitness for purpose in the context of a national cervical screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3418">Additional revenue funding of €5.0m was allocated to the Service in 2007 for the roll-out of the programme and an additional €15.0m has been allocated in 2008.  An additional 30 posts have been approved to facilitate integration and roll-out of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3428">The 2007 Pharmacy Act allows for the removal of the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU or EEA countries owning, managing or supervising a pharmacy in Ireland that is less than three years old — the derogation under Article 2.2 of Council Directive 85/433/EEC.  My motivation in providing for the removal of this derogation was to facilitate the many Irish pharmacy graduates who, because of the shortage of pharmacy undergraduate places available in the State, went abroad to train.  On their return these graduates found that they were at a disadvantage to their Irish trained colleagues in not being able to establish a new pharmacy business, having instead to confine themselves to ones which had already been in operation for at least 3 years, a situation that was clearly unfair and unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3429">The Pharmacy Act will be commenced in 3 stages.  The 1st Stage of the process has put in place the Council of the new Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the 2nd Stage will put in place a new Registration regime for pharmacists and pharmacies, including offences and powers of investigation and the 3rd Stage will deal with complaints, inquiries and discipline (Fitness to Practice Provisions).  A three stage process allows flexibility in implementation dates, given the complexity and number of new policies and procedures that the new PSI Council must have in place to accommodate each stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3430">In relation to the removal of the derogation, new policies and procedures must be in place before the second stage of implementation of the Act, including the removal of the derogation, can proceed.   The second stage of the implementation of the Act will deal with the new procedures for registration of pharmacists and pharmacy businesses under Part 4 of the Act, the conditions for conduct of a retail pharmacy business, including 3 years post-registration experience for supervising pharmacists, Part 7 of the Act on the investigation of alleged offences, breaches of codes or professional misconduct, regulations for supervision of the sale and supply of medicinal products and, in the interest of public safety, new conditions for registration of pharmacists in terms of forensic and linguistic competency.  Once these new policies and procedures and the new regulatory regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses, are put in place by the Council, it will be possible to revoke the 1962 Pharmacy Act and remove the derogation.</p>

         asked the

         the number of persons in possession of medical cards in respect of 1 January 2008 and the same day in each year back to 1998; and the proportion of the population this represents in each case.

            <p eId="para_3441">Details of the numbers of medical card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The table below shows the number of persons with medical cards and the proportion of the national population which this represents, on the dates requested by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3442">In interpreting this information, it is necessary to take account of the fact that the HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) has undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality in the General Medical Services (GMS) client database.  For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries, where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased.  This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual  number of persons who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.</p>

         asked the

          her views on the soft opt-out organ donation policy as adopted in Spain or Belgium as one move to combat low organ donation here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3513">There are two systems that can be used to ascertain an individual's wishes on organ donation: the opt-in system and the opt-out system.  The former system (which operates in this country) requires the specific consent of the donor or, where he or she is deceased, their relatives, before organs or tissues are removed.  The opt-out system presumes that all deceased persons consent to donation unless they have specifically expressed a wish to the contrary.  My Department is advised that even where opt-out/presumed consent systems are in operation such as in Spain, the relatives of the deceased may be approached as part of the donor screening process to seek a medical history of any high-risk behaviour.  In these circumstances the relatives can register an objection to the donation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3514">The practice in this country is that, even when a deceased person had indicated his or her willingness to donate organs, the consent of the next-of-kin is always sought.  There are differing views as to the appropriateness and effectiveness of a change to the existing arrangements covering the question of consent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3515">My Department is formulating proposals on human tissue legislation to meet the key recommendation of the Madden Report on Post Mortem Practice and Procedures.  The scope of the Bill will cover the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of human tissue from deceased persons, and related matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_3516">A Consultative Forum on the development of the legislative proposals was held in June 2007 followed by a public invitation for written submissions.  One of the matters that has been raised in this context is the issue of consent for the donation of tissue and organs for transplantation.  Discussions are ongoing with the major stakeholders on issues identified from the submissions.  It is expected that proposals will be submitted to Government in the first half of this year seeking approval to draft Heads of a Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3517">According to the 2007 Annual Report of the Organ Procurement Service, based in Beaumont Hospital, there were a total of 88 donors and this led to a total of 223 organs being transplanted.  This compares with a total of 187 transplants in 2003 when there were 86 donors.  The rate of organ donation in Ireland has traditionally been high by EU comparison.</p>

The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focused at present on the completion of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

            <p eId="para_3586">My Department uses the Public Appointments Service (PAS)  for open recruitment to all positions within the remit of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004.  Such recruitments are by means of open competition and are subject to the Codes of Practice of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA).  Persons with disabilities are entitled to compete in all open competitions.  The CPSA has published a code of Practice entitled "Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Public Service and Certain Public Bodies" which sets out the principles and standards to be applied in the recruitment and selection process of persons with disabilities.  The person referred to by the Deputy should contact PAS directly for further information.  Contact details are asfollows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3587">The Public Appointments Service, Chapter House,  26-30 Abbey Street Upper, Dublin 1. Phone: 01 8587400;E-mail: info@publicjobs.ie; Website www.publicjobs.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3588">My Department is fully committed to promoting and supporting people with disabilities in the workplace.  In 2007, the National Disability Authority (NDA), which has responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the 3% employment target, surveyed all public bodies, including my Department.  Based on an extrapolation of the returned survey results for 2006,  2.7% of the total number of employees in my Department had a disability.  The results refer solely to those staff who voluntarily participated in the survey.  No inferences can be made in relation to the disability status of those who did not respond.  According to the NDA, the data may be interpreted as the minimum proportion of staff with disabilities in an organisation.  The NDA is currently conducting a survey in respect of employment of persons with disabilities in all public bodies in 2007, which includes my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3589">From  2002 to date, there have been a number of individuals from outside the civil service who have held short term contracts or who have been seconded into the Department for their professional expertise.  In relation to the recruitment of staff, including those from outside the civil service, there is, understandably, no requirement on staff to declare if they have a disability.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to advise the Deputy of the number of staff recruited from outside the civil service who have a disability.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_3612">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) which, together with the earlier Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), are implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3613">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone is expected to amount to expenditure of over €500m in 2008.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_3614">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3615">With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) was introduced from 1st January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3616">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  In addition, transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3617">When I announced the new scheme in July of last year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was to be forwarded to my Office in November and December as part of the application process of the new scheme.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review was completed last month and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:</p>
            <p eId="para_3618">the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;</p>
            <p eId="para_3619">services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;</p>
            <p eId="para_3620">where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened on an ongoing basis over the coming years. My ambition is to put in place a service that will fully meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century. These recent decisions referred to have been taken to reflect the future optimal configuration of co-ordination centres whilst ensuring that the detailed technical knowledge and experience of the Coast Guard Watch Officers is retained and fully utilised. I want to restate again that no Officer will be forced to move or lose their job. The transition arrangements for new centres, including the functions to continue at Malin and Valentia, will be negotiated with staff to ensure there is no loss of expertise.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">I have forwarded to the Deputies copies of the Deloitte and Touche Report. This report has provided a backdrop to ongoing improvements and developments in the Coast Guard over the last 6 years. I have also forwarded copies of the submission to me on which recent decisions were based. I am arranging for both documents to be published on the Department's website <i>www.transport.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">I purposely outlined a long-term scenario to provide structure to negotiations, which are now taking place, on how best to implement this particular step in the modernisation of the Irish Coast Guard. I have given direction to the tendering process, where a Request for Tender is now in preparation, and given enough notice to enable difficulties to be identified and resolved before equipment has to be installed. I have made it clear that these discussions, which are underway, must take account of the safety needs of local communities, and ongoing improvement of the service to the public, and the concerns of individual staff members. As I indicated previously the proposed restructuring was raised at the relevant committees on which the relevant organisations that have an interest in search and rescue are represented.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">I also want to take this opportunity to make two general statements related to the issue. Firstly, I am concerned that there is confusion in the public mind between the work done in Co-Ordination centres and that undertaken by local volunteers. A significant element of ‘local knowledge' is from the local Coast Guard Coastal Units and lifeboat crews strategically positioned around our coast. Their local knowledge of tides, currents, bays and local historical incident locations is invaluable to the Watch Officers of the Coast Guard. I would like to put on record again my appreciation of the selfless voluntary efforts of the Coast Guard, RNLI lifeboat and Community Rescue Boat crews in rescuing those in trouble on our coasts, cliffs and offshore islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">Secondly, the Coast Guard restructuring that is being worked on is aimed at improving the efficiency of a key public service. The Deputies will be aware that subsequently, in his budget day announcement, the Tánaiste asked that each Department undertake an efficiency review of expenditure. The Review is specifically required to consider possible inefficiencies due to the multiplicity of Boards and Agencies; the need for better sharing of certain services, efficiencies in management, travel and consumables in general.  My Department is in the process of evaluating options and this includes examining the similarities in service provision in the Department and its agencies — particularly in the safety area — to consider whether there are duplicating or overlapping functions which could be more efficiently delivered through the amalgamation, abolition or reduction of bodies, or pooling services. The position in relation to Coast Guard services is being considered in that context and with the benefit of the many comments that I have received since the restructuring proposal was announced. I can assure the Deputies that all the views expressed will be taken into account before a west coast location is determined.</p>

         the number of Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas sponsored by his Department in each year from 2003 to 2007; the Acts which were legislation wholly or mainly required by Ireland’s EU obligations, which were partly so required, and which had no significant or minimal reference to EU legislation; and if in the first two cases Ireland had significant discretion, as to the manner in which EU obligations were translated into domestic law.

            <p eId="para_3732">The Railway Safety Act 2005 was enacted partly in order to fulfil Ireland's obligations to transpose the Railway Safety Directive 2004 (Directive 2004/49/EC of 29th April 2004) insofar as it established the regulatory and institutional framework for railway safety as required by the Directive.  As well as the usual discretion available in the implementation of EU directives to decide on the means of meeting the requirements, the Railway Safety Directive gave some latitude to Member States as to the scope of application of the Directive, i.e. as to whether it was applied to light rail as well as to conventional and heavy rail.</p>

            <p eId="para_3796">The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), which owns Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports, has overall borrowings of just under €500 million as at the end of 2007.  Just over €200 million of DAA's borrowings relates to Cork airport, almost €70 million relates to Shannon airport and the remainder relates to Dublin airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">Following recent disposals of Great Southern Hotels and DAA's interests in Birmingham and Hamburg Airports, DAA net debt levels have fallen sharply in the short term, resulting in a temporary net cash position at the end of 2007, before rising steadily again over the period referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3798">Precisely what DAA's debt levels will be over this period will depend upon a number of factors.  However, in the context of the DAA's Capital Investment programme over 10 years, DAA's debt position will rise substantially, with net borrowings increasing to over €1 billion over the course of the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3799">The future level of debt at Shannon and Cork will depend on a number of factors including, most significantly, the business plans for these airports which are currently being assessed by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3803">The examination of  the alleged continued use of vehicles which are written off by insurers has been progressing on two fronts. The first relates to the establishment of a framework going forward so that there is an effective system in place which ensures that all write off instances are notified and properly recorded. My Department has been informed of the initial deliberations of an informal review group established to examine this issue chaired by the RSA and representative of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda Síochána, and the National Vehicle and Driver File (NVDF). Further consultation with relevant stakeholders is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3804">The second task relates to obtaining details of vehicles which have been written off in recent years for comparison against the NVDF to seek to determine the extent to which written off vehicles may still be in circulation. At a recent meeting with the Irish Insurance Federation I sought and was given a commitment that they will use their influence with individual insurers to have the necessary data made available voluntarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_3805">The alleged importation of write offs from abroad is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners who are responsible for the registration of vehicles.</p>

            <p eId="para_3816">A number of measures relating to transport are included in the Climate Change Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These include rebalancing of motor taxes, Mineral Oil Tax Relief for biofuels, modal shift through Transport 21 and the achievement of a 5.75% biofuels blend in fuels by 2010.  In all, the transport sector will provide up to 13% in total national emission savings under that Strategy. Further details of the Strategy are available on the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government: www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3817">Ireland has a single target under the Kyoto Protocol and individual targets are not set for each sector.  The National Climate Change Strategy includes an estimate for the impact of rebalancing VRT and Motor Tax to reflect carbon dioxide emissions. An updated analysis, to reflect the actual measures announced in the last Budget, will be presented by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in the annual report on the implementation of the Strategy.  This annual report will also include updated projections of greenhouse gas emissions for all sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3818">In the meanwhile the Government is committed to delivering a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan this year and I plan to initiate an intensive public consultation process on the issues shortly.  I would expect that the question of emission targets for transport will be explored in more detail during that process.</p>

In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my reply in Dail Question number 90 of 1 November 2007 in the House in which I explained that, following correspondence with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the display on my Department's website of two registers, one of road haulage operator and another of licensed passenger transport operators, was not in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 2006 or with data protection rules generally. Both registers were removed from my website immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_3877">My Department regularly reviews its data security in the light of changing circumstances and needs.

            <p eId="para_3915">No civil or other public servants decentralised from my Department up to 31 December 2006. 44 civil servants from my Department transferred in 2007 to posts which were due to move out of Dublin under the Government's decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3916">410 public servant posts are also earmarked to decentralise in respect of the following four agencies — National Roads Authority (90) and Railway Safety Commission (20) to Ballinasloe, Irish Aviation Authority (100) to Shannon, and Bus Eireann (200) to Mitchelstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_3917">My recent decision to move the Maritime Safety Directorate and the Irish Coast Guard to Drogheda is likely to lead to an increase in the number of posts to be transferred there over and above the original 37 planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3918">Loughrea is the only decentralised location currently in operation. The above mentioned agencies were not identified by the Decentralisation Implementation  Group as early movers, and consequently, progress on their relocation is less advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3919">The values of properties purchased and sold in respect of the decentralisation process to date is a matter for the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_3920">The total non-capital expenditure incurred by my Department to date is €31,343 for travel and subsistence costs in respect of the move to Loughrea.</p>
            <p eId="para_3921">It is not possible to state the exact number of Departmental staff involved in the administration of the decentralisation process at any one time. In respect of the move of staff to Loughrea, for example, there would have been at least 10 staff involved at different levels at any particular stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_3934">I propose to take Questions Nos. 578 and 579 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3935">Most of Ireland's expenditure on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) is provided under Vote 29, International Cooperation. The programme is administered by the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid. The Government has provided a total allocation of €814 million to Vote 29 for 2008. This represents an increase of €84 million on the 2007 level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3936">A further estimated €100 million will be spent by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget. This will bring Ireland's total ODA contribution in 2008 to €914 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">Expenditure in 2008 will be the highest in the history of the programme representing 0.54 % of GNP. This level of spending will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most generous donors on a per capita basis. We are well on track to meeting the UN target of 0.7% by 2012, three years ahead of the EU commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3938">Ireland's Overseas Development Assistance comprises of both multilateral and bilateral contributions. Multilateral ODA consists of contributions channelled through multilateral and international organisations who conduct their activities in favour of development. Bilateral ODA consists of contributions made directly by Ireland to developing countries, including contributions made through NGOs, missionary organisations and other bilateral partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3939">Last year Ireland provided assistance to over eighty countries. However, Ireland places particular emphasis on long term support to eight programme countries: Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Lesotho, Timor-Leste and Vietnam. In 2007 an Embassy was opened in Malawi, which will become Ireland's ninth programme country. These countries are amongst the poorest in the world and Ireland's assistance to them is directed primarily to the social sectors of health, education and rural development in order to make a real difference to the lives of ordinary people.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_3941">Education is a key component of Ireland's overseas development aid programme. This focus was reiterated in the White Paper on Irish Aid in 2006 which states that ‘Education is the primary vehicle by which economically and socially marginalised adults and children can lift themselves out of poverty'. In 2007 Irish Aid, the Government's official aid programme, expended approximately €65 million on a range of education projects and programmes across the aid programme. Over the period 2000-2007 the total expenditure on education amounted to approximately €360 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3942">This level of expenditure reflects Ireland's commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal of achieving universal primary education by 2015 and the important contribution of education to poverty reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3943">Funding for education is delivered through a range of channels, including direct support to Ministries of Education, NGOs and missionaries as well as multilateral agencies and global initiatives. Support to education encompasses assistance which is designed to put in place sustainable education systems, through support for teacher training, provision of textbooks and teaching materials, school construction and the development of curricula. This enables Ministries of Education to provide quality education with a focus on child centred learning for the increasing numbers of children attending schools. The main focus is on primary education, including support for girl's education and strengthening the education sector response to HIV and AIDS. Support is also provided, where appropriate, to second and third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3944">Approximately two thirds of expenditure is allocated to partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zambia and South Africa. Over the past decade there has been encouraging progress in these countries with increased enrolments of primary school children. In Mozambique for example enrolments increased from 2.5 million in 2000 to over 4 million in 2006. In Ethiopia enrolments were 11.2 million in 2006 compared with 6.5 million in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3945">Irish Aid also supports Irish NGOs and missionaries for their education work in countries such as Afghanistan and Sierra Leone. In 2006 approximately €16 million was allocated to national and international NGOs for their work in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3946">In addition to the support provided directly at country level Irish Aid also funds global initiatives such as the Education for All Fast-Track Initiative and multilateral organisations including the World Bank, UNICEF and UNESCO. This enables Ireland to support the achievement of universal primary education in a greater number of low income countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3947">The Government recognises that sustainable improvements in education systems will require a long-term commitment of resources by national governments and by the international community. In the context of an expanded aid programme, Irish Aid is committed to providing assistance to education in a sustained and predictable manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_3949">Benazir Bhutto's assassination on 27 December, and the subsequent widespread violence, made clear the continuing fragile political and security situation in Pakistan. In condemning her killing, on 27 December, I exhorted the authorities to continue to ensure that Pakistan continues on the road back to democracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3950">Parliamentary elections in Pakistan have now been rescheduled for 18 February. All the major political parties, including the late Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and Nawaz Sharif's PML-N, have indicated that they will take part.</p>
            <p eId="para_3951">I very much welcome President Musharraf's promises during recent meetings in Brussels, London and Paris to hold "free, fair, transparent and peaceful" elections. He has pledged to provide details of polling stations and electoral rolls on the internet to prevent ghost stations and fraudulent votes, and has made a commitment that ballots would not be transferred to Islamabad but counted on the spot in the presence of the political parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3952">However, I would continue to have some concerns regarding the conditions for elections in Pakistan. In particular, the Pakistani authorities should remove without delay restrictions on the media and freedom of expression, and release all remaining political prisoners, including members of the judiciary, lawyers, journalists and human rights defenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3953">My EU colleagues and I continue to keep the situation in Pakistan under active review, most recently in discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January. In line with its long-term commitment to support democratisation in Pakistan, the EU will mount a full election observation mission to Pakistan, to which Ireland is contributing a number of observers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3954">Pakistan is a country of real strategic importance with which the EU is interested in further strengthening its relations. However, this can only be in the context of a restoration of accountable representative government, supported by the people of Pakistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3955">Equally, it will be vital for any new government, in seeking to restore stability and address the security situation in that country, to have the legitimacy and credibility provided by elections that the people can have faith in.</p>

            <p eId="para_3957">I remain deeply concerned by recent developments in Kenya, where up to 700 people have been killed and up to 250,000 displaced from their homes in the aftermath of the elections of 27 December. The situation had stabilised slightly since the initial unrest, but regrettably there have been further large-scale fatalities in recent days. The original violence was sparked by protests against the announcement of the re-election of Mr Mwai Kibaki as President following elections which the opposition, led by Mr Raila Odinga, allege were rigged.</p>
            <p eId="para_3958">A Panel of Eminent African Personalities, headed by former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, is currently attempting to mediate a political settlement between government and opposition. These efforts have made a good start, with President Kibaki and Mr. Odinga having their first face-to-face meeting since the election on 24 January in Nairobi and Mr. Annan reporting a positive discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3959">My EU colleagues and I discussed Kenya at the General Affairs and External Affairs Council in Brussels on 28 January. Council Conclusions were agreed on the way forward. These Conclusions stress the need for a political solution to the violence in Kenya, and call on all sides to give the necessary support to the mediation efforts of the Panel of Eminent African Personalities. They also stress that any solution must reflect the democratic will of the Kenyan people and that failure by Kenya's leaders to work seriously for a political resolution at this time is likely to have implications for future EU-Kenya relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3960">Senior officials from my Department have held meetings in relation to the situation with the Kenyan Ambassador in Dublin, and have conveyed to her the Government's serious concerns, including in regard to the situation of human rights defenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3961">The Department of Foreign Affairs has also updated its consular advice in light of the current situation and is advising against any non-essential travel to Kenya at present. This advice will obviously be kept under close review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3962">Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to Kenya. Since 2006, Irish Aid has provided just under €6 million in humanitarian funding for Kenya. In addition to this, Irish Aid has provided over €16 million in funding since 2006 to Irish, international and local NGOs, as well as missionaries, working in Kenya, including World Vision, Trócaire, and Concern.   Earlier this month, I announced an extra €1million in humanitarian funding for Kenya to be distributed through Irish NGOs there. I will continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>

         the number of Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas sponsored by his Department in each year from 2003 to 2007; the Acts which were legislation wholly or mainly required by Ireland’s EU obligations, which were partly so required, and which had no significant or minimal reference to EU legislation; and if in the first two cases Ireland had significant discretion, as to the manner in which EU obligations were translated into domestic law.

            <p eId="para_4001">There have been five Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas sponsored by my Department since 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4002">Diplomatic Relations and Immunities (Amendment) Act 2006</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">The Act was not wholly or partly required as a result of EU obligations and contains no significant reference to EU legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act 2006</p>
            <p eId="para_4005">The British-Irish Agreement Amendment Act 2006 is a short technical amendment to the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 establishing the North/South Implementation Bodies. The amending legislation was necessary to clarify, in the context of alterations to EU funding structures, the interpretation of certain terms used in the original Agreement and legislation establishing the Special EU Programmes Body. The Act gives domestic legal effect to an international agreement with the British Government entered into by an Exchange of Letters dated 25 July 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_4006">European Communities Act 2007</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">European Communities (Amendment) Act 2006</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">European Communities (Amendment) Act 2003</p>
            <p eId="para_4009">The European Communities (Amendment) Act 2003 was enacted to amend the European Communities Act 1972 in order to enable the State to ratify the Accession Treaty providing for ten new Member States to join the EU and to allow for the relevant parts of that Treaty to become part of the domestic law of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4010">Likewise, the European Communities (Amendment) Act 2006 amended the European Communities Act 1972 in order to enable the State to ratify the Accession Treaty providing for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU and to allow certain parts of that Treaty to become part of the domestic law of the State. Both of these Acts were required by Ireland's EU obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">The European Communities Act 2007 was enacted in order to address the issues which arose as a result of the findings of the Supreme Court in the Browne (Browne v A.G. and others [2003] 3 IR 205) and Kennedy (Kennedy v A.G. and others [2005] IESC 36) cases. Those cases related to the use by the State of secondary legislation as a mechanism for giving effect to European Community law and policy in domestic law. In those cases, the Supreme Court found that a statutory instrument to give effect to EC law can only be validly made where the Oireachtas has specifically provided for this in the relevant primary legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4012">The effect of the Browne and Kennedy judgments was that the State had to revise the manner in which EC law is implemented into domestic law by secondary legislation. The 2007 Act confirmed the validity of existing statutory instruments which were susceptible to legal challenge as a result of the Browne and Kennedy cases. In addition, the 2007 Act contains a provision which provides, in effect, that statutory instrument making powers contained in primary legislation may be used to implement EC measures provided that the legislation in question relates to those areas covered by the particular EC measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">The 2007 Act also provides Ministers with the power to create indictable offences by means of regulations made pursuant to the European Communities Act 1972, where a Minister considers it necessary for the purposes of implementing EC law (subject to certain restrictions). Until the enactment of the 2007 Act, regulations made under the 1972 Act were restricted to the creation of summary offences.</p>

            <p eId="para_4015">The case to which the Deputy refers was discussed in general terms in the course of my visit to Kosovo in November, 2007. My officials have since raised the case a number of times with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which retains responsibility for justice and policing matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4016">In response, UNMIK informed us that the individual in question was indicted on charges relating to his alleged role in demonstrations which took place in Pristina on 10 February 2007. They noted that he was released into house arrest on 7 July and that he was free to receive visitors. A panel of three international judges was appointed to hear the case: one subsequently excused himself due to other obligations and was replaced by a local Kosovo judge. A motion by the defendant to dismiss the original trial panel was dismissed by a local judge of the Pristina District Court. The trial began in Pristina District Court on 15 November, but was adjourned to 4 December to allow adequate preparation following the appointment of a new ex-officio Defence Counsel for the defendant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4017">On 19 December 2007, the presiding international judge terminated the individual's house arrest and ordered his immediate release. The next trial date has been set for today, 30 January. UNMIK have reiterated that there are no restrictions regarding the individual's contact with or access to lawyers or NGOs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4020">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4021">The process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) began in 2003, with between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants having been demobilized on completion of the process in 2007. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU's total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_4023">The Council further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the Council welcomed all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government's support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4024">My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement. Where such efforts have the support of the Colombian Government, Ireland very much welcomes the mediation of third parties in the pursuit of a solution to the conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_4025">A number of EU Member States, which have a history of involvement in the region, have been active in seeking to mediate between the Colombian Government and the left-wing guerrilla groups, efforts which are fully supported by Ireland and our EU partners. While, in discussions at EU level, we have not considered that current conditions call for UN involvement in the ending of terrorist activity in Colombia, Ireland would be supportive were the Colombian Government to request such intervention. Finally, Ireland, along with our EU partners, is appreciative of President Chavéz of Venezuela's recent successful efforts to secure the release of two hostages, an involvement which has also been recognised in recent statements on behalf of the Member States of the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_4027">The Government carefully monitors paramilitary and sectarian crime across Northern Ireland, including incidents of intimidation and harassment. All such activity, including so-called "punishment beatings", are cowardly criminal acts that have no place in a normal democratic society. The Government raises incidents of concern, including those arising in south Armagh, on an ongoing basis in our contacts with the relevant authorities, including through the framework of the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast. I discussed these issues with Secretary of State Shaun Woodward at our meeting in Dublin on 10 January.</p>
            <p eId="para_4028">The brutal murder of Paul Quinn was an appalling reminder of the bullying and intimidation which has blighted communities across Northern Ireland for too long. The murder is being actively investigated by An Garda Síochána, which is receiving excellent co-operation and assistance from the PSNI. I, as well as the Taoiseach and Cabinet colleagues, have met with the parents of the deceased young man. I conveyed to them the sympathy of the Government for their terrible loss and our determination to see justice done in this matter. I would again encourage anyone who has information on this murder to pass it on to the two police forces. It is only though full co-operation with the law enforcement agencies that the authors of this vicious crime will be brought to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4029">Nonetheless, the substantial achievements made in attaining full political support for the institutions of policing and criminal justice in Northern Ireland, and in building confidence in the police across the community are having a positive effect on the ground. The PSNI reports a 37% drop in casualties resulting from paramilitary style assaults during the year to 31 March 2007, to 48. The Independent Monitoring Commission, established by the two Governments in 2004, has recorded a similar reduction in assaults.</p>
            <p eId="para_4030">The Government will continue to work with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to encourage the continued development of community policing and the reduction of crimes such as bullying and harassment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4038">The situation in Zimbabwe remains grave. In addition to the economic hardships, there are continuing reports of brutal repression of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and other civil society groups perceived to be challenging the Zanu PF ruling party. There is a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation and violence towards those who seek change in the country. As economic hardships and political repression intensify, there is unfortunately no sign that the Zimbabwean government is willing to change the policies which have brought the country to its knees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4039">Ireland and the EU strongly believe that African leadership is the key to encouraging progress towards economic and political stability. We support the talks between the government and opposition in Zimbabwe which are being mediated by President Mbeki under a Southern African Development Community (SADC) mandate. The Taoiseach discussed the progress of this initiative with President Mbeki when they met in Pretoria on 15 January. The Taoiseach and Minister of State Kitt also attended the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December at which the EU's concerns regarding the current situation in Zimbabwe were clearly articulated by Chancellor Merkel and High Representative Solana on behalf of the Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">Implementation of any agreement reached will of course be crucial, and must bring about real policy change. The Zimbabwean people must have a chance to express their will without fear in the elections which have been announced for 29 March. Unfortunately, in the current environment we can have no confidence that Zimbabweans will have this chance. The appointment of an independent electoral commission, reform of the voter registration lists, the halting of political oppression and violence, and free media access would be important steps towards ensuring that these elections are free and fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">Ireland will continue to be active in relation to Zimbabwe, including condemning human rights abuses and urging political and economic reform. Our Embassy in Pretoria monitors allegations of human rights abuses in Zimbabwe, and raises issues of concern with the Zimbabwean government at every available opportunity. It is important to maintain pressure on the Zimbabwean Government to address the appalling human rights situation in that country and, in that regard, Ireland fully supported the renewal of the EU Common Position on Zimbabwe which was discussed in Brussels last week. I also very much welcome the strong interest in, and support for change in Zimbabwe, which exists in this House, as evidenced by the recent motion adopted on Zimbabwe in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_4042">Irish Aid continues to provide support to alleviate the sufferings of the Zimbabwean people, amounting to over €17 million in 2006 and 2007, and already in 2008 a further €1.1 million has been disbursed. Our contribution is channelled through UN agencies, local and international NGOs, and Irish missionaries. Ireland stands ready to respond appropriately to any positive change in Zimbabwe.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_4044">The Taoiseach visited South Africa and Tanzania from 13 to 18 January. He was accompanied by the Minister for Trade and Enterprise, Michéal Martin, T.D. and the Minister of State for Overseas Aid, Michael Kitt, T.D.</p>
            <p eId="para_4045">The key objectives of the visit were to further develop Irish–South African bilateral and trade relations, and to visit Irish Aid funded development projects and programmes in South Africa and Tanzania.</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">In South Africa, the Taoiseach had meetings with President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngucka, where discussions focused on political, trade and development issues. The Taoiseach was accompanied by a large trade delegation, with over fifty companies taking part, including from Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach carried out a series of trade-related engagements organised in conjunction with IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland, with the aim of developing the presence of Irish companies in South Africa through trade, investment, partnerships and other business linkages.</p>
            <p eId="para_4047">The Taoiseach visited a number of development aid projects supported by the Government through Irish Aid. Ireland has been providing bilateral assistance to South Africa since the transition from apartheid to a democratic, non-racial Government in 1994. In December 2007 Irish Aid finalised a 5 year programme to provide bilateral assistance of over €65 million to South Africa from 2008 to 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4048">In Cape Town the Taoiseach visited the Niall Mellon Township Trust where he announced funding of €5 million to support the Trust in the provision of housing. He also announced the official launch of Chello, a charity working on educational scholarships for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. The Taoiseach visited the offices of Eurocape, where the Mandela Rhodes Place development is viewed as a flagship inner city rejuvenation project. The Taoiseach also visited Leratong Hospice, founded by Fr. Kieran Creagh from Belfast, which is being supported by Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4049">In Tanzania, the Taoiseach was accompanied by the Minister for Overseas Development, Mr Michael Kitt, T.D.</p>
            <p eId="para_4050">The Taoiseach held meetings with President Kikwete and senior Government ministers. Discussions focused on political and developments issues. Tanzania is one of nine priority countries supported by Ireland's development programme. Irish Aid expects to provide direct bilateral assistance of approximately €170 million in the current programme period to 2010. This includes support for health, HIV/AIDS activities, agriculture, local government and good governance. Additional assistance will be channelled through NGOs, missionaries and international partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4051">In Dar-es-Salaam the Taoiseach visited a disability facility run by the Comprehensive Community Based Rehabilitation Treatment (CCBRT), a non-governmental organisation which provides services for a wide variety of eye, orthopaedic and other conditions, and for which he announced funding of €1.3 million over three years. The Taoiseach also announced funding of €400,000 to support a programme of surgical training in ten countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including Tanzania. This training will be implemented in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI). He also visited a public hospital and a water point, funded by Irish Aid, in partnership with the Government of Tanzania, which provides clean water for a community of 15,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">The Taoiseach travelled to Mwanza, in northwest Tanzania, where he met local people and community leaders working in farming and private enterprise. He visited a school and a women's centre which provides support for victims of gender-based violence. He also met Irish missionaries working in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">The Taoiseach's visit to South Africa and Tanzania has made an important contribution to enhancing Ireland's bilateral relations and to promoting trade with those countries. It also provided an important opportunity to see at first hand the positive impact of the work of Ireland's aid programme on the lives of ordinary people and to reaffirm Ireland's commitment to working in partnership with developing countries to reduce poverty in a real and lasting way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4055">Heavy rains and storms since the beginning of December 2007 have caused severe flooding in southern Africa, including Zambia. A UN Preliminary Emergency Appeal for the region has been issued and a Revised Emergency Appeal, providing a more detailed operational plan will be completed shortly. World Food Programme (WFP) staff are currently on the ground, carrying out this assessment. Good preparations have been made by the Zambian Government in advance of the flooding and to date some of the worst effects have been mitigated. However much depends on the extent of future rainfall.</p>
            <p eId="para_4056">Once the assessment is completed funding is expected to be released from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland is a key donor to the CERF, which was established specifically to facilitate rapid response to emergencies such as that affecting southern Africa, including Zambia, at the moment. Ireland has contributed approximately €30 million to the CERF and will provide further funding shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4057">Zambia is one of Ireland's priority countries for development assistance. The budget allocation for 2008 is €27 million. These funds are delivered across a range of sectors including, HIV/Aids, education, governance and civil society. Our Embassy in Lusaka is monitoring the situation on the ground carefully and we remain prepared to continue to respond as the situation unfolds.</p>

            <p eId="para_4059">The Department of Foreign Affairs implements a range of security measures, including multi-layered firewalls, to secure its internal ICT network from the Internet.

            <p eId="para_4063">The Government attributes the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States. I have also made it a personal priority as Minister, and will continue to do so. The passage of the agreed Motion by the Dáil on 7 November sent an important and timely message of solidarity from all parties of the House to our undocumented community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4064">Following the failure of the US Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation last June, despite the strong endorsement and encouragement of President Bush, the Government immediately set about exploring with key US Administration and Congressional contacts possible alternative bilateral options. In addition, since the all-party motion was passed, the Taoiseach had a detailed telephone call with Senator Edward Kennedy on 7 December, in which he again reiterated the Government's strong support for a bilateral solution. At a meeting with the US Ambassador later the same month, I forcefully made the same point. Likewise, the Ambassador and his Embassy colleagues in Washington are in ongoing discussions with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures, including Senators Kennedy and Schumer, on possible ways forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_4065">Achieving progress on immigration at this time, in the middle of a Presidential campaign, is exceptionally difficult. Our many friends in Congress have emphasised this, including the difficulty of passing legislation specifically for our citizens separate from the other 11 million undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_4066">Despite these considerable political difficulties, the Government is determined to make every effort to succeed. The Taoiseach will again be pursuing our case very actively at the highest level on his visit to the U.S. over the St. Patrick's Day period, as will the Ambassador and his colleagues on an ongoing basis on the ground in Washington.</p>

            <p eId="para_4085">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4086">The process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) began in 2003, with between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants having been demobilized on completion of the process in 2007. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_4087">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 19 November 2007. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which expressed the EU's total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_4088">The Council further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the Council welcomed all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government's support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4089">In this regard, Ireland, along with our EU partners, very much welcomes recent initiatives to pursue negotiations with the FARC for the purpose of securing the release of hostages and bringing an end to the internal armed conflict. These include the establishment of a demilitarised zone, with international observers, from which hostages could be safely released. The Catholic Church in Colombia has been requested to act as a mediator between the Government and the FARC in pursuing this proposal. Colombia has also endorsed a facilitation role proposed by France, Spain and Switzerland, which has the full support of Ireland and our EU partners. In addition, the establishment of an international medical mission to visit and assist those currently held hostage by the FARC has been suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4090">The EU has expressed its support for the Colombian Government's policies aimed at ensuring the rule of law, legality, security of persons and human rights. The EU has also condemned systematic breaches of the most fundamental human rights, including the right to life and to liberty, perpetrated by all terrorist groups in Colombia. The willingness of EU Member States, including Ireland, to assist the Colombian authorities in their pursuit of peace was most recently expressed on behalf of Member States in a meeting between the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Secretary General of the Council of the European Union, Mr. Javier Solana, and the President of Colombia, Mr. Álvaro Uribe, on 22 January, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4091">My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement.</p>

            <p eId="para_4096">The body of the person mentioned by the Deputy was found on 29 August 2006 in Mallorca, lying in shallow water close to the shoreline. The local autopsy report stated that she had committed suicide by drowning. The report also indicated that there had been extensive injuries to her body, but suggested that these had occurred after her death. Her family strongly rejected any possibility of suicide and believed that she was the victim of foul play.</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">My Department at the time was in regular contact with her family and their solicitors, and provided all possible consular assistance. This included providing assistance in repatriating the remains, in obtaining copies of the autopsy report and post-mortem photographs, and in having the report translated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">In September 2007, the family informed the Department that a second autopsy, carried out by the State pathologist here, uncovered marks on the person's body that place the original verdict of suicide in doubt. Her family also indicated that they had retained the services of a lawyer in Spain to have her case reopened and that, once court dates, etc were available, they would be in further contact.</p>
            <p eId="para_4099">The Department and the Embassy in Madrid remain ready to help the family in every possible way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4110">The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Government fully supports the leadership of the UN Secretary General in this important work, and we welcome the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General's Special Representative to Cyprus, Mr. Michael Moeller, to bring the two sides together to seek progress toward a political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">On 8 July 2006, the UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, brokered an agreement between the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, and Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, representing the Turkish Cypriot community, on a set of principles, recognising that the status quo was unacceptable and that a comprehensive settlement was both desirable and possible. They agreed to begin immediately a two-track process involving discussions by committees of issues affecting the day-to-day life of the people and, concurrently, of substantive issues leading to a comprehensive settlement. However, these committees were not subsequently established, due to disagreements on their respective mandates and terms of reference. Following a hiatus, consultations at official level on these issues resumed at the end of January 2007, though so far without any breakthrough.</p>
            <p eId="para_4112">On 5 September 2007, the Special Representative facilitated a meeting between President Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat, the first such encounter between the two leaders since 2006. While regrettably no substantive progress was made on this occasion, we welcome the reopening of political dialogue which this meeting represented. Both sides have since sent submissions to the UN Secretary General, outlining new proposals to take the process forward. The Secretary General has not formally commented on these proposals as yet. We remain hopeful that this dialogue under the auspices of the UN may yet help to unblock the stalemate in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">Ireland takes an active interest in the successful resolution of the Cyprus issue. We maintain close contact with the Cypriot and Turkish Governments through both the Embassies of Cyprus and Turkey in Dublin, and through our Embassies in Nicosia and Ankara. Officials from my Department have also met with the Office of the Secretary-General's Representative to Cyprus, most recently in December, to receive an update on the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">We will continue to encourage both sides to renew their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of the objective of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic interests and aspirations of all. I have made our position clear to successive Cypriot colleagues, and also to Turkish Ministers for Foreign Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4126">My Department is fully committed to the employment of persons with disabilities where possible and is fully aware of the requirements of the Disability Act of 2005 in this regard. The Deputy will appreciate, however, that the compilation of compliance statistics in this area is a sensitive issue. It depends to a large extent on the voluntary self-disclosure of a disability by a member of staff. Many people with disabilities, however, are reluctant to disclose the extent of their disability. Still others do not regard themselves as having a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4127">Nevertheless, I am satisfied with the ongoing efforts of the Department to encourage and facilitate the recruitment of people with disabilities. The current estimate of the proportion of staff with a disability in this Department is 3%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">The Public Appointments Service (PAS) is responsible for recruitment across the Civil Service, including the recruitment of people with disabilities. My Department works with other Government Departments, the PAS and the National Disability Authority in the implementation of the provisions of the Disability Act 2005, including those relating to the recruitment and employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. This Department also participates in the confined promotion competitions for people with disabilities who are already in the Civil Service, which are organised by the PAS from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">There is, of course, scope for further progress in this area. My Department has continued to enhance its efforts to employ and accommodate people with special needs who can otherwise satisfy the conditions of employment. For example, the Department participated in the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) programme in 2006 and 2007. The purpose of this programme was to provide work experience opportunities for graduates with disabilities in the Civil Service. A placement was offered in each of these years.</p>

            <p eId="para_4132">I propose to take Questions Nos. 609 and 611 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. In November 2004, following recommendations from the Government's Implementation Committee, the Department was included in the first phase of moves under the decentralisation programme, with a projected timeframe of the first quarter of 2007 for the move.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">In Autumn 2004, the Department set up a dedicated decentralisation unit as part of the Corporate Services Division to handle the administration of the decentralisation programme particularly from a staffing perspective. This unit liaises with the staff in Irish Aid assigned to handle the logistics of the decentralisation programme. The staffing levels between these two units have varied from a high of 5 full time officers to the current level of 3 officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">Good progress has been made to date, and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised. An advance party involving 56 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick, with most officers being in place since May 2007. It is expected that the remaining staff of Irish Aid will transfer to Limerick in June 2008 on completion and fit-out of the permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">According to the latest figures available to the Department, 134 Dublin-based officers of this Department have applied to decentralise. Twenty-eight of these applied to decentralise with this Department to Limerick and 18 of these are have already transferred to this location. One hundred and six officers applied to transfer with other Departments to their decentralising locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">Twenty-four Dublin based-officers of this Department have transferred to other Departments with a view to moving to a provincial location under the Decentralisation Programme. Fourteen of these officers initially transferred to Dublin-based offices of the respective decentralising Departments and 10 transferred directly to a provincial location.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">In regard to planning permissions and costs relating to premises, both the interim offices in O'Connell Street and the permanent accommodation in Henry Street Limerick have been provided for the Department by the Office of Public Works (OPW).</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">The ancillary costs associated specifically with decentralisation have been paid for out of the Department's normal administrative budget. They include: €195,000 initial set-up spending on items such as the purchase of IT equipment and office machinery, additional telecommunications costs for interim premises; €15,000 decentralisation training allowance paid to 5 officers required to transfer from a provincial location to Dublin for training, for a period of up to 8 weeks each, prior to relocating to Limerick. Further costs in relation to the decentralisation training allowance will be kept to a minimum and are not expected to exceed €45,000; An estimated €113,000 on the cost of two additional ICT help desk engineers based in the interim premises in Limerick from May 2007 to June 2008. Following the permanent move, these costs will be in the region of €56,000 annually; and Approximately €213,000 on the forthcoming ICT fit-out of the permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4140">Additional communication costs (including line rental) between Irish Aid in Limerick and the rest of the Department are estimated at €55,000 per annum</p>
            <p eId="para_4141">This Department has no other decentralised locations and no agencies due to decentralise.</p>

            <p eId="para_4143">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Development Cooperation Directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is Irish Aid's Headquarters, will decentralise to Limerick. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">An advance party involving 56 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick. It is expected that the remaining staff of Irish Aid will transfer to Limerick in June 2008, on completion and fit-out of the permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">Fifty of the officers who have already transferred to Limerick were Dublin-based applicants and the remaining 6 were from provincial locations. Of the remaining 47 staff already identified for Limerick, 15 are currently based in provincial locations and 32 are Dublin-based applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">Twenty-four Dublin based-officers of this Department have transferred to other Departments with a view to moving to a provincial location under the Decentralisation Programme. Fourteen of these officers initially transferred to Dublin-based offices of the respective decentralising Departments and 10 transferred directly to a provincial location.</p>
            <p eId="para_4147">In addition, 2 officers, based in the Passport Office Cork, transferred directly to their chosen decentralised location.</p>
            <p eId="para_4148">Additional staff may transfer to other decentralised or decentralising locations with other Departments throughout 2008. The total of these additional staff is difficult to quantify as the timing of such moves is dependent in the first instance on the other Department.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4150">The Research Framework Programmes are the EU's main instrument for funding research in Europe and have been operating successfully since 1984. They have played a particularly important role in bringing European researchers (in academia and in industry) together in collaborative research projects, in facilitating the mobility of researchers across Europe and in supporting economic and social development. Irish participation in the Framework Programmes over the last 20 years has provided essential funding and collaborations, which have fostered the growth and development of the Irish research base.</p>
            <p eId="para_4151">Ireland participated actively in the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6), which spanned the period 2003 to 2006 with a budget of approx €17 billion, and Irish researchers and companies have been successful in securing approximately €210 million from FP6.</p>
            <p eId="para_4152">The current Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has a budget of over €50 billion, covering the seven-year period 2007 to 2013 and it has been designed to build 	on the achievements of its predecessor towards the creation of the European Research Area and carry it further towards the development of the knowledge economy and society in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_4153">In order to extract the maximum benefit from the opportunities available within FP7, a new National Support Network has been put in place, headed up by a National Director for FP7 who leads a team based in Enterprise Ireland. This new support structure ensures that a coordinated and coherent approach is adopted towards FP7 across all of the government departments, agencies and other organisations involved. Through this support structure, a mix of guidance, advice and financial assistance is available to encourage researchers and enterprises, where appropriate, to avail of the opportunities within the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4154">The range of financial supports available to potential participants include:  Travel Support, assisting researchers to meet with potential partners, and Proposal Preparation Support for Academic Coordinators and Companies, covering all costs associated with submission of FP7 applications. To date Enterprise Ireland has provided €1.155 million in financial support to academic researchers and indigenous companies.  This amount, provided in the first year of FP7, exceeds the total of such support provided in the whole of the previous programme (2002-2006) and shows a high level of FP7 activity among potential participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4155">In November 2007, the Cabinet Committee on Science Technology and Innovation agreed that the total share of EU funding to be targeted by Ireland over the lifetime of FP7 should be in the region of €600 million.  This target is considered to be realistic yet sufficiently challenging.  It takes into account the potential for Irish participation in different parts of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4156">As regards details on successful applications, the Commission rules prevent the release of data on the funding secured by individual participants.  However, the first calls for proposals under FP7 were issued at the beginning of 2007 and the Commission has provided some preliminary statistics on success rates (the share of proposals received that have been "retained for funding").  In this regard, Irish researchers (academic and industry) are associated with 133 proposals retained for funding.  The Irish success rate (133 out of 591 proposals submitted with Irish involvement or 22.5%) is ahead of the overall average for all countries (19.6%) and this is a positive indication of the prospects for Irish participation in FP7 generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_4157">A more complete analysis of Irish participation in the first FP7 calls will be produced later in 2008 once official statistics relating to "signed contracts" are released by the European Commission.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4163">I propose to take Questions Nos. 614 and 615 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4164">I can advise the Deputy that it is my understanding that an au pair arrangement is essentially a private arrangement, normally agreed between a private household and a private individual.  As far as my Department is aware the term "au pair" has no legal standing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4165">In practice, the person referred to loosely as an "au pair" is often a student from another country, received and maintained by a family in exchange for certain informal services, such as a limited amount of house-work or child-minding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4166">Although circumstances can differ from case to case, an "au pair" is assumed not to be an employee because there is no contract of employment between the householder and the person in question.  If a contract of employment does exist, then this places the arrangement on a different footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4167">If an Irish resident seeks to bring into the State a person from outside the European Economic Area on the basis that the person coming in is an "au pair", they will probably have to discuss the matter with the immigration authorities under the auspices of the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_4168">It is my understanding that, if an EU national wishes to move in with a family in Ireland and provide child-minding services in return for, say, practice in speaking English and possibly a sum of money, they are quite free to do so.  The arrangement is private to the parties concerned and entirely voluntary on the basis of a shared understanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4169">If the "au pair" or the host family does not like the arrangement, generally, they are free to terminate it without recourse to the State.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_956">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4171">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">In April 2000 the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment introduced capped limits on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3 years total time on CE from 3rd April, 2000 — participation on CE before this date is disregarded).  CE Capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, avail of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4173">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_4174">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_4175">It should also be noted that FÁS and Local Employment Service Offices are available to provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available to those exiting CE.</p>
            <p eId="para_4176">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4178">Neither my Department nor its agencies are responsible for registering people as self-employed. Persons wishing to register as self-employed should file their records with the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes and the Department of Social and Family Affairs for social insurance matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4179">While FÁS runs courses for the training, assessment and certification of construction operatives as well as health and safety awareness instruction in this area, these courses are designed to focus on practical skills. However FÁS also offers more general training courses designed for those who have an interest in setting up their own business.  The courses contain a number of specific modules including instruction on legislative responsibilities for the self-employed regarding taxation and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).</p>
            <p eId="para_4180">The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners and sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits. Accordingly the question of random selection does not arise. A copy of the agreement is available on the website of the Labour Court: http://www.labourcourt.ie</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4182">Entrepreneurship in Ireland is supported and encouraged by the active and constant pursuit and promotion by the Government of an economic environment that is supportive of entrepreneurial activity combined with a wide range of targeted interventions by various State enterprise development agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">Ireland's extraordinary success over the past decade has been built on, and continues to be built on, such key competitive strengths as: having one of the lowest taxation regimes in Europe; access to the EU's Internal Market; a well-educated and skilled workforce and a history of pursuing Government policies that are pro-business and provide a benign business environment. The Government is committed to the continued support and development of these strengths.</p>
            <p eId="para_4184">The critical role of entrepreneurship is fully recognised by the Government and it is clear that the actions currently being taken are achieving the objective of ensuring that we have an entrepreneurial society. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Report for 2006, which is the premier cross-national assessment of entrepreneurship, shows that Ireland is performing extremely well in terms of entrepreneurship activity. In fact, Ireland is in third position, in terms of ‘Total Early Stage Entrepreneurial Activity' amongst EU Member States and seventh position overall within the OECD.</p>
            <p eId="para_4185">The Small Business Forum Report placed a particular importance on this topic and recommended that the Government should formally adopt a National Entrepreneurship Policy Statement focused on optimising the number of start-up businesses, and in particular, on maximising the number of start-ups aspiring to, and achieving high growth. The Forum also recommended that this Policy Statement should build upon three specific platforms: Stimulating latent entrepreneurial potential, particularly among women and the immigrant community; Reinforcing entrepreneurship in the education system; and Enhancing the culture for entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4186">On the 23 October 2007, Forfás published its report "Towards Developing an Entrepreneurship Policy for Ireland".  In parallel to this report, Forfás also published a Report entitled: "Mapping of Entrepreneurship Initiatives". This comprehensive Report sets out in detail the various initiatives in place across all Government Departments and Agencies in relation to entrepreneurial activities in Ireland. The above two Reports are available at www.forfas.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4187">In relation to support structures currently in place, the role of the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4188">The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4189">In addition to the Boards' normal activities, my Department funded a number of specific initiatives in 2007 where a need was identified for targeted actions, including the Tech-Check Programme whereby small businesses can apply to their local CEB for an assessment of their business's current technology usage, and receive a clear, action orientated and realistic strategy aimed at developing and deploying appropriate ICT skills with the objective of delivering real and sustainable competitive advantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_4190">Additional funding was also allocated in the area of Enterprise Education for the promotion and development of Entrepreneurial Awareness at local level in schools and colleges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4191">The CEBs also continued to promote Women in Business Training/Mentoring Programmes designed to provide potential women entrepreneurs with support systems to enhance their self-confidence and actively encourage their participation in greater numbers in new business generation, as well as, the CEB Regional and National Awards Programme aimed at promoting a greater awareness of the achievements of CEB-supported micro-enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_4192">In 2008, the Capital allocation for the 35 CEBs stands at over €20m.  This will enable the Boards to continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development regionally and nationally. This will be done, not just by direct grant-aid to businesses and project promoters, but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4193">I am satisfied that the above policy initiatives and support structures will maintain and further improve the environment in which entrepreneurship in general can thrive throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_4195">The role of the CEB Central Co-ordination Unit has its origins in one of the core recommendations of the Fitzpatrick's Review of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs). It recommended that a CEB Central Co-Ordination Unit (CCU) should be established within Enterprise Ireland (EI). The recommendation envisaged that the establishment of such a Unit could provide a level and range of supports to the CEBs which would ultimately enhance their effectiveness and impact on the development of micro-enterprise in Ireland. It also anticipated that in establishing the Unit within EI it could assist in providing as cohesive a structure as possible for the support of all indigenous enterprise and could facilitate a better exchange of experience and expertise between EI and CEBs particularly in relation to the identification of high potential start up (HPSUs).</p>
            <p eId="para_4196">This recommendation was approved by Government and subsequently endorsed by both the Enterprise Strategy Group Report and the Small Business Forum Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4197">Following a period of discussion and consultation between the CEBs, the Department and Enterprise Ireland the CCU was set up in Shannon in mid-2007. A wide range of strategic, administrative, financial and technical support functions in respect of the CEBs is now being delivered by Enterprise Ireland, through the CCU, including the allocation of individual CEB budgets and the processing of CEB budget requests, and the Unit is the first "port of call" for CEBs in relation to all operational matters.  The functions were transferred from the Department to the CCU on a gradual basis up to the end of December 2007. The CCU will also work closely with the Department in relation to the future development of strategies and policies concerning the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland and the role of the CEBs in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4379">The Construction Industry (Pension Assurance and Sick Pay) Registered Employment Agreement (REA) requires employers in the construction sector to become and remain a party to a contributory pension scheme approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  It also sets out the conditions upon which pension and mortality payments are payable and the associated minimum amounts and benefits.  The REA does not specify any particular pension scheme to apply but rather sets out the general criteria within which any such scheme should operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4380">The Construction Federation Operatives Pension Scheme (generally referred to as CFOPS) has been established on foot of the Registered Employment Agreement.  While it is not a legal requirement for employers and employees in the construction industry to pay into this particular scheme, it is, as already mentioned, a legal requirement that employers provide for pension, mortality and sick benefits for those workers to whom the REA applies. The conditions upon which such pension, mortality and sick pay benefits are payable and the amounts thereof must not be less favourable than those which are set out in the REA.</p>
            <p eId="para_4381">Enforcement of the provisions of a Registered Employment Agreement may be effected by direct complaint to the Labour Court.  A trade union may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a Registered Employment Agreement.  If, after investigating a complaint, the Court is satisfied that an employer is in breach of a Registered Employment Agreement the Court may by order direct compliance with the agreement.  Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine. These safeguards are in place to ensure the satisfactory operation of the pension schemes.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4384">I propose to take Questions Nos. 623 and 624 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4385">I assume the Deputy's first question refers to Registered Employment Agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4386">Registered Employment Agreements (REAs)</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 provides that an Employment Agreement is an agreement made either between a trade union and an employer or employer's organisation or at a meeting of a registered Joint Industrial Council, which relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers.  Section 27 of that Act provides that any party to an employment agreement may apply to the Labour Court to have an agreement registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">Where the Labour Court is satisfied that the agreement presented satisfies the statutory requirements, it registers the agreement. The effect of this is to make the provisions of the agreement legally enforceable in respect of every worker of the class, type or group to which it is expressed to apply and to his or her employer, even if such worker or employer is not a party to the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4389">Joint Labour Committees (JLCs)</p>
            <p eId="para_4390">When a JLC agrees terms and conditions, it makes proposals to the Labour Court.  That Court, on foot of a JLC proposal, can make Employment Regulation Orders (EROs).  EROs are statutory instruments which set out terms and conditions applying to specified workers in a particular sector.   Employers are then bound under penalty to pay wage rates and provide conditions of employment not less favourable than those prescribed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">Section 33 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that the Labour Court may at any time, on the application of any person, give its decision on any question as to the interpretation of a registered employment agreement or its application to a particular person.</p>
            <p eId="para_4392">Similarly, Section 57 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 provides that the Labour Court may at any time, on the application of any person, give its decision on the question whether a particular joint labour committee operates as respects a particular person or whether a particular employment regulation order applies to a particular person.</p>
            <p eId="para_4393">Therefore, it is open to any person to clarify the applicability of these Orders and Agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4394">The Deputy may be interested to note that a definition of "worker" is provided in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 as follows: "worker" means any person aged 15 years or more who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer, whether the contract be for manual labour, clerical work or otherwise, whether it be expressed or implied, oral or in writing, and whether it be a contract of service or of apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work or labour . . .' The meaning of the terms "worker" was considered by the High Court in Building and Allied Trades Union and Valentine Scott v The Labour Court and the Construction Industry Federation and Gerry Fleming. In that case, which related to the Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Industry, Murphy J interpreted the term "worker" as including a subcontractor providing services personally under a contract of service.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4396">In relation to competition law, the precise term "inter-state trade" does not appear either in the Competition Act 2002 or in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Rome. However, the term "trade between Member States" appears in both Articles 81 and 82.</p>
            <p eId="para_4397">Article 81(1) prohibits agreements, decisions and concerted practices which "may affect trade between Member States" and which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in the common market.  However, agreements, decisions or concerted practices which contribute to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, may be exempted from this prohibition if the criteria set out in Article 81(3) is met.</p>
            <p eId="para_4398">Article 82 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position within the common market "in so far as it may affect trade between Member States."</p>
            <p eId="para_4399">In the context of those two articles, the term "trade between Member States" refers to trade between Member States of the European Union. Thus, anti-competitive agreements, decisions or restricted practices occurring in Ireland would be prohibited under this Article if they were capable of having an effect on trade between any of the Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_4400">Breach of Articles 81 and 82 is an offence, punishable under Irish competition law by fines of up to €4m or 10% of turnover and also by imprisonment for a term of up to five years in respect of breach of Article 81.</p>
            <p eId="para_4401">The term "inter-state trade" does not feature in domestic or EU company law.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4403">The operation of employment agencies in the State is regulated by the Employment Agency Act 1971 and Regulations made under it. Under this legislation an employment agency that has premises in the State is required to have an employment agency licence in order to operate in the State. In order to obtain such a licence, the premises of an employment agency must conform to prescribed standards of accommodation in relation to access and egress, cleanliness and tidiness, heating, lighting, ventilation, privacy, seating and safety and these standards must be certified by the applicant for an employment agency licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4404">In addition the applicant for an employment agency licence must be, in the opinion of the Minister, a person of good character and repute. This is verified by my Department by the receipt of references from two independent persons vouching for the character of the applicant and by a report from the Garda Síochána as to the character of the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4405">An employment agency licence covers a period of one year and is renewable on a yearly basis. Each yearly application for an employment agency licence must be accompanied by a fee of €500.</p>
            <p eId="para_4406">I would add that it is a contravention of the 1971 Act for an employment agency with premises in the State to operate in the State without an employment agency licence or to charge a job seeker a fee for seeking employment for him or her. A person who contravenes the Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,000 and to a further fine not exceeding €1,000 in respect of each day on which the offence is continued.</p>
            <p eId="para_4407">The Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, contains a commitment to introduce new legislation in this area and work is continuing on the development of proposals in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4409">Employment agencies in Ireland are licensed under the terms of the Employment Agency Act 1971. Under the terms of the Employment Agency Act 1971, which regulates the operation of employment agencies in the State, it is not an offence for an employment agency to advertise jobs which do not exist or are not yet available. My Department's understanding is that the aim of such advertising could be to attract potential candidates and an agency would then be in a position to invite interest from potential employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4410">Any specific complaints about agencies made to my Department are followed up in the normal way. The Labour Inspectorate (now the National Employment Rights Authority) has responsibility for the enforcement of employment rights arising from a range of employment rights legislation. Inspectors would pursue allegations of worker mistreatment — whether employed through agencies or otherwise — and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</p>

            <p eId="para_4414">Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) are established by order of the Labour Court under Section 35 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  JLCs discuss and agree terms and conditions to apply to specified workers in certain sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_4416">JLCs are made up of equal numbers of employer and worker representatives appointed by the Labour Court and a chairman appointed by the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4418">Section 25 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 provides that an Employment Agreement is an agreement made either between a trade union and an employer or employer's organisation or at a meeting of a registered Joint Industrial Council, which relates to the pay or conditions of employment of any class, type or group of workers.

I am not aware of any Court decision which has established that JLCs/REAs are incompatible with competition legislation.  As the Deputy is also aware, a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 is currently underway and in the course of that review, all submissions, including the matters raised in the Deputy's questions, will be considered.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4555">The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 provides, with effect from 1st March 1998, for a maximum average working week of 48 hours, averaged generally over 4 months. In addition the 1997 Act provides, with effect from 30th September 1997, for a right for an employee to nine public holidays a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4556">The 1997 Act also sets out certain minima with regard to annual leave e.g. for the leave year commencing 1st April 1999 and subsequent leave years:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4557">(a)4 working weeks in a leave year in which he the employee works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment), or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4558">(b)one-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which the employee works at least 117 hours, or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4559">(c)8 per cent of the hours an employee works in a leave year (but subject to a maximum of 4 working weeks).</p>
            <p eId="para_4560">Prior to the enactment of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 there was no statutory maximum average working week but 9 public holidays and maximum annual leave of 3 working weeks was provided for in the Holidays (Employees) Act 1973 which was repealed by the 1997 Act with effect from 30th September 1997. Under the 1973 Act my Department enforced employees' rights in the courts but the Statute of Limitations provides that such legal proceedings must be instituted within 6 years of the date of contravention of the 1973 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4561">If an employee does not receive his or her statutory rights from his or her employer in relation to the above matters under the 1997 Act it is open to him or her to refer his or her case to a Rights Commissioner for redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_4562">However, under the 1997 Act referral to a Rights Commissioner must take place within a maximum period of 18 months from the date of contravention of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4563">Therefore, it would appear that the person referred to by the Deputy is statute barred from pursuing a case under the Holidays (Employees) Act 1973 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_4564">Regarding unfair dismissal, The Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 protect employees from being unfairly dismissed by laying down criteria by which dismissals are judged to be unfair and by providing an adjudication system and redress for an employee whose dismissal was found to be unfair. A claim for redress under the Acts may be submitted initially to either of the adjudicative bodies specified in the Acts i.e. a Rights Commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal within 6 months of the date of dismissal (this can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances). It would appear, however, that the person referred to by the Deputy is also statute barred from pursuing a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4565">A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he or she is not replaced. On being made redundant, an employee who has two years service or more in the employment and who fulfils the insurability requirements is entitled to a Statutory Redundancy Payment.  Employees who were made redundant prior to 25th May 2003 were entitled to half a weeks pay for every year of service under 41 and one weeks pay for every year of service over 41, together with a bonus week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4566">There are time limits during which an employee can bring a claim for redundancy.  The time limit for making a lump sum claim to the Employment Appeals Tribunal is 52 weeks after the date of termination of employment.  The Tribunal has discretion to extend the 52-week time limit to 104 weeks provided that it receives the necessary claim within 104 weeks of the date of dismissal and is satisfied that the delay by the employee in making the claim arose through reasonable cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_4567">Since it is over 104 weeks since any possible redundancy took place the person to whom the Deputy refers is now out of time for bringing a claim against his former employer before the Tribunal.</p>

            <p eId="para_4576">I understand from IDA that it owns a total of 273.6 hectares of promotable land in the area of East Cork.  Enterprise Ireland does not own land for industrial purposes but does own the site on which its Cork office is built.  That total site area, including buildings, is 14,190m2.</p>
            <p eId="para_4577">IDA Ireland is actively promoting the greater East Cork region to prospective investors across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies and Internationally Traded Services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.  The area has benefited greatly in recent times from investment in these sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4578">IDA has seen the emergence of an economic corridor along the N25 with the initial development of Little Island many years ago followed by new developments at Eastgate, Fota Business Park, Carrigtwohill and Midleton. IDA has also been instrumental in attracting additional client investment to the area with the development of the IDA Business and Technology Park in Carrigtwohill. More recently, Apex, a fund administration financial services company, announced their decision to locate in Midleton with the creation of 40 jobs. IDA Ireland has found that the availability of quality property solutions in the East Cork area has proved attractive to visiting IDA clients.</p>

            <p eId="para_4581">My Department's records indicate the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4582">2002 — One laptop reported stolen.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4583">2003 — One laptop reported stolen.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4586">2006 — One Blackberry reported lost.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4587">2007 — One Blackberry reported stolen.</p>
            <p eId="para_4588">Of the three laptops reported stolen one was subsequently recovered and none were reported as containing sensitive data at the time. While none of the Blackberry devices have been recovered, my Department invoked the facility to automatically wipe all data from the devices as soon as they were reported missing and immediately cancelled the subscription with the service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_4589">Last year my Department, with the assistance of an external ICT security expert, conducted a comprehensive review of ICT security across my Department and its Offices. The findings of the report now form a significant part of my Department's new ICT Strategy (2008-2010), which will focus on ensuring continuity of ICT availability including increased security awareness of users, additional process and technological controls and ongoing inclusion of security considerations as part of a project's planning process. The Review took into consideration the balance that is required between ensuring integrity and confidentiality of information and systems on one hand, and availability and usability of information on the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_4590">The recent growth of electronic storage devices such as those mentioned in the question is a concern for my Department in terms of how it can ensure that sensitive information remains secure. Indeed, the fact of the matter is that many people including staff of my Department would personally own a number of such devices including memory keys, mobile phones, MP3 players and handheld game consoles. Therefore, my Department is adopting a dual approach by concentrating on both awareness and prevention of any security lapses. An ICT security awareness programme is under way, involving newsletters, workshops and presentations to staff along with reminders of ICT usage policies and regulations. Furthermore, and in light of recent events internationally involving loss of media containing sensitive data, my Department has reviewed the manner in which data are transported within the Department and between the Department and other Public Bodies. A number of changes were made to the processes involved and my Department will continue to implement new procedures and technologies to ensure ongoing improvements in securing sensitive data.</p>

            <p eId="para_4592">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Cork and Kerry, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_4593">I am informed by the Agency that in the period January 2002 to December 2007 a total of 30 IDA supported companies set up in County Cork, while 1 IDA supported company set up in Kerry. The numbers of start–ups in each county in each of the years in question are shown in the tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4594">The South West, comprising counties Cork and Kerry, is one of Ireland's most prosperous regions.  Cork has been designated as a Gateway city under the National Spatial Strategy, while Tralee, Killarney and Mallow have been designated as hubs in the region.  The importance of FDI employment in the South West is evidenced by a payroll cost of over €920 million in 2006 for the almost 22,000 permanent employees in 150 companies. In the same year, it is estimated that Irish materials and services purchased by FDI companies in the South West amounted to almost €1.5 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4595">In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment to the area IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients to encourage them to expand their operations. I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by the Agency together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment for the people of the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_4621">Furthermore the Agency works closely with educational institutions in the region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county and also works with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>

            <p eId="para_4639">The attractiveness of Limerick for inward investment lies in its position as a regional gateway, with the critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region. The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) provides a framework for the development of the Limerick/Shannon gateway. IDA Ireland's regional strategy reflects the NSS, with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4640">Limerick already has a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs, with 39 State supported companies employing 8,960 people in permanent jobs.  Limerick's FDI employment base is dominated by the ICT sector.  IDA's strategy is to re-position the region as a hotspot for knowledge based industry, while focusing on marketing Limerick as a key location for investment by building on the strengths already evident in the County.</p>
            <p eId="para_4641">IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions in the region to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the County.  IDA is also working closely with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as R&amp;D, customer support and back office functions.  IDA also works closely with Shannon Development in the provision of suitable property solutions for potential investors to the county.</p>

In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Cork to encourage the expansion of their operations.

            <p eId="para_4681">The resale of tickets for high-demand events at prices well above their face value is not a new phenomenon.  The form it takes has changed in recent times with the emergence of online trading platforms and of businesses that engage in ticket resale openly and, as they would see it, legitimately.</p>
            <p eId="para_4682">Action in this area could involve either the prohibition or the regulation of ticket resale.  I am not convinced that the first approach is a practical response to a problem that stems from a mismatch between supply and demand.  As ticket resale is no longer an exclusively black market enterprise, there may be a case for examining whether regulation of the resale market is necessary or desirable in the interests of consumers.  I am aware that legislation of this kind has operated in Britain and Northern Ireland since 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_4683">I propose to seek the views of the National Consumer Agency on whether ticket resale is a significant cause of consumer detriment and, if so, what action, if any, might be taken to deal with it.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4685">The Internet is an increasingly aggressive environment and the advice of my Department's ICT security advisers is that all websites and on-line systems run the risk of hacking or some other cyber attack. Many of these attacks are automated and are not targeted at particular individuals or organisations.  Consequently my Department takes the security of its computer systems and the data they contain very seriously. My Department's computer systems are protected by a range of security technologies designed to minimise the potential for hacking or cyber attack.  These systems have the ability to generate alerts and records of unusual or suspicious activity which could indicate that a cyber attack was being attempted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">Over the last few years my Department and its Offices has developed a comprehensive on-line presence comprising 14 separate websites, including three on-line processing systems. Apart from a small number of minor incidents where individual computers have found to have been infected with a virus, my Department's records indicate that noteworthy hacking or cyber attacks have been carried out against the Department's public websites on four separate occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">Three of these attacks were against websites hosted internally within my Department, while the fourth was against a website hosted and maintained by a 3rd party.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">The attacks against the websites hosted within my Department were forensically investigated by an independent firm of ICT security consultants who concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that other servers, networks or data within the Department had been compromised. A full record of these incidents has been created, including a comprehensive report from the consultants. The incidents were reported to An Garda Síochána and I am informed that their investigation is ongoing.These attacks underline the growing importance of ICT security. Maintaining a secure ICT infrastructure is a continuous process, involving a combination of appropriately skilled people and the implementation of best-practice processes and technologies. Last year my Department, with the assistance of external ICT security experts, conducted a comprehensive review of ICT security across the Department and its Offices. The findings of the report now form a significant part of my Department's new ICT Strategy (2008-2010) and in conjunction with the external security consultants a programme of work is currently being undertaken which is designed to deliver ongoing improvements in the security of the Departments' ICT systems. In addition a dedicated Information Security Officer is being appointed to maintain an ongoing focus on Information Security across the Department.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4690">The European Court of Justice issued a Judgement on 18 December 2007 in a case between Laval un Partneri Ltd and Svenska Byggnadsarbetareförbundets and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_4691">The Swedish Labour Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice to determine whether it is permissible under European law for trade unions to take industrial action, in the form of a blockade, to compel a foreign temporary provider of services to sign a collective agreement in the host country where the law of the host country implementing the Posted Workers Directive does not provide for the application of terms and conditions in collective agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4692">In its judgement, the European Court of Justice held that, in the particular circumstances obtaining in the Swedish context, action in the form of a blockade of sites constitutes a restriction on the freedom to provide services, which, in this case, was not justified with regard to the public interest of protecting workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4693">In reaching its judgement, the Court did point out that the Community has not only an economic but also a social purpose and thus the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods and services must be balanced against the objectives pursued by social policy.  In this context, the Court found that the right to take collective action for the protection of workers may constitute an overriding reason of public interest which, in principle, justifies a restriction of one of the fundamental freedoms. The judgement, which issued relatively recently, is complex and is currently still being considered. It appears that the judgement is quite case-specific and hinges, inter alia, on the way in which Sweden has transposed the Posting of Workers Directive into national law. Unlike Ireland, Sweden has no national minimum wage arrangements.  While the implications of the Laval Judgement are being examined, my Department's initial view is that our differing methods of employment protection, including Registered Employment Agreements and Employment Regulation Orders, and the effective manner in which Ireland has implemented the Posted Workers Directive suggest that the judgement is unlikely to have any detrimental impact on Irish workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4696">From the Government's perspective, legislation to provide for a national minimum wage in this country was enacted in 2000.  The minimum wage was introduced as a social policy commitment of the Government in the context of tackling exclusion, marginalisation and poverty with the specific aim of protecting vulnerable workers who are vulnerable to exploitation.  The minimum wage was first set at £4.40 per hour from 1 April 2000 and has been increased on six occasions since then; most recently on 1 July 2007 when the rate was set at €8.65 per hour.</p>
            <p eId="para_4697">Minimum rates of pay in certain sectors and individual enterprises are also governed by Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements.  The Government remains committed to these measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_4704">I am advised by FÁS that it is not currently aware of any Community Employment projects that cannot fill vacancies due to the six year cap for those aged over 55 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4705">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills.  The criteria for participating on the Community Employment programme are based on age and length of time in receipt of various social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4706">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the standard 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment (including those under 55) was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.  Currently there are over 6,646 people over 55 years of age on CE representing 29.5% of the overall CE population.</p>
            <p eId="para_4707">Notwithstanding this enhanced access for those in the over 55 age group, there is a wide range of other client groups which must also be given access to the opportunity CE provides e.g. Lone Parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons aged under 55.  In the delivery of places locally, FÁS is obliged to balance the needs of all groups in terms of access to Community Employment.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4708">CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  It should also be noted that FÁS\Local Employment Service Offices are available to provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available in the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4709">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4768">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_4769">At present there are 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in South Tipperary, employing approximately 2,981 people.  The key industry sector for South Tipperary is Life Sciences, which accounts for almost 90% of employment.  The largest employers are Abbott and Boston Scientific, followed by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Pinewood Laboratories (Workhardt) and Clonmel Healthcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_4770">In marketing South Tipperary for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focused on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge based industries, including advanced manufacturing.  Recent key wins for the County have been Cordis and Alza in Cashel.  Cordis is expected to be operational in the second quarter of this year.  The future development of the Ballingarrane Estate in Clonmel, incorporating an IDA Business Park and Tipperary Institute, will be a key asset in the quest for further overseas investment in the County.  I understand from the Agency that it did not host any visits by potential investors to South Tipperary during 2007.  IDA Ireland continues to work closely with third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment are being developed.  Tipperary Institute and Waterford Institute of Technology are key resources that will be critical to the attraction and maintenance of overseas companies in the County.  In addition, IDA Ireland maintains a close relationship with FÁS so that the requirements of industry, particularly in the areas of training and up-skilling, are being met.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_4772">The Portuguese Presidency tabled for consideration, at the ESPHCA Council, on 5th December 2007, proposed Directives on Temporary Agency Work and the Organisation of Working Time in its efforts to fashion an overall compromise solution by way of an integrated approach to discussions of two sensitive dossiers. Regrettably, having identified the remaining issues of concern to various Member States, the Presidency was unable to progress these dossiers to a successful conclusion and concluded that the best option was to postpone a final decision on these matters. Ireland was fully prepared to assist in trying to resolve outstanding issues at the Council rather than postpone addressing these to a later date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">On my return from Council, I apprised the social partners of the outcome of the discussions and the current state of play regarding future progress of this dossier in a detailed letter dated 13 December 2007.  The Government have at all times indicated that we fully support the thrust of the proposed Directive but that we are concerned that any such instrument must be balanced and respect the different traditions and practices at the national level. Thus if flexibility is to be permitted in the proposed Directive in relation to the principle of equal treatment for those countries with collective agreements which tend to be more binding in nature or legally enforceable, then other means for providing appropriate flexibility should be allowed for those Member States with a tradition of more voluntarist approaches to collective agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">As part of the Government's commitment under the partnership agreement — Towards 2016 — the elements of proposals for the draft Scheme of a Bill to regulate the employment agency sector are being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4775">In the course of consultations on the proposed Bill some parties have raised matters not included in the current partnership agreement, including immediate pay parity on the commencement of employment. This demand is outside the scope of measures agreed in Towards 2016 and, in any case, does not have due regard to the arrangements in other Member States. It does not recognise the need for an appropriate balance with the flexible needs of enterprises and does not have regard for the needs and choices of agency workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4776">With regard to legislation to give effect to the Directive, this does not arise as the Directive has not yet been adopted, as I have already mentioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_4842">I propose to take Questions Nos. 660 and 661 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4843">Achieving balanced regional development is explicit in the core mission statement of both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  It has been a guiding principle in the provision of Enterprise Ireland supports to client companies and in the formulation of initiatives to improve business infrastructure in the regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4844">Enterprise Ireland is fully committed to assisting companies to grow and realise their full potential, working intensively with them on their business plans on a holistic basis to do so.  Enterprise Ireland provides a range of supports, both financial and non-financial for client companies and institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4845">Enterprise Ireland also maintains extensive relationships with all of the regional and local development bodies and has a key partnership role to play with the country's agencies and organisations involved in entrepreneurial development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4846">Enterprise Ireland has approved funding estimated to be over €680 million between 2003 and 2007. This estimate is based on information drawn down from the Enterprise Ireland Client Support System Database. The approvals include funding for support to industry including R&amp;D, and infrastructure such as Community Enterprise Centres (CECs). The estimates also include approvals to Shannon Development clients in the Mid-West over the period, as the indigenous development functions of Shannon Development reverted to Enterprise Ireland with effect from 1 January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4847">The contribution of the FDI sector to our economic growth has been critical. Employment in IDA companies directly accounts for over 136,000 jobs or 42% of Industrial and Financial employment in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4848">In keeping with IDA strategy of enhanced regional development, 64% of investments in 2007 were located outside of Dublin. We can look forward to securing new projects, new R&amp;D operations and some broader research collaborations for Ireland again in 2008 from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, International Services, Information and Communications Technology, Financial Services and Digital Media.</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">I am satisfied that the policies being pursued by both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of continued investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">Investment by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in each of the years 2003 to 2007 are outlined in tabular format.</p>

            <p eId="para_5094">There have been no reported instances in my Department where personal data has been compromised since the date in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5095">My Department is registered with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner for the purpose of the Data Protection Acts.  My Department is very conscious of its obligations under the Data Protection Acts, and of the need to promote awareness among staff of these obligations.  In this regard all induction courses for new staff members include a segment on data protection.  In September 2007 all staff in my Department were issued with a Human Resources Management Handbook in hard copy format, which includes a dedicated Section concerning the provisions of data protection legislation, and highlighting the obligations and responsibilities for staff in this area.  These obligations were reiterated to all staff in my Department by way of an Office Notice in November 2007.  Physical and technical safeguards are in place throughout my Department.  A secure ICT infrastructure and staff awareness programmes play a key role in supporting data protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_5096">Regarding ICT this is a continuous process, involving a combination of appropriately skilled people and the implementation of best-practice processes and technologies.  Last year, my Department with the assistance of external ICT security experts, conducted a comprehensive review of ICT security across the Department and its Offices.  The findings of the report now form a significant part of my Department's new ICT Strategy (2008-2010) and a programme of work is currently being undertaken which is designed to deliver ongoing improvements in the security of the Departments' ICT systems thereby minimizing the risk of compromising data and/or security breaches.  This includes a programme of data protection and security awareness workshops, one of which has already taken place. The workshops are facilitated by experts in the field who prior to the workshop examine the business units involved in terms of information security and data protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_5097">The position in relation to the review by my Department of data security procedures to protect the confidentiality of personal data is that the review is almost complete and a report on the matter is expected to be forwarded to the Department of Finance shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5098">The registration of the agencies of my Department with the Data Protection Commissioner for the purpose of the Data Protection Acts is a day-to-day operational matter for the agencies concerned and one in which I have no function.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_5104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 663 to 667, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5105">The system governing the regulation and supervision of the accountancy and auditing profession has undergone considerable change as a result of the enactment and coming into operation of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003. A major feature of the new system is the establishment of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), one of whose key functions is "to supervise how the prescribed accountancy bodies regulate and monitor their members" (Section 8 of the Act). This function includes approving and requiring changes to these bodies' constitution and bye-laws including their investigation and disciplinary procedures and standards, as well as amendments to these.</p>
            <p eId="para_5106">A person who is not satisfied that an accountant or auditor, having membership of a prescribed accountancy body, has properly discharged their responsibilities can lodge a complaint with the body in question, which must then apply its investigation and disciplinary procedures to the complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_5107">Where these procedures have been exhausted, that person, if still not satisfied, can make a complaint to IAASA. If IAASA has reason to believe that the body's Investigation and Disciplinary Procedures have not been complied with, it may initiate an enquiry under the provisions of Section 23 of the Act. Having completed such an enquiry, if IAASA is not satisfied that the body has complied with its approved investigation and disciplinary procedures, IAASA may:</p>
            <p eId="para_5108">annul all or part of a decision of that body relating to the matter</p>
            <p eId="para_5109">direct the body to conduct an investigation or a fresh investigation into the matter</p>
            <p eId="para_5110">require that body to pay to the Supervisory Authority an amount not exceeding €125,000</p>
            <p eId="para_5111">Under Section 24 of the 2003 Act, following a complaint or on its own initiative, where, in its opinion, it is appropriate or in the public interest, IAASA can undertake an investigation into a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member. If such a breach is found by IAASA, it may impose any sanction to which the member is liable under the rules of the body and an amount towards the costs incurred by it investigating and determining the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5112">A person who is alleging a breach of the criminal law in respect of accounting services received from someone acting as an accountant, can make a complaint to the Garda Síochána or, in where an infringement of company law is being alleged, to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5113">Section 31 of the 2003 Act prohibits disclosure, except in accordance with law, of information that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5114">(a) is obtained in performing the functions or exercising the powers of IAASA, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5115">(b) has not otherwise come to the attention of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_5116">The circumstances where disclosure of information by IAASA is not prohibited are set out at Section 31(3) of the 2003 Act. These include, where the disclosure is, in its opinion, necessary to enable it to state the grounds on which it made a decision under Section 23 or 24 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5117">It is for IAASA to determine, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, whether and to what extent, it may disclose information in relation to any particular case.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_5121">The Government has approved the drafting, by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill along the lines of the General Scheme prepared by the Company Law Review Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">The General Scheme was designed to provide an appropriate framework for the formation and operation of companies and is framed primarily with private, commercially operating companies in mind. The underlying philosophy behind the proposals in the General Scheme is to simplify company law for the benefit of business operators and company law practitioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5123">Recognising the role that company law could play in relation to property management companies, the Company Law Review Group consulted widely on its proposals and gave specific consideration to that aspect. As a result, the General Scheme contains a number of provisions with the express intention of facilitating the use of the company structure by multi-unit developments. For example, the membership limit of 99 which will ordinarily apply to the most common company type, the private company limited by shares, will not apply in the case of a residential management company. Also, the membership of a residential management company will be deemed to transfer from the vendor to the purchaser upon the sale of the underlying property to which the membership relates. These proposals represent very specific carve-outs from the general provisions concerning the standard private company limited by shares.</p>
            <p eId="para_5124">More generally in relation to multi-unit developments, a high-level interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Justice, has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in this area.  A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and other actions to be taken in response to definitive recommendations for reforms which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments, and to determine a timescale for their implementation.  I understand that the Report will be published early this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5131">Skillnets, which is a private company in which the social partners are shareholders, operates the Training Networks Programme on foot of a Funding Agreement and mandate from my Department. Under this Agreement, Skillnets is responsible for decisions on disbursements of funds provided from the National Training Fund, subject to the provisions of the Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5132">The Agreement stipulates that Skillnets adopt a broadly based approach in terms of supporting training in all enterprise sectors, with emphasis on SMEs and training for the lower skilled. Skillnets is also mandated to seek to support the development of training networks across all regions of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_5133">Skillnets is required to support new and existing networks on the basis of open and competitive public calls for proposals and transparent and equitable assessment systems.  Accordingly, Skillnets has in place a project assessment system, including predetermined criteria and an evaluation procedure, which includes independent outside assessors. Decisions on applications for funding are for the Skillnets Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_5134">I am informed by Skillnets that the funding approved for 2008 is sufficient to fund 123 training networks and it is now in the process of agreeing contracts with these projects. On completion of this process, details of approved projects, including their regional spread will be published on the Skillnets Website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5135">I understand from Skillnets that it was not in a position to fund all of the networks which applied. I would point out that the funding for the Skillnets Training Programmes has been significantly increased by the Government from €7.5 million in 2005 to €26.5 million in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_5143">One of the features of this proposed Bill will be the establishment of a statutorily binding code of practice setting out standards of behaviour for employment agencies.  The Bill will also provide for the establishment of a Monitoring and Advisory Committee representative of the Social Partners, the employment agency sector and Government Departments which will have the function, inter alia, of drawing up the code of practice for the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_5153">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.  The programme helps unemployed people to progress to the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assists them in enhancing/developing both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_5154">In April 2000 limits were introduced on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3 years total time on CE from 3rd April, 2000 — participation on CE before this date is disregarded).  CE capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity to avail of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5155">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_5156">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with regard to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  However, it should be remembered that, in so far as participants remain on CE, they are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5157">I am advised by FÁS that it is not currently aware of any Community Employment projects  that cannot fill vacancies due to the six year cap for those aged over 55 years.  I should say that CE numbers on projects in the Drugs, Health and Childcare sectors are ringfenced.  It should also be noted that FÁS and Local Employment Service Offices are available to provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available to those exiting CE.</p>
            <p eId="para_5158">In conclusion then, I would say that this Government will continue to support into the future the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  In this regard, we are keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5259">Considerable progress has been made in the recruitment and deployment of Labour Inspectors over the past year.  There are now 79 Inspectors employed in the National Employment Rights Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5260">Twenty new Inspectors were recruited by the National Employment Rights Authority during 2007 bringing the total number of Inspectors deployed at the 31 December 2007 to fifty.  The twenty Inspectors recruited have completed the core modules of the NERA Inspector training course and all fifty Inspectors deployed are involved in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5261">Since 31st December 2007 and following the competitions that were held towards the end of last year, a further twenty nine Inspectors have been assigned to NERA.  Twenty four of these new Inspectors commenced training in January 2008, four will commence training in February 2008 and a further one will commence training in March 2008.  It is proposed to incorporate these Inspectors in the scheduled training immediately upon assignment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5262">The final batch of eleven candidates is being processed at the moment and assignment dates are being settled individually according to each candidate's current work arrangements and other factors.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_1019">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5310">I propose to take Questions Nos. 693 and 696 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5311">Department Decentralisation: Under the Government's Decentralisation Programme my Department is required to relocate 250 posts to Carlow.  The following business units/Offices of my Department are earmarked for decentralisation: Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies; National Employment Rights Authority (NERA); Work Permits; Redundancy Payments Section; Insolvency Payments Section.</p>
            <p eId="para_5312">As at 31st December 2006, no staff from my department were decentralised to Carlow.  However, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  It is my understanding from the OPW that the yearly rental costs for this office is in the region of €369,000 and the fit-out costs were approximately €2,068,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_5313">The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 100. Of the total number of staff in place in this office, 39 were decentralised from locations outside Dublin with the remainder decentralised from Dublin.  The total number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow is 288.  As well as the 100 posts already decentralised to Carlow, my Department has 49 staff due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for the end of 2009, with a further 34 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments.  The number of staff who have transferred from my Department to other decentralising Departments is 64 and a further 101 staff have applied to decentralise with other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5314">With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department's permanent office in Carlow. I understand from the OPW that the site acquisition costs were €1,440,000. My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the ‘Successful Tenderer' in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.  The successful tenderer is responsible for submitting the planning application.</p>
            <p eId="para_5315">The OPW indicative construction completion date outlined in the 2005 Decentralisation Implementation Group Report was Quarter 2, 2008. I am hopeful, subject to no planning issues arising, that the completion of construction of the permanent office will be in late 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5316">With regard to decentralisation costs incurred to date, the most recent figure for non-property decentralisation costs for my Department, submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance, relates to the period January 2004 to June 2007, and amounts to €121,107 broken down as follows- (Travel and Subsistence €2,953, Incidental €847, Office Machinery €78,935, Office Premises €11752 and Consultancy €26,620).</p>
            <p eId="para_5317">The issue of original figure budgeted for and the expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation is a matter for the Department of Finance.  With regard to the number of staff involved in administering the decentralisation project, a Decentralisation Implementation Committee has been set up to drive the process within my Department.  The Implementation Committee is chaired by the Assistant Secretary, Corporate Services Division and comprises key personnel within the Department who are involved in the decentralisation process.  These include the Department's Decentralisation Liaison Officer, the Heads of Sections/Offices to be decentralised and the Heads of IT Unit, Personnel Section, Training Unit and the Information and Organisation Resource Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5318">The Department's Decentralisation Liaison Officer is responsible for ensuring that messages and issues emerging are transmitted to the Department's Committee and that key messages/issues from the Department and its Offices/Agencies are fed back to the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG), via the Decentralisation Liaison Officers Group (DLOG), and DLOG Agency Subgroup, chaired by the Department of Finance. The Decentralisation Liaison Officer reports regularly to the Department's Management Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_5319">Agency Decentralisation: Under the Government Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already been decentralised, as follows: FÁS.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  In December 2006 there were 2 staff in the FÁS decentralised location in Birr, Co Offaly. FÁS currently has 21 staff members based in Birr who are working out of offices located within the Birr Technology Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_5320">FÁS has completed the purchase of 5.59 acres (approximately) in Birr, Co Offaly, at a cost of  €1.537 million, which excludes professional fees.  A Planning Application is currently being progressed on behalf of FÁS by the vendor's Consultant Engineers and Architects, in discussion with the Consulting Engineers and Architects representing FÁS.  In the meantime, since 6 May 2007 FÁS has leased a floor of a building within the Birr Technology Centre to accommodate staff in the decentralised location pending the construction and fitting out of a permanent Headquarters.  The cost of renting these premises is currently €99,000 per annum plus VAT excluding rates.  The total costs incurred to date are €3.257 m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5321">Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme.  Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by many factors including among others, the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and progress made in discussions at a national level.  To date, no post has moved to Shannon under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5322">Enterprise Ireland (EI) working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.  Latest figures available to EI indicate that the Central Applications Facility reflects that no Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon.  The number of applications received from within the civil and public service amounts to 25.</p>
            <p eId="para_5323">The expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation is not known at this stage.  The most recent figure for non-property decentralisation costs for the EI, as submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance for the period January 2004 to June 2007, are zero.</p>
            <p eId="para_5324">EI now has a major presence in the Shannon region.  EI has established its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon.  Currently there are 40 staff working in the Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place in Shannon over the coming months.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region.  EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Coordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid West Regional are now in place in the Shannon office.  As part of EI's regional strategy, these six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5325">Health and Safety Authority.  The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme.  Twelve serving staff members of the Authority have applied to transfer to Thomastown — 9 of these are based in Dublin.  Fourteen staff of the Authority have applied to transfer to other Departments/Agencies under the decentralisation programme — 8 of these are based in Dublin.  To date a total of 65 civil and public servants, including 12 Authority staff, have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown.</p>
            <p eId="para_5326">In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  On 31 December 2006, 15 Authority staff had re-located to that office.  Currently, 27 staff, including 3 of the 12 internal HSA Thomastown applicants, are based in Kilkenny, and including also new staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy.  The only staff transferred to Kilkenny to date are serving Authority staff, as there is as yet no mechanism in place to facilitate the transfer of other civil or public servants.  All staff currently accommodated in the interim office will move to Thomastown once the new premises are ready for occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5327">The Commissioners of Public Works have signed a contract for sale in respect of the site in Thomastown.  A condition of the contract is that the vendor obtains the appropriate zoning for the site so that the Commissioners' planned development can take place.  The required change of zoning has now been granted and the sale should close shortly.  When the purchase is completed, expressions of interest for the design and build phase, will be invited from interested parties.  It will be a matter for the successful tenderer to apply for planning permission at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5328">The Authority's original date for decentralisation was 3 years from the date of the initial announcement i.e. 3 December 2006.  In the Authority's Decentralisation Implementation Plan, it was proposed to have some movement in 2007 and completion in 2010.  The current estimated timeline for availability for occupancy is 2009/2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5329">The expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation is not known at this stage.  The most recent figure for non-property decentralisation costs for the HSA, submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance, relates to the period January 2004 to June 2007, and amounts to €297,923.  Details of the original budgeted and the expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation is a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5330">NSAI.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  A total of 10 Dublin based staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow.  In addition a further 86 Dublin based civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow.  No staff from the NSAI have transferred to Arklow to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5331">The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW.  To date no progress has been made by the OPW in identifying or securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.  No properties have been purchased or sold by NSAI in respect of the decentralisation process to date and no planning permissions have been sought to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5332">The expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation is not known at this stage.  The most recent figure for non-property decentralisation costs for the NSAI, submitted to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, via the Department of Finance, relates to the period January 2004 to June 2007, and amounts to €24,500 for consultancy services.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5333">National Consumer Agency (NCA).  The National Consumer Agency (NCA), which will be located in Cork City, was formally established on 1st May 2007.  The NCA is currently staffed by employees of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment seconded to assist the Agency.  In terms of the precise location of the Agency within Cork City, this matter is under consideration at present, including issues in relation to the premises and expected total costs etc.  The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff.  Furthermore, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to the manner in which the Central Applications Facility shall apply to the relocation.  The Agency is expected to relocate to Cork in the course of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA).  As the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) is based in Naas, Co Kildare, the question of public servants based in Dublin is not applicable.  IAASA has an authorised staffing level of 15, 9 of whom are in situ.  An open recruitment campaign is currently under way to fill a number of the Authority's remaining professional staff vacancies.  It is, therefore, open to any member of the public (including civil/public servants wishing to relocate) meeting the required qualifications for these posts to apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">IAASA was established in December, 2005, and moved to its offices in Kildare in the following month.  All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Co Kildare since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.  IAASA does not own any land or property, nor has it sought any planning permissions.  Its offices are leased on its behalf by the Office of Public Works, said lease being for 20 years expiring in September, 2025.  The full rental cost of €119,163 per annum is reimbursed to the OPW.  As IAASA has been located in its decentralised location since its establishment, no specific decentralisation costs have been incurred.</p>

            <p eId="para_5337">The Forfás Annual Employment Survey reports on job gains and losses in companies that are clients of the industrial development agencies.

The number of new jobs created in IDA supported companies in Limerick and the Mid West, Dublin, Cork, Galway and Waterford during 2007 is set out in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5338">Information on job numbers is provided by companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only.  This information is aggregated at county level.  It is therefore not possible to provide information at company level or for individual locations throughout the country.

            <p eId="para_5339">Foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to contribute strongly to the Irish economy.  In addition to direct benefits, FDI has multiplier effects throughout the economy, creates demand for high skills, advanced management and business processes, and guides beneficial national developments in education, science, telecommunications and other infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5340">I am confident that the policies being pursued by the Agency together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruits in terms of economic investment in the years ahead.</p>

         the number of civil servants and other public servants, who have relocated to locations outside of Dublin under the Government’s decentralisation programme; the estimated number of each category who will have relocated by the end of 2008; the breakdown of each set of figures in terms of those who are relocating from Dublin and relocating from elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_1021">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5360">My Department is required to relocate 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme and this is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5361">In order to accommodate staff who wished to move earlier than the projected building completion date of late 2009, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 100, and this figure is not expected to change significantly in 2008.  Of the staff in place in this office, 39 were decentralised from locations outside Dublin with the remainder decentralised from Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5362">The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow is 288.  As well as the 100 posts already decentralised to Carlow, my Department has 49 staff due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for 2009, with a further 34 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5363">Agency Decentralisation.  Under the current Government Decentralisation Programme, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already decentralised as follows: FÁS.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme, FÁS is due to transfer its head office including some 383 posts to Birr, Co Offaly.  FÁS currently has 21 staff members based in Birr.</p>
            <p eId="para_5364">Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme.  Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by many factors including among others, the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and progress made in discussions at a national level.  To date, no post has moved to Shannon under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5365">EI now has a major presence in the Shannon region.  EI has established its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has established the County Enterprise Support Unit in Shannon.  Currently there are 40 staff working in EI's Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place in Shannon over the coming months.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region.  EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Coordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid West Regional are now in place in the Shannon office.  As part of EI's regional strategy, these six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5366">Health and Safety Authority.  The Health and Safety Authority is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme.  12 serving staff members of the Authority have applied to transfer to Thomastown — 9 of these are based in Dublin.  14 staff of the Authority have applied to transfer to other Departments/Agencies under the decentralisation programme — 8 of these are based in Dublin.  To date a total of 65 civil and public servants, including 12 Authority staff, have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown.</p>
            <p eId="para_5367">In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city.  Currently, 27 staff, including 3 of the 12 internal HSA Thomastown applicants, are based in Kilkenny and including also new staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy.  The only staff transferred to Kilkenny to date are serving Authority staff, as there is as yet no mechanism in place to facilitate the transfer of other civil or public servants.  All staff currently accommodated in the interim office will move to Thomastown once the new premises are ready for occupation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5368">NSAI.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  A total of 10 Dublin based staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow.  In addition a further 86 Dublin based civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow.  No staff from the NSAI have transferred to Arklow to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5369">The National Consumer Agency (NCA), which will be located in Cork City, was formally established on 1st May 2007.  The NCA is currently staffed by employees of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment seconded to the Agency.  The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff.  Furthermore, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to the manner in which the Central Applications Facility shall apply to the relocation.  The Agency is expected to relocate to Cork in the course of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5370">National Consumer Agency and Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority.  As the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) is based in Naas, Co Kildare, the question of public servants based in Dublin is not applicable.  IAASA has an authorised staffing level of 15, 9 of whom are in situ.  An open recruitment campaign is currently under way to fill a number of the Authority's remaining professional staff vacancies.  It is, therefore, open to any member of the public (including civil/public servants wishing to relocate) meeting the required qualifications to apply for these posts.  IAASA was established in December, 2005, and moved to its offices in Kildare in the following month.  All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Co Kildare since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.</p>

            <p eId="para_5372">A total of 200 posts in Fáilte Ireland, one of the State Agencies under the aegis of my Department, were designated for transfer to Mallow under the Government's Programme of Decentralisation.  In June 2004, a Decentralisation Implementation Plan was prepared by Fáilte Ireland and submitted to the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG).  Following a recent meeting with the DIG, Fáilte Ireland is preparing a new Decentralisation Implementation Plan and is also examining the possibility of sending an advance group to Mallow.</p>
            <p eId="para_5373">A total of 87 applications for transfer to Mallow have so far been received under the Central Application Facility (CAF).  No member of staff of Fáilte Ireland has expressed an interest on the CAF in relocating to Mallow.  Fáilte Ireland has not been designated an early mover by the DIG.  However, the Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently assessing a number of options regarding suitable locations and properties in Mallow.  No decision has been made in this regard to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_5404">The percentage of total Exchequer funding for the horse racing industry (i.e. from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund) generated from off-course betting in 2006 was 77.4 % and in 2007 is estimated to be 49.7 %, with the balance being made up by the Exchequer in 2006 of 22.6 % and an estimated 50.3% in 2007.  It should be noted that the 2007 figures for off-course betting receipts duty are estimates.  I have been informed by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, that the decline in revenue from off course betting in 2007 is due primarily to the reduction of betting duty from 2 % to 1 %, with effect from 1 July 2006, as provided for in the Finance Act 2006.  The Deputy should also be aware that at the time of the enactment of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001 the rate of betting duty was 5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5405">In 2006 the current sports budget (and expenditure) was €102.4 million.  The total Exchequer funding to Horse Racing Ireland (i.e. from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund) was €56.1 million and of this, €48.7 million was allocated to current expenditure, with €7.4 million allocated to capital expenditure, giving a percentage of 47.6 % of current sports funding allocated to HRI current funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_5406">In 2007 the current sports budget (and provisional outturn) was €118.2 million.  The total Exchequer funding to Horse Racing Ireland (i.e. from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund) was €58.5 million and of this, €50.6 million was allocated to current expenditure, with €7.9 million allocated to capital expenditure, giving a percentage of 42.8 % of current sports funding allocated to HRI current funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_5443">In the years from 2002 to 2006 my Department consistently reached the 3% employment quota for people with disabilities. However significant staff changes in the context of the decentralisation of my Department to Killarney have had an effect on the numbers since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_5444">In accordance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 my Department compiled information relating to the number of people working in the Department who have a disability.  The data received suggests that the percentage of people working in my Department who have a disability is 1.7%.  It should be noted that the National Disability Authority has identified certain limitations which are common to all public service and civil service bodies in relation to the data gathering process and it is my understanding that further proposals are to be made by the NDA in this regard.  My Department will liaise with the National Disability Authority in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5445">It is not possible to say how many people with disabilities have been hired from outside the civil service as people are not required to disclose a disability when they are being employed. My Department employed an officer under the Willing Able and Mentoring (WAM) programme in 2006 but it was not possible to do so in 2007 due to staff turnover generally and the timing of transfers to my Department's temporary offices in Killarney.</p>

            <p eId="para_5448">I propose to take Questions Nos. 717 and 719 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5449">Following the announcement of the Government's decentralisation programme in the 2004 budget, my Department, which has a staff of 131, excluding the National Archives which is part of my Department, was designated an "early mover" by the Decentralisation Implementation Group. (DIG).  Initially, 15 staff from my Department applied for decentralisation to the designated location in Killarney, Co Kerry.  Some of these have since opted to remain in Dublin.  Subsequently, the Central Application Facility (CAF) received a further 152 applications from existing Civil Servants and 9 applications from Public Servants from both the Dublin area and from provincial locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5450">To date, 70 staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney, in two tranches, 45 staff in September 2006 and 25 staff in July 2007.  The objective is to complete the decentralisation process by the end of 2008 by which time the Department will be operating from the Department's new purpose built offices in Killarney.</p>
            <p eId="para_5451">To effect the final phase of the decentralisation of my Department over the next twelve months it will be necessary to transfer 61 additional staff from both Dublin and provincial locations.  Of these, 16 staff who intend to transfer to Killarney later this year are currently in place in my Department in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5452">To expedite the decentralisation process, temporary premises were secured by the OPW (Office of Public Works) in Fossa in 2006 from which the decentralised sections of my Department currently operate. I understand from the OPW that the new permanent building is on schedule for completion, with the planning process completed, and they expect it to be furnished, equipped and ready for occupation, on target, by the end of the year. No further planning applications are necessary in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5453">Excluding the cost of accommodation, the total cost of decentralisation incurred by my Department to date is €552,000, which includes the cost of office machinery, office and premises overheads, postal and telecommunications services and travel and subsistence.  The bulk of the expenditure relates to office machinery and office and premises expenses, which represents over 70% of the total cost.   The OPW are responsible for costs relating to both the temporary and permanent accommodation and therefore these do not fall within my Department's Vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_5454">The implementation of the Decentralisation process has been effected to date within the existing staffing resources of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5455">No public servants in any of the agencies under the aegis of my Department designated for decentralisation have relocated to date. A total of 200 posts in Fáilte Ireland were designated for relocation to Mallow, 45 posts in the Arts Council to Kilkenny and 25 posts in the Irish Sports Council to Killarney.  The agencies were not designated as "early movers" by the DIG.  However the OPW are assessing various property options in respect of the three agencies. No planning applications have been made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5456">Expenditure by the agencies in respect of decentralisation is a matter for the agencies themselves I understand that no expenditure has been incurred to date.</p>

         if the situation still persists whereby a person aged 65/66 in receipt of a contributory State pension is precluded from working whereas a person over 66 can work and receive said pension; the reason for the existence of this situation; and if he will take action to change it.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5462">The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement at age 65. Because of the purpose for which the scheme was introduced, a key qualifying condition was that a person had to be retired in order to qualify for a payment. Retirement was defined as not engaging in insurable employment, which today means earning less than €38 per week. The social welfare pension age was subsequently reduced in stages until it reached 66 years of age, which means that the retirement condition is now only effective for 1 year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5463">I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.   Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and it can also be beneficial to the individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_5464">The retirement condition associated with the state pension (transition) is only one aspect of a much broader agenda which will need to be addressed if we are to create the conditions where people can continue in employment past what we now regard as normal retirement age.</p>
            <p eId="para_5465">As the House is aware, I published the Green Paper on Pensions on 17th October and this includes an examination of all the issues surrounding retirement age, the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment and the incentives in this regard which can be considered.   A consultation process on the Green Paper is now underway and will remain open until mid 2008.  The Government will respond to the process by publishing a framework for future pensions policy and I expect that this will happen towards the end of the year.</p>

The exchange rates for converting Sterling and other non-Euro currencies are published quarterly in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_5634">Under this mechanism the conversion rate used for means testing purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter. This rate is then used in all conversions made during the course of the succeeding quarter.  Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is found to be more beneficial to the customer.</p>

        <b>Deputy Martin Mansergh</b>
         asked the

         the number of Acts passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas sponsored by his Department in each year from 2003 to 2007; the Acts which were legislation wholly or mainly required by Ireland’s EU obligations, which were partly so required, and which had no significant or minimal reference to EU legislation; and if in the first two cases Ireland had significant discretion, as to the manner in which EU obligations were translated into domestic law.

            <p eId="para_5692">During the period 2003 to 2007, a total of thirteen (13) Acts, sponsored by the Department, were passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. In general, these Acts contain the legislative basis of the Social Welfare code, and provide for the schemes and services operated by the Department, and through the agencies which come under its remit. None of these Acts were wholly or mainly necessitated by the State's EU obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5693">In recent years, however, these Acts have also facilitated amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 in relation to supplementary pension provision. In this regard the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 amended the Pensions Act to provide for the implementation of Council Directive 2003/41/EC of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), generally referred to as the IORPs Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5694">The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 also provided for the substitution of Part VII of the Pensions Act 1990. Part VII provided for equal treatment of men and women in Occupational Benefit Schemes. This new part further provided for the implementation of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (Race Directive) and 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000, establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Framework Employment Directive) as they apply to Occupational Pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5695">In the course of implementing such Directives, officials from the Department sought advice from the Commission, where necessary, in relation to issues which arose regarding Ireland's interpretation of certain requirements. The Department was in a position to implement these Directives in full and within the required timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_5696">The Acts sponsored by the Department are as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_5778">The back to education allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.

            <p eId="para_5779">The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.

            <p eId="para_5840">The main condition for receipt of Respite Care Grant are that the person or persons in respect of whom the application is made must require full-time care and attention and that the applicant must be providing that care.  The legislation provides that a person is regarded as requiring full-time care and attention where they require continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or to avoid danger to themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5841">The person to whom the Deputy refers submitted an application for a Respite Care Grant in respect of his mother and his brother. In relation to the applicant's brother, the Deciding Officer refused the application on the grounds that the care being given is in the nature of help around the house and farm which does not constitute the care and attention envisaged by the legislation. In relation to the applicant's mother, the application was refused on the grounds that her condition is not such that she requires the level of care envisaged by the legislation.  The Deciding Officer based this decision on the advice of a Medical Assessor who reviewed the medical evidence submitted by her General Practitioner. Also, in relation to the applicant's mother, the Deciding Officer was not satisfied that the level of care he was providing was consistent with that envisaged in the Respite Care Grant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5842">The above decisions were appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which operates independently of my Department. The Appeals Officer examined all the evidence submitted, including that adduced at an oral hearing, and upheld the decision of the Deciding Officer. A decision by an Appeals Officer's is final, but can be revised if new evidence, new facts or any relevant change of circumstances come to light after a decision is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_5843">It is open to the person concerned to make an application for the 2008 Respite Care Grant, if he feels that he may qualify. The earliest date for receipt of any such application is 10th April 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_5845">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. This includes people aged 66 or over, such as missionaries, returning from abroad to live in Ireland. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass. The scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension and who are resident here.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">Legal advice indicates that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad, when they return here for a visit, as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</p>

         if he will refer to the disregard of earnings from employment of €200 per week when assessing means for non-contributory State pensions; if he will include persons who are in receipt of small pensions from their previous employers in this category where this is their only source of income; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5855">In 2006, a wide range of important reforms were announced for non-contributory pensioners, including pensioners in receipt of occupational pensions, in conjunction with the introduction of the State pension (non- contributory). The new pension replaced a range of non-contributory payments for persons aged 66 and over including the old age pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_5856">All these schemes currently featured a common means disregard of €7.60 per week, which had not increased since the 1970s. This general disregard was increased to €20 with effect from September 2006 and was subsequently increased to €30 with effect from January 2007. Approximately, 34,000 pensioners who were in receipt of a reduced rate of payment gained from these changes, including many thousands of persons in receipt of occupational pensions and social security pensions from other countries. Persons in receipt of the reduced personal rates of pensions gained by up to €22.50 per week with additional gains for persons with qualified adults. Of the 34,000 pensioners in receipt of a reduced rate of payment in 2006, about 12,000 of these are now in receipt of the maximum rate of payment. In addition, from September 2006, a specific additional earnings disregard of €100 per week (now €200 per week) was also introduced where the pensioner is in employment i.e. working for an employer. This disregard is intended as an initial incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_5857">This disregard does not apply to income from any other sources. Income from sources other than employment, including pensions was covered by the enhanced general means disregard of €30 per week referred to above.</p>
            <p eId="para_5858">The increases and other improvements in pensions over many years have been one of the major achievements of the Government. Since 2002, the level of the State pension non-contributory has increased by over 58% from €134 to €212 following Budget 2008. This improvement has had a marked impact on the living standards of older people enabling them to face the future with a greater sense of security and dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_5859">This is most strikingly shown in the numbers of older people deemed to be at risk of poverty, measured on a relative income basis. The most recent figures from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), which were published late last year, have confirmed the steady improvements of recent years. The risk of poverty rate for older people has fallen from just under 30% in 2003 to 13.6% in 2006. The fall last year was 6.5 percentage points from the previous year and this is before the significant improvement in social welfare pensions in 2007, and those announced in Budget 2008, are taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_5860">The Government is determined to maintain and improve on the progress we have made in improving pensioners' incomes. It is committed to achieving a pension of at least €300 per week by 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5862">The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.</p>
            <p eId="para_5863">The new social assistance payment, currently being developed by officials in the Department will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — for it is employment that offers the best route out of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_5864">Extensive consultation has been carried out at various stages in the development of the proposal. Submissions were invited from a range of organisations when the work first commenced in 2005. Thirty-nine organisations were contacted, including organisations participating in social partnership, lone parent organisations and other relevant organisations. Submissions were received from thirteen of these.</p>
            <p eId="para_5865">On publication of the Government Discussion Paper on ‘Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents', the Department of Social and Family Affairs organised a consultative forum to which a range of lone parent representative organisations, men's groups, women's groups, relevant agencies, opposition spokespersons, members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs, and other Government departments were invited. The Forum took place in Farmleigh on 27th April 2006. It was attended by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who presented the proposals and the groups attending also presented their views. At the consultation forum groups were invited to make further written submissions and to meet with the Minister if they so wished, which a number of groups did. In May 2006 the Minister participated in a debate on the discussion paper in the Seanad and has presented the proposals to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5866">This consultation has continued as the proposals are being further developed in this Department and across the other relevant Departments and agencies. A number of meetings have taken place between officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and lone parents groups. Presentations of the proposals have been made at various fora around the country. The discussion at these meetings and events has, and continues to assist in the development of the proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_5871">In 2003 the Departments network suffered an outbreak of the Welchia/NACHI network worm which caused serious network problems, but did not cause any loss of data.

            <p eId="para_5872">In 2002 a telephone hacking incident occurred but the Department reacted swiftly to the intrusion and quickly sealed off the danger area. It has since then undertaken a major telephony hardware and software upgrade to guard against further similar attacks.</p>

Under the relevant legislative provisions, a number of categories are specifically excluded from receiving the allowance. These are people in full-time work, people in full-time education and people involved in trade disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5921">In any individual case, the decision as to whether an applicant is entitled to an SWA payment is a matter for a Community Welfare officer (CWO), based on the circumstances of the applicant. While there is no automatic entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance in circumstances where another social assistance claim is in process, the CWO may award SWA in any case where the HSE considers that the circumstances of the case so warrant. The person concerned applied for Jobseekers Allowance (JA) in July 2007 and he has been in receipt of basic SWA since September 2007 pending the assessment of his entitlement to JA.</p>
            <p eId="para_5922">The person concerned had been asked by both the social welfare Local Office and the CWO in the HSE, to provide additional information in order that his claim for JA could be processed in addition to ensuring the continuance of his SWA claim. The person concerned failed to provide the additional information relevant to his claim and he was duly notified that his SWA claim would be suspended. The CWO suspended his SWA claim on 2nd January due to the non provision of requested information relevant to his claims for SWA. The person concerned called to the CWO this week and has been advised that his claim for SWA can be re-examined when the additional information requested has been provided. To date the Executive have not received this information.</p>

            <p eId="para_5925">I propose to take Questions Nos. 758 and 759 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5926">In general there is no limit or restriction on the proportion or number of people that may receive rent supplement in an area. However Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5927">This provision is aimed at supporting Government investment in regeneration and attaining a good social mix between private, social, affordable and voluntary housing. The measures provided for in Section 25 are not a blanket refusal of rent supplement in areas of regeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5928">Specific provision is made to ensure that people already residing in such areas and in receipt of rent supplement may continue to receive payment; and people already residing in such areas in rental accommodation and who may have recourse to rent supplement in the future, would not have their entitlement restricted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5929">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on behalf of the department by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>

            <p eId="para_5931">The Health Service Executive has advised that it has refused payment of a rent supplement in this case on the grounds that the person concerned is engaged in full-time education and is not in receipt of a back to education allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5932">People in full-time education are normally excluded from receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, people participating in approved courses and who qualify for back to education allowance, receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment. They may also qualify for rent supplement, subject to the standard qualifying conditions of the rent supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5933">To qualify for participation in the back to education allowance scheme, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age.  Lone parents and others may access the scheme at 18 years if they are out of formal education for 2 years or more.  An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of people wishing  to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of people wishing to pursue a third level qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_5934">The person concerned does not qualify for back-to-education allowance as she is less than 21 years of age and has been engaged in formal education within the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5935">The decision not to award a back to education allowance in this case has been reviewed and the original decision not to award payment has been upheld.</p>

            <p eId="para_5950">The Health Service Executive has advised that while no formal application for assistance has been received, under the supplementary allowance scheme, the person concerned was advised informally that she is not eligible for payment of rent supplement as she is in full-time education and is not in receipt of a back to education allowance. It is open to the person concerned to make a formal application for rent supplement to her local community welfare officer. If she is unhappy with the outcome of this decision, the person concerned may lodge an appeal against the decision with the Appeals Office of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5951">People in full-time education are normally excluded from receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, people participating in approved courses and who qualify for back to education allowance, receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment.  They may also qualify for rent supplement, subject to the standard qualifying conditions of the rent supplement scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5953">This Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands. The available resources are then used to discharge the Department's obligations towards our customers and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_5954">Carers Allowance is a social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain income limits. The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full time care and attention is required and being provided and that a means test, is satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_5955">The time taken to process a Carers Allowance claim includes three important elements; the time taken to carry out a medical examination of the claimant, where this is required, investigation of the claimant's means by a Social Welfare Inspector which can necessitate a visit to the claimant's home and confirmation that full time care is being provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_5956">There has been a continuous upward trend in recent years in applications for Carers Allowance. The Department received 10,700 new applications in 2006 and received over 18,000 in 2007.  The average time to decide a claim in December 2007 was just over 10 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5957">Disability Allowance is a weekly Allowance paid to people with a specified disability who are aged over 16 and under 66. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both medical assessment and a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_5958">The time taken to process a Disability Allowance claim includes two important elements; the time taken to carry out a medical examination of the claimant, where this is required and investigation of the claimant's means by a Social Welfare Inspector which can necessitate a visit to the claimant's home.</p>
            <p eId="para_5959">The number of disability allowance claims received in 2007 was 20,000 as compared with 17,600 in 2006.  The average time to decide a claim in November 2007 was about 16 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5960">Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide support for employees on low earnings with families. FIS is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions and a claim for renewal may then be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_5961">Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer.  In 2006, the Department received some 33,000 new and renewal FIS claims and 38,000 claims were received in 2007. The average time to award a FIS claim or renewal is close to 15 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5962">One-parent Family Payment is a payment for men and women who are bringing up a child without the support of a partner.  In most instances the applicant must be interviewed by a Social Welfare Inspector.  Once the Inspector completes his/her report the file is returned to a deciding officer to determine the eligibility of the applicant to payment.   The average processing time for One-parent Family payment claims is about 9 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5963">State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means tested payment for persons over 66 years of age. All income is assessable as means and this includes cash income, private pensions, foreign pensions, the value of any property (excluding the claimant's own home) and the value of any investments and capital which the claimant may have. Applications for State Pension (Non-Contributory) may necessitate a visit by a local Social Welfare Inspector to the applicant's home.</p>
            <p eId="para_5964">In 2007 the number of new customers awarded pension was 9620. This was an increase of 18.6 % on the 2006 figure of 8113. In December 2007 the processing time for claims was 18 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5965">In order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory) (SPC) at age 66, a claimant must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions.  These require the claimant to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5966">(1) have entered into insurable employment before age 56;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5967">(2) have at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5968">(3) have a yearly average of at least 10 contributions recorded (taking paid and  credited PRSI Contributions into account) from 1953 or from the date of entry   into insurance (whichever is the later) to the end of the last complete    contribution year before reaching pension age. In order to qualify for the maximum rate a yearly average of 48 contributions is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5969">In 2007 a total of 20,170 new customers were awarded SPC bringing the total figure in payment to 237,599.  The current processing time for awarding domestic SPC claims is just under 11 weeks.  Where the claim involves employment in another EU country the processing time is approximately 17 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5970">In order to qualify for a State Pension (Transition) (SPT) at age 65, a claimant must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions.  These require the claimant to:</p>
            <p eId="para_5971">have retired from insurable employment;</p>
            <p eId="para_5972">have entered into insurable employment before age 55;</p>
            <p eId="para_5973">have at least 260 reckonable contributions paid;</p>
            <p eId="para_5974">and to have a yearly average of not less than 24 contributions paid or credited from 1953, or from the year of one's entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</p>
            <p eId="para_5975">In 2007 a total of some 8,000 new customers was awarded SPT. The current processing time for awarding SPT claims is 10 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_5976">Supplementary Welfare Allowance</p>
            <p eId="para_5977">It is open to all Social Welfare applicants to apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance while their claim is being processed. The Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive.  Claims for SWA are processed by the Community Welfare Service at approximately a thousand locations throughout the country.  The majority of SWA claims are processed within a matter of days.  Any instance of excessive delays in processing claims should be brought to the attention of Community Welfare Service management in the particular Health Service Executive area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5978">I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that 75% of appeals are processed within 14 weeks, while in general all appeals are cleared within 22 weeks.  In addition to affording customers the right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, all customers who receive an adverse decision are advised of their right, where new facts or fresh evidence comes to light, to have their claim reviewed by a Deciding Officer of my Department.  These procedures can enable a speedy resolution of the appeal as the Deciding Officer may make a revised decision on foot of the new facts or evidence received.</p>
            <p eId="para_5979">The social welfare appeals process is quasi-judicial and it is necessary for the Appeals officer to be satisfied that he/she has all the facts before making a decision on a case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5980">Gathering all the evidence takes time and impacts on the speed at which appeals can be decided.  Furthermore, the Appeals officer must give the person making the appeal and the Deciding Officer the opportunity to make their views known on the facts of the appeal.  In addition, where illness or disability is involved, it may be necessary to have a further examination carried out by a Medical Assessor of my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5982">The scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling and related supports is administered by the Family Support Agency. The focus of the scheme of grants is on the development of support services in the community for families, to enhance stability in family life and to assist families and their members deal with difficult periods which they may experience. The aim of the scheme is to ensure an accessible, high quality service which is delivered at low cost to the client.</p>
            <p eId="para_5983">The grant is intended to meet the running costs of providing a counselling/ support service. Capital funding e.g funding for buildings is not available under the scheme. Similarly, the cost of training counsellors is not fundable under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5984">Financial support for the counselling grants scheme has risen from almost €7.5 million in 2004 to almost €11 million in 2008. Funding under the specific heading of marriage and relationships counselling has also increased dramatically in the last 4 years. In 2008 approximately €6 million has been allocated to marriage counselling.</p>
            <p eId="para_5985">The following criteria are taken into consideration in allocating the grant funding — The demand for the service: this includes the number of clients using the service, the capacity to deliver the service and the number of people waiting for an appointment.The quality of the service: this includes management and back-up support for the service and the qualifications and training of the counsellors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5986">The majority of organisations providing a counselling service have professional indemnity insurance. This is generally taken into consideration as one of the indicators of the standard and quality of services being provided by an organisation and is required with the grant application.</p>
            <p eId="para_5987">Under the 2007 scheme of grants for marriage, child and bereavement services, Retrovaille Ireland sought and received a grant of €15,000 towards the provision of marriage and relationship counselling.</p>
            <p eId="para_5988">The 2008 scheme was advertised in the national and provincial papers the week commencing 21st January 2008. The closing date for receipt of applications is Friday 22nd February 2008. Application forms have issued to all organizations that received funding in 2007, including Retrovaille.</p>
            <p eId="para_5989">Retrovaille's application for funding under the Scheme in 2008, including their application for funding to establish a regional service in Cork for the provision of marriage counselling, will be considered having regard to the available resources and the overall demand for funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_5991">Carer's allowance is a means tested social welfare payment for people providing full time care and attention to people who need it. In line with social assistance payments generally, one of the eligibility requirements for carer's allowance is that the applicant be habitually resident in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5992">All applicants, regardless of nationality, are required to be habitually resident in the State in order to qualify for carer's allowance. The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the criteria to be applied in determining whether or not a person is habitually resident.</p>
            <p eId="para_5993">Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_5994">The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_5995">The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006 and the report of the Review was published on 1st February 2007. The full content of the Review may be accessed on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.  I have no plans to further review the application of the habitual residence condition at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5997">The Department is committed to meeting the 3% target in accordance with its obligations under the Disability Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5998">According to its records, the current number of staff with a disability serving in the Department in January 2008 was 141 or 2.92% of total serving staff. This figure can fluctuate from time to time due to staff churn.</p>
            <p eId="para_5999">Under the self-disclosure survey, "Count Me In", developed by the National Disability Authority (NDA) for use by public bodies, 112 members of staff disclosed that they had a disability. The National Disability Authority is currently preparing another survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_6000">The majority of people with disabilities who were recruited in the Department were recruited by way of competitions conducted by the Public Appointments Service (PAS).

The format in which records are held in the Department are not amenable to analysis to show the number of staff with a disability recruited by open competition for those years in question.</p>

However, I understand from Waterways Ireland that cognisance has been given to the recommendations set out in the RPS Cairns Report in developing a planned programme of works for the Royal Canal and its towpaths. Waterways Ireland continues to work closely with relevant local authorities in the upgrading of the Royal Canal under the National Development Plan, while also working to fully re-open the Canal in 2009 from Spencer Dock in Dublin to Richmond Harbour in County Longford.</p>

            <p eId="para_6132">The gross value of the Dormant Accounts Fund at 31 December 2007 was approximately €205 million and when account is taken of outstanding liabilities, the net value of the Fund was €104 million.  The liabilities relate to approved funding that has yet to be drawn down.  The attached summary table provides a profile of the Fund showing yearly inflows, reclaims, disbursements etc. from 2003 to 2007.  This table is available on my Department's website (www.pobail.ie) and is updated regularly.</p>
            <p eId="para_6133">In relation to the numbers of unclaimed accounts etc., the Deputy will be aware that under the legislation, credit institutions and insurance undertakings are required, each April, to transfer to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), all moneys falling dormant in the previous year.  The NTMA, who are responsible for managing the Dormant Accounts Fund, advises that on 31st December 2007, there were 2.2 million unclaimed bank, building society and Post Office Savings Bank accounts and 1.1 million unclaimed life assurance policies.  In addition, there was €4.4 million in the Fund from the Escheated Estate Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_6266">The Deputy will be aware from previous PQ replies in relation to this subject that the core objective of the process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and  alignment of local delivery structures.  The intention is that for the future there will be one local development company in any given area and fewer local development companies overall. This will provide full county coverage and eliminate overlaps and previous fragmented arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6267">Following exhaustive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development companies in March of last year and clarified the arrangements in relation to the membership of the boards of these bodies in late July.  LEADER and Partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department provided detailed guidelines in October 2007 to assist in securing this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_6268">Companies involved in the formation of integrated structures, which envisage the merger of existing LEADER and Partnership  groups, were asked to forward to the Department by mid December, evidence of measures taken to complete the cohesion process.  In the case of the companies referred to by the Deputies and other groups involved in the alignment process, this deadline has now been extended to the end of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_6269">As I have previously indicated to the House, significant practical issues will arise for the new integrated companies following their establishment.   In relation to the steps to be taken following incorporation of the new structures, companies have been asked to have regard to the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131 of 2003). These Regulations deal with the rights of employees in the context of a transfer of undertaking, business or part of a business from one employer to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger.</p>

            <p eId="para_6316">Problem drug use is a complex and difficult issue and our efforts to tackle it in Ireland must be seen in the context of the global nature of the problem.  While progress is being made, problem drug use will, I believe, continue to challenge us in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6317">The continued implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 represents a comprehensive response by Government to problem drug use in our society.   Overall, I believe that huge efforts are being made from the ground up to tackle the problem and the Government is committed to prioritising this issue.  Indicative of this is the fact that the Government is spending over €200 million p.a. on measures aimed directly at problem drug users through the various drugs programmes being implemented by a range of Government Departments and agencies.  This figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of, in the normal way, by those affected by problem drug use.   Commitments in the Programme for Government in this regard also underline the continuing priority being given by Government to the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_6318">The specific achievements of my Department under the Strategy include the many projects that have been developed through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces, capital projects developed under the Premises Initiative Fund and preventative actions undertaken through the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund.  The process of developing a new National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009–2016 has commenced in my Department.  In this context, a Steering Group has been established with representatives from the key statutory, community and voluntary interests involved in tackling problem drug use.  The work of the Group will continue over the coming months and I look forward to the development of a new Strategy that will further strengthen our overall response to the evolving drugs problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_6319">The changing nature of problem drug use, particularly the emergence of cocaine and polydrug use, present huge challenges for all of us.  However, I am confident that, building on our experiences to date and with all sectors working together, we can meet these challenges.</p>

A Steering Group has been established to oversee the development of the Strategy and it held its first meeting on 10 January.  The Group includes representatives from the key statutory, community and voluntary interests involved in tackling problem drug use.</p>
            <p eId="para_6322">Over the coming months, the Group will be examining the progress and impact of the current Strategy, the degree to which it continues to be relevant and the operational effectiveness of the structures involved. They will also be looking at developments in regard to drug policies at EU and international levels.  At the conclusion of the process, the Steering Group will submit recommendations to me on the shape and direction of the new Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6323">I can assure the Deputy that a comprehensive public consultation process will be undertaken over the coming months as part of the work of developing the new Strategy.  Indeed, I intend to be involved directly in many of the consultation meetings that are planned.  I hope to be in a position to bring the new Strategy to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion by the end of this year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_6377">The Deputy will be aware that I announced indicative allocations of funding for 2008 of approximately €23m to some 180 projects under the Community Development Programme on the 4th January.  This funding is to be used to cover staff and operating costs for providing a resource centre or community support countrywide.  The 2008 allocations represented an increase of some 8% on the level of funding granted to these groups in 2007.  All projects were informed of their indicative allocation on the 18th and 19th December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_6378">The first instalment of one quarter of the 2008 allocation was paid during the first two weeks of January subject to compliance with the Department's contractual arrangements with projects.  The remainder can be drawn down by the projects on a quarterly basis once they remain compliant with their contractual obligations to the Department.  The indicative allocations are set out in the table.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_7159">I propose to take Questions Nos. 798 and 800 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7160">My reply will deal with matters which are the direct responsibility of my Department but not with elements that relate to the decentralisation programme generally or to matters, such as property acquisition or disposal or planning, which are the responsibility of other Ministers.  In this regard, the House will note the reply today of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, to related Questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7161">To date, 76 of the 140 staff of my Department originally due to relocate to Co. Mayo have transferred to an interim location in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo.  The equivalent number at 31 December 2006 was 70.  It is planned to increase the number at the interim location to just over 100 from March 2008. It was originally planned that my Department's headquarters would relocate to Knock Airport, Co. Mayo, but An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission for that location. In July 2007 the Government decided on Charlestown, Co Mayo, as the new location for my Department's headquarters. The Office of Public Works is in negotiations for the purchase of a site at that location and it is not possible at this juncture to say precisely when the new headquarters will be ready.</p>
            <p eId="para_7162">The Department has fulfilled its decentralisation commitments in relation to Na Forbacha, Galway, with 10 officers in place in temporary accommodation there. The equivalent number at 31 December 2006 was 8. Permanent accommodation was planned to be in place early in 2007 but is now expected to be ready in mid-2008.  Pobal have filled 25 of the 40 posts due to decentralise to Clifden, Co. Galway, in temporary accommodation. The equivalent number at 31 December 2006 was 21.  Permanent accommodation is expected to be in place in the last quarter of 2009. At that stage it is envisaged that all 40 posts will be located there.</p>
            <p eId="para_7163">In relation to Foras na Gaeilge, 5 posts have been identified as an initial decentralisation tranche from within the overall complement of 30 posts to be relocated in Gaoth Dobhair. I am hopeful that the necessary approvals can be processed so that these 5 posts will be filled in the course of 2008.  The provision of suitable accommodation is being pursued by the Office of Public Works and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Non-property costs incurred by my Department to end-July amounted to €817,467.  To date the Office of Public Works has also incurred costs of about €650,000 in relation to accommodation for my Department's decentralisation programme.  Originally, 2 staff members were involved in full-time administration of the decentralisation process in my Department, reducing to 1 in January 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_7166">Pobal have filled 25 posts in Clifden, Co. Galway. The posts concerned were in respect of new business and all posts, except 1, were filled by way of local recruitment. The remaining 15 positions due to relocate will be filled in Clifden, again by local recruitment, when a permanent building is in place. This is expected in late 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_7172">I have had no contact with Commissioner Borg on this matter as this is primarily a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Community Support Scheme, recommended by the Report of the Independent Group, has been drafted to focus primarily on those communities where commercial salmon fishing has been a well-established activity and where its withdrawal demonstrably impacts on the economic and social fabric, for example, Gaeltacht areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7173">The scheme is to be administered by the LEADER companies under the supervision of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DCRGA).  Details of the scheme will be announced shortly.   Available funds will be allocated to those affected fishery districts, proportionate to the impact of the cessation of the mixed stock fishery.  Consultations with the LEADER companies, conducted through DCRGA, also informed the most effective distribution of funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_7174">The coastal communities concerned will also benefit from schemes for the sustainable development of fisheries and aquaculture, which are being put in place in the line with the recommendations of the Cawley Report — Steering A New Course.

            <p eId="para_7179">I propose to take Questions Nos. 805 and 883 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7180">Ireland has been free of rabies since 1903 and, until 2004, operated a control system based on compulsory six months quarantine for all imported cats and dogs, other than those imported from the U.K.  This was replaced by an EU wide system in 2004, under which dogs and cats can travel into Ireland without quarantine provided that certain conditions are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_7181">Pet dogs and cats can now travel directly into Ireland provided that:</p>
            <p eId="para_7182">The animal is travelling from an eligible country.  The USA is included in the list of eligible countries</p>
            <p eId="para_7183">The animal is identified by means of a microchip.</p>
            <p eId="para_7184">The animal has been vaccinated against rabies</p>
            <p eId="para_7185">The animal has, at least 6 months before entry into Ireland, been successfully blood-tested for rabies anti-bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_7186">The animal has been correctly treated against tick and tapeworm. These requirements are applied to all dogs and cats.</p>
            <p eId="para_7187">My Department facilitates travellers with guide dogs in any way possible consistent with protecting our rabies status. It will be appreciated that the controls are in place for sound scientific reasons and are designed to guard against this very serious disease entering the country.  Pets entering Ireland by air must normally fly only into Dublin airport and must travel as manifested cargo.  However, for guide dogs, these requirements are waived, and entry checks are carried out at the airport rather than in the quarantine station.</p>
            <p eId="para_7188">In this particular case I understand that the blood sample for the rabies anti-bodies test was taken on 22 December 2007.  This being the case the dog will be eligible to enter Ireland without quarantine after 21 June 2008. After that date the animal will be able to exit and re-enter the country at will, once vaccinations are kept up to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_7190">The position is that Single Payment entitlements were established for farmers who were farming and in receipt of direct payments under the Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002 and who continued to farm in 2005.  The person named did not receive payments under the Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid Schemes during the reference years and therefore no Single Payment entitlements were established for him.  The person named applied for entitlements from the 2005 National Reserve but as he was not a registered herdowner the application was rejected.</p>
            <p eId="para_7191">The person named applied under Category B of the 2006 National Reserve. Category B catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  In order to be eligible for an allocation of entitlements from the National Reserve a herdowner must submit a Single Payment Scheme application form. As the person named did not submit a 2006 Single Payment Scheme application form he was therefore not eligible for an allocation of entitlements from the 2006 National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_7192">The person named subsequently submitted an appeal against my Department's decision.  This appeal was forwarded to the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who completed their review and they have upheld my Department's decision.  A letter outlining the decision of the Committee issued to the person named.  The question of a 2008 National Reserve will be considered by the Single Payment Advisory Committee (comprising representatives of the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department) who will make a recommendation to me in due course.  In the meantime the person named should ensure that he submits a completed Single Payment application to my Department by the closing date of 15 May 2008.  Blank application forms will shortly be available in my Department's Local Offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_7252">The Animal Welfare, Recording and Breeding Scheme for Suckler Herds aims to encourage and underpin the adoption of high levels of animal welfare and improve the quality of the national beef herd.  Provided it is a beef breed, farmers are free to choose the type of bull they use in their herds as this does not deflect from the aims of the scheme.  The scheme has seven measures and compliance with these measures, regardless of the type of bull used, should result in enhanced welfare and quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_7253">My Department had consultations with ICBF regarding the extension of their recording programme to cover the objectives of the scheme. As the Animal Events system operated by ICBF is an integral part of the Scheme, a number of consultations took place on how the scheme would be rolled out to farmers.  The scheme will improve quality in the beef herd in a number of ways. A core part of the scheme is the collection of valuable breeding data on animals from a large range of farms. The central analysis of this data by ICBF will lead to accurate profit based breeding indexes on beef cattle in the country. These indexes will show in a clear and easily understandable manner the most profitable bulls to use on farms, whether they are pedigree or not. They will also allow farmers to identify the cows that are producing the most profitable and best quality weanlings.</p>
            <p eId="para_7254">The training and education module element of the scheme will provide practical knowledge for farmers on many aspects of quality beef production. The other measures relating to welfare improvement, and best practice on weaning will also contribute to improving the health and quality of animals being produced from the Suckler herd.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_7259">I propose to take Questions Nos. 821 to 824, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7260">My Department and a number of other relevant State agencies have invested very considerable public resources in terms of personnel and laboratory analysis on the farm in question, and continue to do so. The farm has been the subject of investigation over a number of years and is currently the subject of a further thorough and comprehensive investigation, which I commissioned the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) at UCD to undertake, at an estimated cost of up to €0.5 million.  In 2004, my Department's Veterinary Laboratory Service arranged for a wide-ranging study to be undertaken into the problems on the farm. A report was produced in June 2006, at which stage I met a delegation of interests, including the farmer in question, and confirmed my Department's willingness to continue to seek to establish the root cause of the on-farm problems and to which end I commissioned the current CVERA investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7261">The earlier report outlined the range of investigations conducted and concluded that, while there were obvious animal health problems on the farm, they had failed to establish that the environmental impact of emissions from a neighbouring factory, particularly fluoride, was sufficient to cause significant pollution or the animal health problems on the farm.  During the earlier studies, my Department carried out a number of elective and general post-mortem examinations on a number of animals from the farm and the results were provided in the 2006 Report.  In December 2007 two further elective post-mortems were carried out and the results of these will be included in the report to be completed following the current investigation.  During the course of the CVERA study of the animals on the farm apparent damage to the foliage in some of the hedgerows was observed. My officials reported this to the EPA and the matter was investigated by them. I understand that their findings will be included in the CVERA report currently in preparation, though the Deputy will appreciate that issues of environmental damage and any suggestions of a violation of EU law in relation to air pollution and contamination are not the responsibility of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7262">The CVERA study, which commenced in late 2006, is designed to complement much of the work done to date and applies some different approaches to investigate the production problems on the farm.  Among the elements of this robust, scientific study is a major sampling and testing programme, as well as epidemiological studies and investigations into the competency of different metabolic pathways.  In addition, it includes a comprehensive and detailed soil survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_7263">While the application of live biopsies and the possibility of digestibility studies had been discussed with the farmer concerned and before the current study had been formulated, the scientists concluded that the liver biopsies could add nothing further to our knowledge above and beyond what was already being provided by the exhaustive blood analysis programme and post-mortem examinations. The digestibility studies were intended to be undertaken during a downturn in the winter feeding trial (when inputs and outputs could be carefully monitored). In the event no downturn arose during this period and the animals performed normally.</p>
            <p eId="para_7264">A considerable amount of the sampling and testing has already been carried out and, as the study is being conducted to the highest scientific standards, there can be no question of its timescale for its completion being dictated by any other events.  I hope that, when the full range of test results have been collated and analysed and the appropriate scientific conclusions drawn, further light will be shed on the problems experienced on that farm.  Pending that conclusion, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to speculate on its outcome.</p>

A total of €350 million was provided for farm waste and other on-farm investment measures, of which €79 million was provided for the Farm Improvement Scheme. I indicated, at the time of its launch, that the Scheme would be terminated when this financial ceiling had been reached and this was also specifically provided for in the terms and conditions of the Scheme.</p>

This section continues in force the obligations that were contained in the repealed legislation.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 and the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 set out the framework for the regulation of sea fisheries and the enforcement of sea fisheries law and sea food safety law.  Sea Fisheries are managed and regulated under the EU Common Fisheries Policy.  The Acts provide the national framework for implementation and compliance with that policy.  The Deputy may also wish to note that an amendment to the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 and the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 was included in Criminal Justice Act 2007, which was sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

Many of the Plans found evidence of over-grazing by sheep and recommended reductions in flock numbers.  These reductions were applied incrementally, and no farmer was required to reduce his or her flock by more than 60%.  It is a condition of REPS 4, however, that a participant must destock to the full extent specified in the Commonage Framework Plans.</p>

In order to draw down full payment in respect of standard entitlements held, an applicant must declare an "eligible hectare" to accompany each entitlement.  In that regard an advance payment for €171.88 issued on 19 November 2007, based on the 18.51 hectares declared.  A balancing payment for €171.90 issued on 3 December 2007.

Following initial processing, it was found that one of the parcels listed on the application appeared to be over-claimed by the applicant.  The person named was informed of the over-claim on this land parcel on 6 November 2007 and following subsequent correspondence and telephone conversations with the applicant it was established that there was an overlap between the parcel declared by the applicant and a land parcel claimed as forestry by another person under the Afforestation Aid Scheme.  The person named contacted my Department on 21 January 2008 and stated that the overlap with the forestry parcel was incorrect and that the parcel of land declared by him was available to him in its entirety as forage.  At this time the person named was informed that my Department had no alternative but to arrange for an inspection to clarify the matter and the applicant agreed to this approach.  Payments will issue in respect of the Disadvantaged Area Scheme and the Single Payment Scheme 2007 when the eligibility of all the land on the application has been established.

            <p eId="para_7337">Where accommodation by way of pens or hutches is provided outdoors for calves, the application of good animal husbandry practices is essential to ensure their good health and welfare.  The use of confined individual pens (rebuilt or brought into use after 1 January 1998) for calves after the age of eight weeks is prohibited.  Calves up to eight weeks of age, when kept in individual pens, must have direct visual and tactile contact with other calves unless a veterinary practitioner requires the animal to be individually isolated to receive treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_7510">Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2007 lays down the legislative framework for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).  The Regulation establishes a European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, from which measures such as the Single Farm Payment, Export Refunds and Market Intervention are funded, and a European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, from which co-funding is provided for measures such as REPS, the Early Retirement Scheme, the Farm Improvement Programme and the Installation Aid Scheme.  Detailed mechanisms for the operation of the funds are set out in the Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_7511">Discussions on the original Commission proposal for the Regulation commenced at a Council Working Group in October 2004 which was attended by officials in my Department.  Political agreement was reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in May 2005.  In accordance with normal practice, I represented Ireland at the Council on that occasion.  As the overwhelming balance of interest for Ireland and other Member States lay in ensuring that there is a sound regulatory framework underpinning the management of EU funding for the CAP into the future, I supported the final proposal which was agreed by a qualified majority of Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_7512">A proposal to amend the Regulation was agreed at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in October 2007.  The amendment strengthened a number of the financial control mechanisms in the original Regulation and incorporated a requirement which had already been included in the General Budget Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1605/2002) to publish details of the beneficiaries of EU funds.  On this occasion, while supportive of the Commission's efforts to strengthen financial control procedures, I abstained in the vote on the basis of concerns about the publication of details of CAP payments.  The proposal was approved by the Council by qualified majority vote.  My Department does not participate in the deliberations of the European Parliament.</p>

It is estimated that the measure will be worth over €6 million annually or €42 million over the next seven years.  In order to ensure that the maximum number of eligible sheep farmers would benefit from this measure, my Department had sent application forms to sheep farmers who, according to Department records, might qualify under the measure.  This has resulted in the receipt of some 9,000 completed application forms.  Allocations to successful applicants have commenced this week and will continue over the coming weeks.

However, the over-claim has resulted in an over-declaration of greater than 20% of the eligible forage area found for the purposes of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.

            <p eId="para_7528">The position is that there will always be occasions when livestock farmers will have or will share a right of way.   I have no legal authority to interfere in, alter, limit or extinguish such a right.  The creation, alteration and extinguishment of private rights of way are primarily a civil issue. The persons exercising a right of way are required to do so within the limits and/or restrictions of the right of way for whatever purpose as granted to them and also the user must respect the rights of user as exercised by the fee simple owner over the right of way, if any.</p>
            <p eId="para_7529">With regard to the movement of cattle, the fundamental principle of non-co-mingling of animals from different herds, so that animals are not exposed to additional disease risk or do not facilitate the spread of disease between animals or herds, is a requirement that must be observed by all parties who might use a right of way.  In any event, good farming practice should dictate that two or more farmers should not use or walk livestock on a right of way at the same time.  If it comes to the attention of my Department that herds have co-mingled, it will be necessary to assign the lowest disease status to all such herds.  This could be to the detriment of the farmers concerned as they may not be able to trade or sell their livestock. This is primarily a matter for discussion and resolution by the parties concerned, save that I may be obliged to intervene if any breaches of animal legislation occur.</p>

            <p eId="para_7531">There are a considerable number of cross-Border cooperation arrangements between shellfish producers on the island of Ireland.  The CLAMS Process (Coordinated Local Management Scheme) is a nationwide initiative and is also in operation in Northern Ireland to manage the development of aquaculture in bays and inshore waters at a local level. It allows for the integration of aquaculture into the coastal zone, whilst recognising the need to improve environmental compliance, product quality and consumer confidence. There are now 18 CLAMS groups established around the coast of Ireland. This process is jointly operated under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural development and the Loughs Agency.  The ECOPACT Initiative is an all island environmental management system (EMS) initiative which caters for the specialist needs of the Irish aquaculture industry and in particular, the shellfish producers.  The Irish Quality Mussel and Irish Quality Oyster Schemes are a suite of third-party accredited product quality assurance schemes open to all farmed shellfish producers on the island of Ireland.  They are accredited to the EN45011 Standard and are policed by an independent third-party certification body.</p>
            <p eId="para_7532">The Loughs Agency has responsibility for aquaculture development in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  This is a cross-Border body as provided for in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and established by the North/South Ministerial Council.   By the end of 2008 it will have responsibility for licensing aquaculture production on a cross border basis in both Loughs.  This will include shellfish production.  The Aquaculture Initiative (EEIG) is a specialist cross-Border aquaculture development and facilitation body, jointly managed by Department of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Food, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Northern Ireland Seafoods.  The Aquaculture Initiative deals with shellfish producers on both sides of the Border covering a remit area of the 6 counties of Northern Ireland and the 6 adjoining counties of the Republic of Ireland.  The management of mussel seed uptake is managed under joint arrangements involving my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Loughs Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_7533">A review of the current arrangements has recently been undertaken and I am currently examining this report.  There is a cross-Border oyster marketing company called Irish North Coast Oyster Company Ltd. (INCO) which was established with assistance from Co-operation Ireland with a view to encouraging collective marketing and sales of oysters farmed by producers both sides of the Border.  All of the above initiatives and actions are operated on the basis of assisting shellfish producers on both sides of the Border.</p>

            <p eId="para_7552">The total package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime was worth in excess of €310m to Ireland. The former beet growers are beneficiaries under all three elements of the package.</p>
            <p eId="para_7553">The first element is the compensation for the reduction in the minimum price of beet, which has been already incorporated in the Single Payment with effect from 2006.  It is worth approximately €123m to Irish beet growers over seven years.  The second element is the EU restructuring aid worth €145m to Ireland.  Three parties benefit from this aid: the sugar processor, former beet growers and machinery contractors.  In 2007, the High Court found against the Government's original decision on the percentage of the aid to be reserved for the growers and contractors and a new Government decision will be made shortly. However, by agreement with the parties, the first instalment of 40% (€58m) was paid in June 2007, including over €12m to the growers. Subject to the new Government decision, the balance of the aid will be paid in February 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7554">Subsequent to the High Court ruling, there has been an increase in the overall amount of restructuring aid available to Ireland, resulting from an amending EU regulation in October 2007 aimed at making the restructuring aid more attractive for the future. The benefits under the new regulation will apply retroactively to Ireland and the additional payments will issue in June 2008. Under the original Government decision, the growers would have received €40m of restructuring aid but, as a result of the amending EU regulation, which fixed an additional payment for the growers, the total amount to be paid to them will amount to approx €53m regardless of the new Government decision to be made shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7555">The third element of the package is the diversification aid worth almost €44m to Ireland.  The first tranche of €22m was paid out to former beet growers in September 2007.  The manner and timing of payment of the second tranche is the subject of discussions with the EU Commission.</p>

Of the employees that responded to the survey, 4.1% indicated that they had a disability as defined under the 2005 Act. This information is reported on in the National Disability Authority (NDA) 2006 Report On Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 On Employment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service.  As regards 2007, my Department will shortly undertake a census of staff to establish disability status as defined by the  Disability Act 2005.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7619">I propose to take Questions Nos. 890 and 892 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7620">FETAC does not accredit trainers as individuals, but does approve training institutions and awards. The process is two-fold: firstly a centre or institution must agree its overall quality assurance arrangements with FETAC in compliance with published criteria, and then the actual programme of education or training being offered, including how it is to be assessed,  is submitted for validation by the Council. These processes are designed to ensure that providers are capable of offering quality awards at the appropriate standard, and that assessment of learners is fair and consistent.  When this has been done, the learners who successfully complete such programmes and satisfy the assessment criteria are eligible for FETAC awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_7621">To date in excess of 600 providers of further education and training, incorporating over 1,300 separate centres, have agreed their quality assurance arrangements  with FETAC and can offer programmes leading to FETAC awards at Levels 1 to 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7622">FETAC accredits an extensive range of vocational awards designed to prepare learners for employment as operators and craft workers across a range of occupations in the business, tourism, catering, construction, IT, multimedia, sport and recreation, marketing, international trade, travel, art craft and design, community care, childcare, and industrial and service sectors. In addition to these awards, there are a number of general awards which are appropriate to business and enterprise development — for example Start Your Own Business,  Enterprise Development, eBusiness, Business Studies, Business Administration and Management,  Strategic Customer Relations Management, Business Appraisal, are all current awards which are validated by FETAC.  The modular format of FETAC awards (a number of minor awards leading to a major award in a particular area) allows for flexibility for learners  in achieving  qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7623">FETAC has also  established a Standards Advisory Board, and is setting up Standard Development Groups to develop awards and standards in the future. These provide for representation from a range of stakeholders across education, training, industry and professional bodies  in the development of standards and awards. In addition, any provider, in an education or training institution in the public or private sector, or in a workplace or community setting, may submit a new programme or award for validation.  In this way FETAC is well placed to identify and respond to changing demands from industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_7624">It should be noted that under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, FETAC is not a direct provider of education and training. Rather, it responds to applications from providers in the public and private sector who seek to have their programmes validated in accordance with the policies and criteria set out by the Council.  The development of programmes is a function of providers.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7626">I am aware that reports have highlighted some difficulties regarding the recognition of migrants' qualifications, and indicate that many highly skilled migrants work in occupations demanding lower levels of skill.</p>
            <p eId="para_7627">EU Directive 2005/36/EC on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications enables  professionals qualified in another Member State to  seek recognition of their qualifications and/or experience in Ireland for the purpose of practising their profession.  This Directive applies only where the profession is regulated i.e. where the practice of the profession is confined by law, regulation or administrative procedure to persons who hold specific qualifications, or registration/recognition from a specific competent authority or professional body.  If a profession is not regulated in the State then recognition of a qualification in terms of gaining employment is a matter for the prospective employer.  However, the normal obligations under equality legislation would apply in such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_7628">The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland  has established Qualifications Recognition — Ireland, a one stop shop for enquiries regarding the recognition of awards from other countries, whether for purposes of the regulated professions, for employment or for access and progression to further or higher education and training. Applicants can complete the application on line, but this needs to be accompanied by a certified copy of the award, a certified copy of the transcript, and certified translations of these documents into Irish or English. The NQAI then refers the documentation to the appropriate bodies for advice, building on its extensive networks with European national contact points and information centres relating to education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_7629">The information provided by Qualifications Recognition — Ireland is advisory in nature. It is based on the award documentation presented by the applicant.  No advice can be issued regarding a foreign qualification where there is no comparable Irish award type. In addition, advice cannot be provided on the comparability of an award where it is gained in, or issued by, an institution that is not recognised within its home jurisdiction as providing awards that are quality assured.</p>
            <p eId="para_7630">The recognition service is offered free of charge (although applicants must cover the cost of translating their application documents) and is available to individuals, employers public bodies etc. A leaflet entitled "Qualifications Matter" which outlines the service is available upon request and is also available in Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian and Russian.</p>
            <p eId="para_7631">The numbers availing of the service are increasing, but those seeking advice reflect only a small proportion of migrant workers in Ireland. The availability of the service has been publicised through contacts, conferences and information provided to migrant groups organisations, employers and education and training providers.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7640">Existing education policy is that students up to 18 years of age are admitted to primary and second level schools irrespective of their nationality or status. Indeed, under the Equal Status Act, schools may not discriminate in admission to schools except where this is necessary to maintain the religious values or ethos of the school. While the Act does provide for differential treatment in relation to fees for further and higher education for persons who are not nationals of an EU Member State, there is no such condition specified in regard to second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7641">The admission of persons to the State from outside the EU is a matter for the immigration authorities. Children of refugees, those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, asylum seekers and dependents of certain work permit holders, are entitled to access free first and second level education. However, the basic conditions for a student visa require that the student attend a full time programme of education and training, pay the appropriate fees and be financially self supporting. Such students have no entitlements to bring their dependents with them to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7642">The Report on the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Internationalisation of Irish Education, published in 2004, set out a strategy with the objective of enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a quality venue for international students and increasing the numbers of students coming to Ireland to participate in further and higher education and training and in the language sector. It was envisaged that students from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland, other than refugees and those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, would participate on a fee paying basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7643">In the course of the discussions leading to the Report, the position of minors attending school for second level education was discussed, and the existing immigration policy that student visas should be allowed only in respect of attendance at fee-paying schools was confirmed, on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7644">In overall discussions with the immigration authorities in regard to student visas at second level, my Department has made clear the requirements under the Equal Status Act, has stressed the need to take due account of the age and vulnerability of children who, while having no entitlement to remain in the State, may already be enrolled in schools in the Free Education Scheme, and the importance of completion of second level education to future life chances.</p>
            <p eId="para_7645">However, the case raised by the Deputy relates to the dependant of student visa holders from outside the EU, and is essentially a matter for the immigration authorities.</p>

The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7666">A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who were previously on Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.  The student ceases to receive a social welfare payment and, instead, receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of Jobseekers Benefit, plus payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate.  VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_7667">The allowances for VTOS students for meals and travel referred to in the question are equivalent to those paid to participants on FÁS training courses.  VTOS students may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre.  These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in FÁS rates.  There are no plans to increase them in the near future.  The rates since 2000 are outlined below:</p>

            <p eId="para_7683">Circular 0044/2007 requires that Irish medium schools should provide for a minimum provision in English of 2.5 hours per week for infant classes, no later than the start of the second term in Junior infants.  I fully discussed this issue with Irish language organisations and the National Parent's Council prior to issue of the Circular to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7684">The right of parents and children to choose education through the medium of Irish is fully respected, but this does not obviate the need for schools to implement all aspects of the national curriculum.  The achievement of the curriculum objectives in every curriculum area at each of the four levels of primary schooling is an over-riding requirement of all schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_7685">As the Deputy is aware the issue of Circular 0044/2007 is the subject of a legal challenge in the High Court, scheduled for 11 February 2008.  My Department is prohibited from  taking steps pursuant to implementation of the Circular until the judicial review has been heard and a final verdict has been given.</p>

            <p eId="para_7689">As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,700 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department's intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_7690">While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</p>
            <p eId="para_7691">There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department's building programme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_7692">The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools can be used again for future projects so that schools will not lose the expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_7773">The aim of my Department for Traveller education is to enable Travellers to participate in an equal manner with other service users through integrated educational mainstream provision.  I launched the Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy in November 2006.  The Report covers all aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The core principle of the report is one of inclusion with an emphasis on equality and diversity and the adoption of an intercultural approach.  This is in line with the Government's recommendations in the National Action Plan Against Racism (NAPAR) (2005).  The principle of "individual educational need" rather than "Traveller identity" will underpin future actions including allocation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_7774">Education is a key element in supporting greater Traveller participation and empowerment in our society.  The link between education, training and enterprise is perhaps the most vital in helping to increase the range of life choices that are available to Travellers.  A lifelong learning approach will focus on the journey from Pre-school to Primary, Post-Primary and on to employment or further education and training.  The key to success will be improvements in progression rates for Travellers to the end of Junior Cycle, on to Senior Cycle and from STTCs into further studies, training or employment.  The Department also recognises that for some adults seeking second chance education they may require short term positive affirmative actions to gain the skills and competences to transfer on and progress into mainstream education, training or employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7775">The Senior Traveller Training programme is a positive affirmative action by the Department of Education and Science which seeks to provide an opportunity for members of the Traveller community and other learners to: engage in a programme of learning that affirms their cultural identity; acquire the knowledge, skills and confidence to participate fully in society (Traveller community and settled community),	enhance their employability and progress to further education, training, employment or other life choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_7776">The target group is people who have left school with either minimal or no qualifications.  Particular effort is made to encourage parents on to the programme, given the impact this can have on their children's subsequent participation in mainstream primary and post-primary education.  The centres have been successful in imparting the essential skills of literacy, numeracy, social/life skills, woodwork, metalwork and home economics, among many others, for Travellers who have left school after primary level or who may not have gone to school at all. Many adult Travellers are now availing of second chance education in these centres.  They recognise the value education provides in the context of breaking the cycle of educational and social disadvantage that their community has experienced for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_7777">The full programme is two years long encompassing a foundation and a progression phase. In exceptional circumstances learners may attend the programme for three years, if for example they are completing the Leaving Certificate Applied.  After completing their programme in a STTC, a learner has the option of progressing on to other Further Education and training courses provided by the VEC or FÁS in their area. These courses may include the part time Back to Education Initiative, full time Post Leaving Certificate courese or they may chose from a number of FÁS options.  A learner during their time in the centre and on completion of a programme at a STTC, can avail of the Adult Educational Guidance service in a VEC to explore options in terms of progression to further education and training.  Travellers are encouraged to access mainstream literacy classes.  In addition nineteen VECs provide literacy classes specifically for Travellers.  In respect of the group referred to by the Deputy my department provides funds for Further and Adult Education which are disbursed through the Vocational Education Committees. Applications for support from this fund should be addressed directly to the VEC.</p>

         the differential in funding between all-girls schools, co-educational schools and all-boys schools; the reasons behind these differences in funding; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7784">There is no differential in funding provided by my Department to all-girl, co-educational and all-boy schools.  Primary school's running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants.  These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.  There are no proposals to change these arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_7785">The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years.  Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €178.58 with effect from 1st January, 2008.  This represents an increase of 212% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.  Enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457 to €880 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_7786">The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.  The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €151.50 per pupil.  This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving primary school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.  The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system.  At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_7787">My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.  There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools.  With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.  The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil.  These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services.  For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_7788">Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant.  All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.  These significant increases in the funding of post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.  My Department will be considering, in line with the Programme for Government commitment, how best to complete the process of equalisation of funding at second level.</p>

            <p eId="para_7791">I propose to take Questions Nos. 917 and 1035 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7792">The school referred to by the Deputy is one of 27 new schools to be provided under my Department's Public Private Partnership Programme (PPP) 2006 to 2010.  I have already announced the first two bundles of school projects comprising 4 schools in bundle 1 and 6 schools in Bundle 2.  The first bundle consists of four post-primary, two in Co. Laois and two in Co. Offaly is in procurement and will go to construction this year. The second bundle consists of six schools, 5 post-primary and 1 primary school in counties Cork, Limerick, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow are in pre procurement and will be offered to the market shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7793">The make up of further school bundles in my Department's PPP school building programme will be determined on such issues as geographic spread and site availability for each school.  I intend announcing further PPP project bundles during the year and the school referred to by the Deputies will be considered in this context.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1215">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7795">Firstly, the Department have not been responsible for any judicial review proceedings in the years 1997 to 2007 insofar as the Minister has not been an applicant in proceedings.  Of the proceedings in which the Minister was named as a respondent it may be noted that the cost to the State is borne by the Chief State Solicitor's Office in respect of counsel's fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_7796">Of the cases in which an applicant for judicial review has successfully obtained an order for costs against the Minister these are the subject of negotiation between the Costs Accounting Section of the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the applicant's legal representatives.  Under the provisions of Order 99 of the Rules of the Superior Courts a bill of costs may be the subject of review by the Taxing Master.  Further, costs paid in the period 1997-2007 may well relate to actions concluded in previous years.  Similarly costs incurred in the period 1997-2007 may not yet be the subject of final orders for costs for several years.  It may therefore be noted that the figures supplied below in relation to the number of cases in the time period concerned will bear little relation to the costs paid during that time period.</p>
            <p eId="para_7797">It is uncommon in judicial review cases for damages to be a remedy.  Generally an action taken pursuant to Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts seeks orders of certiorari or mandamus, i.e. to quash a particular decision or to compel the Minister to take a particular course of action.  Actions taken by plenary summons or personal injuries summons would be the more common route for damages to be pursued.  The figures below only relate to judicial review proceedings.  In many cases the Department has not been the sole respondent, i.e. cases may involve the provision of particular therapies or other resource allocation, and this may involve other Government Departments or agencies, e.g. the Department of Health &amp; Children or the HSE. In the circumstances the amounts mentioned are those which relate to this Department's contribution.  However, it was customary in the past for the Department to partially bear the costs of an child-related action even if the reliefs sought against the Minister for Education &amp; Science were not necessarily granted. In some cases, e.g. those relating to troubled minors, the education-related component is often not at issue between the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_7798">Over the period 1997-2007 a number of bodies have transferred from the Department of Education &amp; Science to other Government Departments and State Agencies, e.g. the National Coaching and Training Centre (NCTC) was transferred to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism; under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 the amended Children Act 2001 was commenced, the effect of which was the transfer of the children detention schools to the Irish Youth Justice Service and the HSE in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7799">In the circumstances the details of costs and damages provided below is generally indicitative of the judicial review proceedings in which my Department was named as a respondent.  It does not include actions in which the Department was named as a notice party, nor any actions taken by plenary summons.  The costs to which reference is made below are party-and-party costs, but information on any settlement costs are included where available, e.g. there are instances in which a particular financial allocation may be made on an ex-gratia basis to contribute towards an educational or other service sourced by the family of a litigant during the course of proceedings.  Any such amount would not constitute damages.  On the question of awards, it should be noted that, quite apart from court orders or court settlements, the court proceedings themselves can often involve a high level of non-legal costs, such as the extensive use of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), medical fees, witness expenses and so forth.  The overall litigation costs cited below may include similar non-legal costs if these were granted to the applicants over the course of the proceedings.  Generally however, judicial review cases are contested on the papers and unless there is a need to cross-examine the deponent of an affidavit then the matter of witness expenses should not arise.</p>

        <b>Deputy Damien English</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of applications for judicial review that her Department was responsible for in each of the years 1997 to 2007; the number of applications where leave was granted for each year; and if she will present the information in tabular readable form.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1216">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_7825">The Department has not been responsible for any applications for judicial review during the period in question.  The Minister has been named as a respondent in a considerable number of actions in the years 1997 to 2007.  However, it may be noted that leave to apply for judicial review is generally granted on an ex-parte basis, i.e. the Minister is not on notice of the application and thus does not have an opportunity to contest the granting of leave on an inter-parties basis.  However, in certain circumstances an interim relief given, such as injunctive relief, may be granted by a judge on the condition that the respondent have the opportunity to contest the interlocutory relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_7826">On occasion a High Court judge may well decide to refuse leave to apply for judicial review on the majority of the reliefs sought. For the purposes of the Deputy's statistics these cases would still count as those in which leave was granted.  The granting of leave to apply for judicial review is given at the threshold of ‘arguable/stateable case'.  It does not imply that there is necessarily any prospect of successfully quashing a Ministerial decision or the procedures and processes which gave rise to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_7827">In certain circumstances the Minister may be named as a respondent in a case in which the matters wholly relate to the exercise of a Board of Management's functions under section 15 of the Education Act 1998.  Whilst the Department, the NEWB and the Inspectorate offer assistance on the matter of codes of behaviour, admissions policies and related matters, and whilst the provisions of s.29 of the Education Act 1998 offer remedies short of High Court proceedings in situations in which refusal to enrol or permanent exclusion has arisen, it should be noted that the Minister can often be named in legal actions in which there is no basis upon which the reliefs sought could be successfully obtained against the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_7828">Similarly, the Minister may be named as a respondent in cases in which the principal reliefs sought are not of an educational nature, e.g. litigation relating to troubled minors may entail a broad range of state agencies, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Youth Justice Service and the Health Service Executive i.e. there are a diverse range of care needs to be addressed, and for which the educational dimension may not necessarily result in any relief being granted against the Department of Education and Science.  It may also be noted that, under the provisions of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 the management of personal injury and property damage claims were delegated to the State Claims Agency.  The State Claims Agency manages claims relating to community and comprehensive schools.  However, few of these actions are taken by way of judicial review.</p>
            <p eId="para_7829">Further, it may be noted that even if leave to apply for judicial review is granted by the High Court this may be set aside on appeal to the Supreme Court, without the substantive matters being heard at High Court level.  In the light of the foregoing the tabular information should be understood to include only those cases in which leave to apply for judicial review has been sought against the Minister. If the Deputy has a specific area of concern in mind, such as the primary or post-primary sectors, education-related industrial relations matters, residential institutions and abuse-related litigation, then this could be explored further.</p>

None of these Acts were wholly or mainly required by Ireland's EU obligations.  Generally the provisions of the European Communities Acts 1972-2007 would be the principal legal instrument through which Ministers make orders to give effect to EU Directives on various matters. In the education sector this has largely related to the transposition of Qualifications Directives over the past number of years, e.g. during the time period in question the European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications and Experience) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 372/2003) gave legal effect to Council Directive No. 99/42/EC of 7th June 1999.</p>

            <p eId="para_7869">The information on class sizes for the 2007/08 school year is currently being compiled by my Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.  Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_7870">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_7872">As the Deputy may be aware, the National Council for special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  The SENO is also a focal point of contact for parents and schools and their role includes identifying appropriate school placements.  My officials have been in contact with the NCSE and have been advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy is currently enrolled in a mainstream schooland is in receipt of 5 individual hours resource teaching per week as well as full time special needs assistant support.</p>
            <p eId="para_7873">I am informed that the parents have applied to enrol their child in a special school and are awaiting a decision on the application from the Board of Management of the school.  I also understand that the local SENO is actively involved in the case.  I wish to advise the Deputy that the matter of the enrolment of a pupil in a school including a special school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school and my Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>

            <p eId="para_7877">Section 52 of the Universities Act 1997 prohibits the use of the terms ‘University' where the organisation is  engaged in the provision of education services unless the Minister for Education and Science consents to the use of the term.  Approval has not been given for the use of the term "university" in the title of the institution referred to in the question and my Department has contacted the body concerned on a number of occasions, explaining the legislative requirement for such approval and requesting them to desist from the use of the term "university" in its title.</p>
            <p eId="para_7878">The existence of organisations of the type referred to by the Deputy is contrary to the interests of Ireland's higher education institutions, which have sought to preserve the high international standing and reputation for quality which our system enjoys. In this regard a number of steps have been taken to prevent the unauthorised use of the term "university".</p>
            <p eId="para_7879">Following an approach from my Department the Companies Registration Office has put in place a procedure whereby any business name applied for which features the term "university" will not be accepted without the express approval of my Department.  The Irish Domain Registry has also agreed not to register web addresses containing the term "university" without reference to the Department.  Officials of my Department and the relevant agencies are considering a number of other options, including the scope for legal action, with a view to strengthening the Department's position in dealing with such commercial organisations.</p>

            <p eId="para_7900">The determination of waste charges is a matter for the waste service provider, whether a local authority or a private service provider.  The cost pressures on schools are taken into account by my Department in determining the levels of annual increases in the capitation grants paid to schools to meet their day to day running costs. Primary schools are now getting €178 per pupil to meet their day to day running costs — an increase of nearly 70% on the 2002 rate of €105 and €15 more per child than they got last year.  Post-primary schools get €331 per pupil. As the Deputy will be aware, we are committed to doubling the capitation grant for primary schools over the next five years</p>

This drawdown contract facility is aimed at providing school accommodation in very short timescales using modern methodologies such as off-site construction.  Contracts for the provision of the schools will be placed shortly.  This method of building procurement,  teamed with close co-operation with the relevant local authorities, will help ensure that additional school places are provided in the developing areas within the earliest possible timeframes.</p>

            <p eId="para_7958">I can confirm that there have been four meetings between the Department of Education and Science and Fingal County Council under the aegis of the Planning Coordinating Committee for the Fingal Model Agreement.  However, there is extensive communication on an ongoing basis in relation to issues relating to specific sites.  Furthermore, a number of sites being acquired under the Fingal School Model are at varying stages of acquisition and, as the Deputy will appreciate, due to commercial sensitivities relating to site acquisition, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_7959">As the Deputy is aware, the Department and Fingal County Council agreed to develop a new model of partnership for providing school and community facilities.  Under the terms of the Fingal School Agreement, the local authority has undertaken to identify and acquire appropriate sites for schools, as recommended by this Department.  In return, the design of the schools on these sites will be varied to meet community needs identified by the Council.  This enhanced cooperation has the effect of minimising the Department's land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.  The range of enhanced combination facilities can include large sports halls, stage and dressing rooms, community meeting rooms, all-weather pitches and playgrounds.  These additional facilities, which will be over and above the Department's standard specifications for schools, will be available not only to the school during normal school hours but also to the local community in the evenings, at weekends and during school holidays. It is intended that this model will be used in Fingal to deliver approximately 20 schools in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_7961">I can confirm that the Department is in receipt of an application for major capital funding from the school to which the Deputy refers.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and has been assigned a band 2 rating.  Technical reports are part of normal internal procedures carried out by the Department and they are not generally made available to schools.  Therefore, the release or otherwise of a report has no bearing on when a project proceeds.  Progress on individual projects is dependent on the Band Rating assigned to it which will reflect the fact that a school is in a rapidly developing area if this is the case.  Progress on the project in question will, therefore, be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme consistent with its Band Rating.</p>

            <p eId="para_7967">As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,700 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department's intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_7968">While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</p>
            <p eId="para_7969">In the circumstances, there will not be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department's building programme in 2008.  This being the case, details in relation to the number of applications received and cost have not been collated by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_7970">The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_8370">As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,700 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department's intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_8371">While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.  Capitation grants at post primary level are intended to cover necessary minor works.</p>

            <p eId="para_8373">The Government's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation is a multi annual, multi-billion euro investment in research and development activity for the period to 2013. The Strategy aims to see Ireland secure its position as one of the world's advanced knowledge economies and become renowned worldwide for the excellence of its research.</p>
            <p eId="para_8374">Central to this will be the development of the capacity of our higher education system for the achievement of key targets during the lifetime of the Strategy such as doubling the number of PhD graduates, attaining the necessary intellectual critical mass, advancing the quality of our post-graduate and PhD training, strengthening arrangements for industry collaboration and providing all the necessary supporting structures to achieve the research objectives of a range of sectors. The growth of fourth level education under the strategy will have a major impact on the profile of our higher education institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8375">My Department provides significant annual funding to support the development of research activities in our third level institutions. In 2008 an amount of €106 million in recurrent funding is being provided together with €94.3 million in capital funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_8376">The purpose and function of funding support in this context is to develop research capability and capacity in the Higher Education System, as a whole. It is not focused on specific institutions or regions. Allocations for research activities are, in the main, made as a result of independent evaluation and ultimately selected on the basis of the quality of the submitted proposal when matched against the criteria specified in the call for proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_8418">The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_8419">My Department provides funding to secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_8420">There have been significant improvements in recent years in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. With effect from January 2008, the standard per capita grant was increased by €15 per pupil and now amounts to €331 per pupil. In addition, voluntary secondary schools have benefited by the increase of €15 per pupil in 2008 in the support services grant bringing that grant to €204 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_8421">The cumulative increase of €30 per pupil in a voluntary secondary school brings the aggregate grant to €535 per pupil. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is also provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. For example in the case of a secondary school with 500 pupils, this brings annual grants towards general expenses and support service to over €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_8422">Budget allocations for schools in the Community and Comprehensive school sector along with those in the VEC sector are increased on a pro rata basis with increases in the per capita grant. All schools are eligible for recurrent per capita grants towards special classes and curricular support grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_8423">The funding mechanisms in place afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of their resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.

            <p eId="para_8427">As the Deputy may be aware, the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004.  Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of €300 million have been completed. Considerable extra investment has been provided in the Budget to increase funding for school buildings to almost €600 million this year.   With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I am focusing on delivering as many large scale projects as possible in 2008. There is not, therefore, a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8441">Schools have also been asked to ensure that, with effect from the current school year, the results of testing are reported to parents in respect of their own children in accordance with a broader reporting template, designed to report  progress on children's learning to parents.  This template is being finalised by the NCCA and will be available very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_8442">There is widespread acceptance of the value of standardised testing as one of a range of modes of assessment that help teachers to make more informed decisions in relation to teaching and learning. The results of standardised tests can be used to inform parents of pupils' progress and to assist in the identification of pupils that may require support.  While the results of standardised testing will not be reported by schools to the Department, they will be made available to inspectors conducting evaluations. However, the results of these tests will not be aggregated at Department level nor will inspectors make references to test data in their reports in any way which would facilitate the compilation of league tables.</p>
            <p eId="para_8443">The programme of standardised testing is complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring targeted at:</p>

            <p eId="para_8555">My Department is reviewing renewable options for energy generation in schools through a number of research projects including, Tory wind turbine project, INTERREG solar hot water heating projects and Biomass wood pellet / wood chip boiler and solar projects. The Tory Island project involves the supply and installation of two wind turbines to provide electrical energy to serve the existing community facility and Vocational School situated on Tory Island.</p>
            <p eId="para_8556">My Department would encourage schools to consider the use of wind generated electricity which is available nationally through the National Grid. This in effect allows the school to benefit from the environmental and lower cost benefits of wind generated electricity without being exposed to operating and maintenance issues and reliability of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_8557">With respect to energy programmes that would compliment environmental work currently taking place under the green flags initiative for the past nine years the Planning and Building Unit within my Department have been using a process called the DART approach (Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology) to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. The policy is driven by technical guidance documents, informed by building unit professional and technical staff, external partnerships and updated by continued energy research and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_8558">Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design my Department has taken a more holistic approach and have developed their technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents. These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception.</p>
            <p eId="para_8559">The incorporation of low energy design has been done on a hybrid basis by maximising natural resources and utilising technologies. This involves focusing on areas such as natural ventilation, passive solar design, day lighting and reducing infiltration, enhanced insulation, lighting and heating controls and water efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_8560">The focus to date on sustainability in schools has been to reduce the energy demand in schools. This has proven quite successful with modern day schools typically using three times less energy than schools built ten years ago and also using less than half the energy than what is termed as good international practice for schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_8589">As the Deputy will be aware, the Summer Works Scheme has, since its introduction just a few years ago, transformed the standard of existing school accommodation. With over 3,700 projects now having been funded under the scheme, the Department's intention is to concentrate the investment in school buildings this year on delivering as many large projects as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_8590">While there will be a focus on providing extra places in developing areas, the Department will also be delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. The emphasis, however, will be on new schools, extensions and major refurbishments, rather than on smaller projects.  At primary level schools may use their devolved minor works grant to address such works.</p>
            <p eId="para_8591">There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of the Department's building programme in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_8612">The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools' ICT Strategy. This strategy will be underpinned by the investment of €252m which is provided for in the National Development Plan 2007-2013. I appointed a Strategy Planning Group to advise me on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment over the period of the NDP. Among the issues which the new strategy will address are the upgrading and renewal of hardware, the provision of software and digital content for learning, teacher professional development, curriculum development, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools and technical maintenance and support requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8613">I have now received the report of the Strategy Planning Group and I will shortly be publishing the report, together with my implementation plan.   This new investment will build on the investment made in the integration of ICT into teaching and learning since the introduction of the ICT in Schools Programme in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_8614">As the Deputy will be aware, the recent priorities under the Programme have been the development of schools' internal networking facilities and the provision of broadband connectivity for schools, which my Department has pursued in partnership with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation within IBEC. Over 140,000 training places have been provided for teachers to improve their ICT skills and assist them to integrate ICT into their teaching practice, while ICT has been included within the pre-service training provided by our teaching training providers. Scoilnet has been developed as a comprehensive resource for teachers and students and a range of relevant digital content has been created specifically to complement the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_8615">The provisional figure for expenditure by my Department under the ICT in Schools Programme in 2007 is some €11.5m.   Specifically in relation to primary schools, I would also mention that since 2006, the Grant Scheme for Minor Works to National School properties includes ICT equipment within the range of approved school expenditure.  Disadvantaged primary schools are also benefiting from the ICT Grant Scheme for DEIS Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_8624">As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation system was introduced in May 2005, under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8625">The general allocation system means that rather than schools having to make individual applications to this Department for resources for such pupils, resources are provided in advance to the school. The school attended by the pupil referred to by the Deputy has been allocated 0.86 teaching posts (22.5 hours) to provide for the educational needs of the pupils with high incidence special needs and learning support needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8626">The board of management may decide how these hours are divided among the pupils in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some pupils with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource/learning support teachers to work with pupils in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the pupils then have to catch up on work done by the rest of the class in their absence.</p>
            <p eId="para_8627">My Department issued a comprehensive circular, SP ED 02/05 to schools which provides guidelines on the manner in which they should use the resources that have been allocated to them to best effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_8630">The request for recognition to which the Deputy refers is associated with an application from the organisation in question for inclusion in the Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) pilot programme which is funded by my Department. The pilot programme will not be expanded and applicant groups have been so advised.</p>
            <p eId="para_8631">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who have received additional training in autism, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_8632">In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level by my Department in conjunction with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), while more are being set up as required.  At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_8633">The pilot programme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government commits to the long-term funding for the centres that are currently in the ABA pilot programme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable the Department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. I am pleased to advise that the issue is being actively progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8634">In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_8640">In May 2007, I approved the issuing of Circular 53/2007 to the Managerial Authorities in primary and post primary schools. This circular outlines the resources available to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. I removed the limit of two Language Support Teachers per school and extended the provision of language support beyond two years, where a specific request is made. In fact, it is now possible for some schools with over 121 such pupils to have 6 language support teachers. There are now in over 1,900 language support teacher posts allocated to primary and post primary schools, compared with just 262 in 2001/2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_8641">These additional resources will assist in providing an inclusive school environment to meet the needs of pupils for whom English is a second language. Such an inclusive school environment reflects values and affirms linguistic, ethnic and cultural diversity.</p>
            <p eId="para_8642">In addition to the language resource teachers there is a significant amount of resources available including the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's (NCCA) Guidelines — "Intercultural Education in the Primary School" and "Intercultural Education in the Post- Primary school". The NCCA has also published "English as an Additional Language in Irish Primary Schools". Integrate Ireland Language and Training (IILT) has produced a resource book "Up and Away" for English language support in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8643">IILT in collaboration with the Southern Education and Library Board (in Armagh)  published a "Toolkit for diversity in the primary school — Together towards Inclusion". This was a joint North South project. It was completed in December 2007 and will be distributed to schools shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_8644">In addition, a language assessment kit, prepared by IILT, will be provided to all primary schools shortly. This will enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of newcomer children. It is proposed to have an assessment kit for post-primary schools available later in the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8648">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_8649">Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. Ongoing activities of the Board include the development of a Code of Behaviour and Attendance Strategies for Schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8650">The first national data on school attendance has been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings indicate that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved with the mean percentage of students absent 20 days or more having decreased by over 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year. The NEWB collects data for absences over 20 days.  The first year data was collected on an individual county basis was for the 2004/05 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8651">In relation to the Deputy's specific question relating to student absenteeism in the Cork region I am informed that data in the format requested is available from the 2004/2005 school year. The published data for 2004/05 indicates that 7.4% of primary pupils in Cork were absent for more than 20 days during that school year. The figure for post-primary pupils was 12.5% for the same period. These figures compare favourably with the national averages for pupils absent for more than 20 days (10% for primary and 18.8% at post primary level).  The 2005/06 data is currently being prepared by the NEWB for final publication and the 2006/2007 data has not yet been analysed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8652">This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.</p>

            <p eId="para_8671">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single statutory body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8672">An additional 15 staff was allocated to the NEWB in 2007. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8673">It should, however, be remembered that the service provided by the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs. In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). The SSP incorporating the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) is a preventative measure designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8674">This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that funding to the Board last year amounted to €9.808 million. This represented an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding gave a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. The allocation to the Board in 2008 is €10.119 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_8675">I will be keeping the issue of resources for the NEWB under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_8677">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 as the single statutory body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools. Therefore the provision of services to schools to address behaviour problems does not fall directly within the remit of the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_8678">The Deputy may be assured however that the Board operates in close liaison with the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and is developing working protocols to ensure interagency collaboration to address issues of behaviour that impact negatively on attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8679">My Department remains committed to the development of a strong and robust approach to dealing with the issue of student behavioural problems and has introduced significant measures over the recent years to address this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_8680">In early 2006, I announced an implementation strategy following publication of "School Matters" the Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools, and that strategy is now well advanced. At the core of the recommendations of the Task Force was the putting in place of a National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). The NBSS was established in 2006 with the appointment of a National Co-ordinator and five Assistant National Co-ordinators. In addition, ten Regional Development Officers and fourteen part-time Associates were recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative. A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a team of four psychologists. These have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multi-disciplinary way.</p>
            <p eId="para_8681">In addition all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_8682">It has always been the policy of NEPS, within the normal boundaries of finance and process, to endeavour to respond positively and flexibly to extraordinary need and circumstance as presented by school authorities on occasion and it is open to school Principals who have urgent needs for pupil assessment in excess of allocation to discuss the matter with the local NEPS Regional Director.</p>
            <p eId="para_8683">My Department is committed to supporting schools and I want to advise the Deputy that since its establishment the number of psychologists allocated to NEPS has trebled. Notwithstanding this and as I have previously announced my Department is committed to further increasing psychological services, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists working to support schools. Current numbers stand at 138 and it is my intention to expand psychologist numbers further to some 169 during 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_8690">The current allocation to the Board is €10.119 million and an additional 15 staff allocated to the NEWB in 2007 brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8691">In meeting its responsibility, the Board works with schools, families and other agencies and services to ensure that appropriate interventions are made. The needs of children vary considerably from those who are not attending school, to those for whom there is no school place while in other cases, placement in an alternative education programme like Youthreach may be more appropriate. In exceptional cases where difficulties arise with placement my Department sanctions home tuition hours to facilitate ongoing minimum education until a suitable long term solution is put in place by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_8692">The Board estimates that it works with about 10,000 cases per year involving students with reported school attendance difficulties. The reasons for non-attendance range from those children who experience a variety of problems that impact negatively on their attendance in school to cases which involve parents who fail to enrol their child in a school or to ensure their child's regular attendance at school. The Board have also informed me that the detailed data requested by the Deputy is not currently collected by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_8693">The Board also has particular responsibility under the Act in terms of children who are educated in settings outside of a recognised school. Under Section 14 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, parents of such children must apply to the Board to have their child registered and an assessment is then carried out. Such assessments are conducted in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department. The aim of the assessment is to ensure that each child receives at least "a certain minimum education" in the alternative.</p>
            <p eId="para_8694">This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. The service provided by the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. These include intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homeworkclubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8695">In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).</p>
            <p eId="para_8696">The School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) are preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a key component in convincing young people of the value of education. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with targeted interventions for children at risk of early school leaving through a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.</p>

The Department will subsequently extend this school to a full-size 24-classroom school with the full range of ancillary accommodation appropriate to a school of this size including a General Purpose Room for indoor PE activities and outdoor play areas.

            <p eId="para_8708">Participation rates by county are currently only available from national studies of new entrants to higher education. These have been commissioned by HEA since 1980 in six-yearly intervals. The most recent survey of this type was conducted in 2004. The previous survey of all new entrants to higher education took place in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_8709">The studies produced a national participation rate and participation rates by county. Participation rates by region were not produced.  Table 1 below shows the 1998 and 2004 admission rates, and the changes between the two  years. This refers to new entrants attending higher education institutions in the Republic of Ireland. Table 2 shows the 2004 county admission rates when adjusted to take into account of attendance at Northern Irish higher education institutions. Table 3  shows the comparable 1998 rates. Counties most affected by adjusting for intake into Northern Irish institutions are Donegal and Monaghan.</p>

            <p eId="para_9100">There are a range of measures in place to safeguard personal data held by various business units in my Department. My Department has produced a set of guidelines for all staff which sets out the issues to be considered when collecting, storing and processing personal data. Staff are made aware of their obligations under the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003 at induction courses when they join the Department and at Records Management Training courses. The guidelines prepared by the Department have been approved by the Data Protection Commissioner.  If a person or organisation thinks that a person or organisation has not met their obligations under the Data Protection Acts then they can make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed that a total of 22 complaints in relation to this Department have been made to the Commissioner since that office was established in 1989.    These complaints would not necessarily relate to instances where personal data has been compromised.  Of these, one complaint is currently being processed and all other complaints have been resolved.    Data is currently being compiled in relation to agencies and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_9101">The review of systems and procedures in relation to the protection of personal information is ongoing and therefore I am not in a position to comment on the findings of the review at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_9114">My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools. The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at €18.8m annually. The current cost of such provision is estimated at c.€24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed €120m annually if applied to other practical subjects. While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visit the issue in the light of available resources. However, at the current time, resources for this are not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_9115">As the Deputies will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_9116">Other aspects of the Plan include reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age; strengthening teacher training in this area; reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula; promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9117">Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</p>

            <p eId="para_9122">My Department also allocates funding to schools to enable them, where necessary, to employ escorts on school transport services to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support.</p>
            <p eId="para_9123">Where the provision of a transport service is not possible, my Department may offer a grant to the parents towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_9125">It is not the policy of my Department generally to sanction retrospective funding for projects which were progressed without prior approval.  My Department issued a circular to Primary and Post Primary School Authorities advising that it is inappropriate for school authorities to commit to projects and to apply retrospectively for funding.  Therefore funding is not provided for projects undertaken by schools without prior approval from my Department; extras on authorised projects where schools have extended the scope of works without prior approval; variations on authorised projects with the exception of those variations detailed in the circular; or variations and extras on any project carried out without my Department's approval.  Costs incurred in advancing a project beyond the authorised stage are a matter for the school management authority.</p>

The three projects are the 5 Pilot PPP Schools, the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music.  In all three contracts the provision of catering and vending services by the PPP operator is permitted.  All three contracts stipulate that , if catering and/or vending is provided, the PPP Operator must pay a guaranteed income to the authority regardless of the level of net income received from these services.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9135">My Department has made enquiries of the Teaching Council in relation to the Deputy's question and the following information has been received: Over 45,000 teachers who were already teaching in schools on the establishment day of the Teaching Council (28 March 2006), following verification of their details, were automatically deemed registered at that date and have since renewed their registration.  These teachers were registered under section 31(2) of the Teaching Council Act. A number of these are unqualified and while they can be registered their certificate will indicate that they are not qualified teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9136">There are also in the region of 10,000 teachers who were deemed registered on establishment day, under section 31(2), but who have not renewed their registration.  These teachers will now need to register under section 31.  As with new applications, this will involve the submission of transcripts and proof of identity etc.  It is anticipated that a number of these persons will be refused registration as they may not have the qualifications to be registered.   For new applicants, there are two paths to registration with the Teaching Council: 1. Via qualifications recognition (applicants presenting qualifications that have not been previously recognised by the Council)  2. Via direct registration (applicants presenting previously recognised qualifications —  usually graduates of Irish Teacher Education Programmes)</p>
            <p eId="para_9137">As part of the qualifications recognition process, transcripts, course outlines, course handbooks etc are assessed and the applicant is either recognised or not or may receive recognition pending the completion of shortfalls as a result of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_9138">It is only when the recognition process is completed that an applicant will seek registration.  As a result, almost all applicants that seek registration via this route are registered (unless there is a problem with Garda Vetting,  Original Transcripts or Proof of Identity etc.), their qualifications having already been recognised as acceptable for registration as a teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_9139">Since Establishment day, 1,328 applications for the recognition of primary teaching qualifications have been received.  Approximately 80 applications have not been granted recognition.  The remainder have either received full recognition or have been granted provisional recognition on the basis that a number of shortfalls (primarily in the Irish Language) will be fulfilled.  There are also 34 applications from those who have completed a SCITT (School Centred Initial Teacher Training) programme of Teacher Education that are in the process of recognition.</p>
            <p eId="para_9140">At post-primary level, 1,046 applications for recognition have been received, but it is not possible to determine the exact number that have been recognised, as some applicants have received recognition of their degree or teacher training or both, and some are already recognised and were seeking additional subjects.  Of the 1,046, applications, at least 50 applications are from applicants seeking recognition of their degree prior to entering the Postgraduate Diploma in Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_9141">A total of 159 applications for recognition in the Further Education sector have been received within the past 12 months.  The Council has commenced the recognition process and will issue its first batch of decisions in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_9142">Since the Council was established in March 2006 to December 20th 2007, the Teaching Council has registered approximately 3,400 teachers via the Direct Registration Route.  The vast majority of these applicants have graduated from Teacher Education Programmes in Ireland or were recognised as teachers prior to the establishment of the Teaching Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_9143">Three applicants (for post-primary registration) have been refused registration as their undergraduate degree does not satisfy the subject specific requirements of the Council (no teaching subject in the degree).  One applicant (seeking to register as a primary teacher via the postgraduate route) did not satisfy the Department's requirement of a level 8 degree and consequently cannot be registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_9144">There are approximately 150 cases seeking registration where the Council received an application for registration with items missing from the application. The Council has corresponded with each applicant identifying the missing items. However there have been no responses from these applicants.  The Council will further process these applications upon receipt of the outstanding information required.</p>

            <p eId="para_9193">The National Council for Special Education was required by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 to make a report on the implementation of the Act.  This report is essentially advice to the Minister on the steps the Council considers should be taken to implement the Act.  The report sets out an action plan, where the Council envisages implementation of the provisions of the Act over a four year period.  The Council report acknowledges that further work, analysis and discussion, especially with the key stakeholders involved, needed to take place given the extensive and fundamental developments required to implement the Act.  The report further acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for the Council to be prescriptive nor definitive in many areas, and it has put forward its views and recommendations in order to stimulate the necessary discussions and debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_9194">I have previously indicated that I accept the core thrust of the principles and recommendations set out by the Council in its Implementation Report, and I am anxious to implement the Act in full in the quickest time possible.  However, having considered the scale of the issues raised in the Council's implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, I consider that a five year timeframe is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act. As the Deputy will be aware, the legislature, in passing the Act, clearly recognised that implementation would require a considerable change agenda and, for this reason, the Act specifically allows for a five year implementation period.</p>
            <p eId="para_9195">A working group in my Department is finalising its examination of the Councils Implementation Report and the issues raised in discussions with the Education Partners are also being considered in this context. It is envisaged that proposals for the implementation of the Act will be completed shortly with a view to the full implementation of the Act by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_9196">My Department is anxious to work closely with the staff of the Council in regard to the examination of the Report and to advance the implementation process.  The staff of the Council has been kept informed of the status of the examination and of the issues associated with the implementation of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_9197">It must also be acknowledged that, during this necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs. I am committed to continuing this expansion of services to ensure that schools have the necessary capacity to support students with special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_9204">The assessment of means under my Department's third level student support schemes is based on gross income from all sources of the candidate and his/her parents/guardians, where applicable, with certain social welfare and health service executive payments being exempt.</p>
            <p eId="para_9205">Clause 13 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme deals with the declaration of income and other information.  The clause includes the following: "A declaration of reckonable income shall be made by the candidate and the candidate's parents or guardians or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, by the candidate and the candidate's spouse, if applicable, and they shall submit to the Local Authority such information and documentation as may be required by it to process the application in full.  It will be the responsibility of candidates to ensure that the statement of income and other details sought is full and complete in every respect. If a candidate's failure to provide this full and complete information be the result of a deliberate material omission or inaccuracy, the candidate(s) shall be liable to prosecution, loss of grant and repayment, with interest, of any portion of a grant already received."</p>
            <p eId="para_9206">It is necessary, therefore, that information regarding all income, including that from after school/weekend employment, is accounted for when completing the grant application form. However, in the assessment of means, allowance is made for "holiday earnings" on the part of the candidate. Under the terms of the Scheme's holiday earnings are considered as a candidate's reasonable earnings from employment outside of term time. At present holiday earnings of up to €3,810 are excluded in the calculation of reckonable income for grant purposes.  This threshold is currently under review, together with the overall income eligibility thresholds and rates of grant, as part of the annual review of student grants schemes undertaken by my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9210">In accordance with the requirements of Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 my Department reported to the monitoring committee in the Department of Finance in 2007 on its compliance with the 3% requirement.  This report formed part of the data supplied to the National Disability Authority (NDA).  The NDA has presented its 2006 Report On Compliance with Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005 on Employment of People with Disabilities in the Public Service to the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability and Mental Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_9211">In common with all Government departments my Department derived the statistical information which formed the basis of its report to the monitoring committee from the result of the "Count Me in Survey" devised by the National Disability Authority (NDA).  Twenty seven per cent (27%) of the staff of my Department responded to the survey. Of the 27% of staff who responded 7.34% disclosed a disability. If the number of returns disclosing a disability is set against the total number of employees of the Department, this 7.34% reduces to 1.97%.  The "Count Me in Survey" was circulated to all staff of the Department. This was done on two occasions in an attempt to maximise the number of completed survey forms returned.</p>
            <p eId="para_9212">Concerns regarding the reliability of the statistical information produced using the methodology employed in 2006 have been expressed by a number of sources including the NDA itself in its report the Minister of State, where it points out that the data as compiled and presented must be treated with caution. I understand that the NDA is in process of developing an alternative data collection process for 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_9213">In previous years — prior to using the "Count Me In" survey which limited inclusion in statistics to employees who self disclose a disability — a number of employees in addition to those who self-disclosed in response to the "Count Me In" survey were included in statistical returns on the basis that they were initially recruited through competition confined to people with disability and/or because workplace adjustments had been made for them. If account is taken of these employees who did not complete the "Count Me In" survey the percentage of people with a disability employed by my Department rises to 3.44% of the total number of employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_9214">The Public Appointments Service (PAS) recruits most of the staff for my Department. My Department conducts a very limited level of recruitment and this is confined to certain posts such as service posts and temporary and contract posts.  Both the PAS and my Department conduct recruitment in line with codes of practice set out my the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA), these codes include a code specifically on the external and internal appointment of persons with disabilities to positions in the civil service and certain public bodies. In 2006 the PAS held an open recruitment competition at Executive Officer level for people with disabilities. I would anticipate that my Department will be in a position to offer posts to some of those candidates who were successful in this competition as soon as there is a panel in place.</p>

        <b>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of civil and other public servants based in Dublin in her Department and agencies who have applied for decentralisation, who have been transferred to their decentralised post and are currently in position in the decentralised location outside Dublin; the number of civil and other public servants required for decentralisation under plans; the original and expected date for full decentralisation to be in place; the locations together with details of properties and land owned, purchased or planning permissions sought for the construction of premises for decentralisation; the costs incurred to date; the original budgeted for and expected total costs to be incurred for decentralisation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1358">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9217">One hundred and eighty one Dublin based civil servants in my Department have applied to decentralise.  A further 49 Dublin based civil servants from my Department have transferred to decentralised positions outside of Dublin.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme, 400 posts are scheduled to move from the Dublin offices of my Department to Athlone and Mullingar.</p>
            <p eId="para_9218">The report of 19 November 2004 from the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) to the Minister for Finance gave indicative dates for decentralisation to Athlone and Mullingar as Q4 2006 and Q2 2008 respectively.  The current position is that the Athlone element of the decentralisation could be complete by the end of Q2 this year.  The Mullingar element will be completed when the new office accommodation for my Department is ready for occupation.  The recent announcement by Office of Public Works (OPW) of a preferred tenderer for a bundle of 3 Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects to include the office accommodation in Mullingar means that this accommodation should be ready for occupation sometime in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_9219">The new building in Athlone is sited on the same campus as my Department's existing offices in Athlone on land that was already in State ownership.  The OPW has procured a site in Mullingar for the development of the new office for my Department.  The OPW is charged with the responsibility for the property aspects of the programme of decentralisation — including the procurement of property for decentralising organisations and the disposal of property in Dublin that will become surplus — so the management of and reporting on this aspect of the programme is a matter for the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_9220">To date, no non-capital costs have been incurred in connection with the decentralisation of my Department.  The State bodies under the aegis of my Department that are scheduled to decentralise are: the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) to Portarlington; the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education Training and Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education Training and Awards Council (FETAC) to Edenderry; the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to Athlone.  The full decentralisation of these bodies will involve the relocation of 145 posts from Dublin.  Forty three employees of these bodies have either indicated an interest in decentralisation or are recent recruits who are committed relocate as part of a contract of employment.  A further 3 Dublin based employees have transferred out of these bodies to decentralised positions outside of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_9221">On the basis of progress to date towards the provision of permanent accommodation in Portarlington, the NCCA and NEWB may be able to occupy their new permanent accommodation by the end of 2009. Both of these bodies anticipate moving some employees into temporary accommodation outside of Dublin in advance of this.  The position is less clear in relation to the NQAI, HETAC, FETAC and the HEA.  None of these bodies were identified as potential early movers in the DIG report of 19 November 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_9226">The Department has not been involved in the design of the school nor has capital funding been provided in respect of the project.  However following a recent communication from the private construction firm I understand that the proposal to construct a new school is changed to an offer of a site.</p>
            <p eId="para_9227">In order to progress the application an assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area will be required in order to determine the long term projected staffing figure on which the school's accommodation needs will be based.

            <p eId="para_9232">I am aware that many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, including Maynooth, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.

As a matter of course meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision so as to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of the required education infrastructure.

            <p eId="para_9233">In Maynooth, the Department has already made significant interventions including the provision at primary level of a new 16 classroom school for Scoil Uí Fhiaich, an extension to the Presentation Convent primary school to bring capacity to 24 classrooms and the planned extension to Maynooth Boys primary school to also bring this up to a 24 classroom facility.</p>

Site identification and acquisition procedures are on-going for a permanent home for the school. It is intended that the site will also facilitate the development of a post primary school.

As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria.

            <p eId="para_9260">The records maintained by my Department are confined to the transfers of civil servants in and out of my Department.  These records show that to date 49 civil servants who were previously assigned to Dublin posts have relocated to posts outside of Dublin under the programme of decentralisation.  A further 3 people who were employed in Dublin in a State body under the aegis of my Department have relocated to posts outside of Dublin.  These records also show that 78 civil servants who were previously assigned to offices in my Department in locations outside of Dublin have relocated to other locations under the programme of decentralisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9261">Estimating the numbers to relocate this year is difficult as the programme is voluntary and actual relocation depends on decisions made by individuals close to the time of any proposed relocation as well as the rate of progress a large number of external organisations towards their decentralisations.  I can tell the Deputy that my Department expects to relocate approximately 50 to 60 Dublin based civil servants, along with approximately 15 to 20 civil servants who are based outside of Dublin during the course of the relocation of posts from Dublin to the midlands from Dublin this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9263">Details of the records held by my Department on the numbers of civil servants who have relocated under the programme of decentralisation are provided on the table attached.</p>
            <p eId="para_9264">At present my Department has two main locations outside of Dublin in Athlone and Tullamore. In addition to this it has smaller regional offices outside of Dublin in Navan, Naas, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Galway and Mullingar along with a number of offices throughout the State accommodating Inspectors and psychologists working locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_9265">The agencies in the Education sector scheduled to decentralise are the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Education Welfare Boards, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education Training and Awards Council, the Further Education Training and Awards Council and the Higher Education Authority. The rate of progress towards decentralisation by these agencies varies, ranging from recruitment policies that support the programme to plans for an advance movement of posts this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9266">All aspects of property procurement and disposal in connection with the programme of decentralisation is a matter for the Office of Public Works.  No non-capital costs have been incurred by my Department to date under the programme of decentralisation.  The agencies in the Education sector have reported just in excess of €13,000 in non-capital expenditure to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_9267">No member of the staff of my Department is assigned to manage the implementation of the programme of decentralisation on an exclusive basis.  The tasks involved are undertaken by staff members assigned to the Human Resources and Corporate Services areas as part of their work.</p>

            <p eId="para_9417">In order to comply with the reporting responsibilities under the Disability Act, 2005, the Department carried out a survey in 2007 in relation to the disability status of staff.  The percentage of all staff who declared that they had a disability, as defined under the Disability Act, 2005, at that time was 2.3%.</p>
            <p eId="para_9418">In the period since the survey was carried out, a number of staff who had declared a disability have retired and a number of additional staff have provided declarations.  Adjusting the survey result for these changes, the percentage of staff with disabilities now stands at 2.7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_9419">Taking account of factors such as the response rate to the survey and cases where staff declared a disability but did not wish to be counted, the Department is satisfied that is has met the 3% employment quota set under the Disability Act, 2005.  A further survey of staff is planned to be carried out shortly and this will provide staff with a disability, who may not have disclosed the matter previously, another opportunity to declare their position.</p>
            <p eId="para_9420">All the staff referred to above were employed by the Department prior to 2002.  During 2006 the Department participated in the Willing and Able Mentoring pilot programme on the employment of people with disabilities, sponsored by AHEAD.  Participants in the programme were drawn from both the public and private sector.  Under the programme the Department employed one person on a six-month contract that expired early in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_9424">I propose to take Questions Nos 1116 to 1118, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9425">The Government Decision on decentralisation, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 3 December 2003, provides for the transfer of my entire Department's Dublin based civil service staff to Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  The number of posts to be relocated to Newbridge is about 200.  A total of 338 personnel have made applications under the Cental Applications Facility (CAF) to decentralise to Newbridge, the vast majority of whom are Dublin based applicants.  Currently, 143 Newbridge bound staff are in their decentralising posts which reflects about 80% of the total administrative and clerical staff requirement.  All of these staff were Dublin based prior to any decentralisation-related moves and about one third were already serving in my Department in December 2003.  No staff have transferred to Newbridge yet, as the construction of the Department's new headquarters is not expected to be completed until 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_9426">In addition to the civil servants, 43 military personnel will be located in Newbridge.  A further 335 military personnel together with 78 support staff will decentralise to the new Defence Forces Headquarters building in the Curragh Camp.</p>
            <p eId="para_9427">The Civil Defence Board, which is a State Authority under the aegis of the Department of Defence, transferred to its new purpose built Headquarters in Roscrea in May 2006 with a staff of 17.  To date, a total of 21 staff have transferred from Dublin posts in my Department to the Civil Defence Board in Roscrea and a further 9 staff members transferred from other provincial locations.  8 staff members have transferred under the CAF to my Department's offices in Renmore, Co Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_9428">My Department's Decentralisation Unit manages the decentralisation programme for the Department and currently has three members of staff.  The sale of a site in Newbridge as approved by Kildare County Council will shortly be finalised.  The planning process has also been completed.  The OPW has selected a preferred tenderer who will carry out the construction of the Department's headquarters.</p>

            <p eId="para_9434">Subject to the requirement to consider each case on its merits, the general position is that a child reaching 18 in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy would, unless there are issues surrounding his or her conduct, be permitted to remain in the State either as a dependant of their parent or in their own right.  They would receive an immigration stamp reflecting their status as a student (Stamp 2 or 2A) or otherwise as a dependant (Stamp 3).  This presupposes that their parents are legally in the State and that the children themselves have registered with the Immigration authorities when required.  Currently all non-EEA nationals over the age of 16 are required to be registered.  If the person wishes to take up full-time employment they should apply to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

            <p eId="para_9436">The right to operate a business is something that depends on the immigration status of the foreign national.  EEA nationals and those who have a Stamp 4 permission are entitled to operate a business.  Those here on more restricted permissions do not enjoy this right.  For a person who is coming to the State specifically for this purpose there is a scheme in operation whereby they are required to satisfy certain criteria including investment of some €300K in their business.  The original rationale for this scheme was to encourage employment creation.  My Department will be conducting a review of the Business Permission scheme in the near future. The Deputy's point of interest will be taken into consideration at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_9440">It is understood that the Deputy is referring to aerodromes licensed by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA).  I am informed by the Department of Transport that there are 15 aerodromes licensed by the IAA for private use in the State.  In addition, there are 14 other aerodromes licensed by the IAA for public use including Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_9441">Section 6 of Immigration Act, 2004 states that a non-national coming by sea or air from outside the State shall not, without the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, land elsewhere than at an approved port.  A non-national who lands in the State in contravention of these provisions is deemed to be a non-national who has been refused a permission to land in the State, and is guilty of an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_9442">The Immigration Act 2004 (Approved Ports) Regulations, 2004 came into operation on 13 February 2004.  The ports specified in the Schedule to these Regulations are prescribed for the purposes of section 6(2), Immigration Act, 2004 and, therefore, are approved for entry into the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_9443">Members of An Garda Síochána who have been appointed as Immigration Officers in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act, 2004, fulfil immigration control duties at ports which have been approved for the landing of non-nationals.  Airports which are not approved for entry into the State for the purposes of the Act are monitored by members of An Garda Síochána in the relevant Garda Districts concerned.  The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) provides backup and expertise to local Garda District personnel in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_9444">Provisions under the Air Navigation &amp; Transports Acts, relating to the power of entry by members of An Garda Síochána to aerodromes, may be utilised for the purpose of undertaking such monitoring.  If non-nationals are found to have landed in the State in breach of the provisions of section 6 of the Immigration Act, 2004, the circumstances of such incidents are subject to thorough investigation.  Monitoring by Customs and Excise is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners for whom the Minister for Finance has responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_9454">Members on mountain bike patrol perform duties as directed by their supervisors which includes active patrolling of public order hot-spots, and the detection of crime and other offences, including the prevention of anti-social activity.  Members on these duties may also be deployed at venues or sporting events which attract large numbers of people.  Given the high visibility and unrestricted access to areas where patrol vehicles cannot access, mountain bike patrols have proven to be an effective method of patrolling. They are also ideal for patrolling park land and open areas.</p>

In respect of the criminal offence of manslaughter and related motoring offences the Commission has recommended that the existing road traffic offence of dangerous driving causing death should continue to exist alongside the more serious offence of manslaughter.  It would therefore be the case that where there is a very high degree of culpability, a driver responsible for a road death could be prosecuted for manslaughter.</p>

            <p eId="para_9536">Since the publication of the Report a key development in terms of visa applications has been the transfer of this function to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the management of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.

I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the coverage by the Force of the Ongar area of west Dublin forms part of these deliberations.</p>

            <p eId="para_9564">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently made provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.

            <p eId="para_9566">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of Cashel Garda station as at 31 December 2007, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 12. Cashel forms part of the Cahir District and on the same date the personnel strength of Cahir District was 57.  The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_9567">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Garda station referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_9568">Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs (including the support structures underpinning this activity), conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national as well as international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_9569">National units, such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation all have specific roles in reducing drug supply and seizing the ill-gotten gains of drug traffickers. All of these units operate under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9570">These strategies continue to result in operational successes as evidenced by the ongoing levels of drugs seized by the Gardaí. The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international levels is constantly monitored by the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_9571">The enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities which is reflected in An Garda Síochána's Policing Plan for 2008.</p>

Ireland had significant discretion as to the implementation of some aspects of the above Directives. This discretion extended, for example, to:

providing for genuine and determining occupational requirements, including religious ethos
providing for positive action
definition of harassment according to the laws and practices of Ireland
inclusion of the armed forces in the scope of application
providing for differences in treatment on the grounds of age
maintaining and introducing more favourable provisions for the protection of the principle of equal treatment than those set out in the Directives
opt for an additional 3 years to implement provisions relating to age and disability.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9761">The legislative basis for the taking of fingerprints in respect of foreign nationals who enter the State is provided for as far back as the Aliens Order of 1946.  This Order imposed, subject to a small number of exceptions, a registration requirement on foreign nationals which included a requirement to provide fingerprints when so required by a registration officer. The limited number of exceptions to the registration requirement includes those aged under 16 years and those whose visit was for a period of not more than three months.  Since that time the registration process, including the fingerprint requirement, has been preserved, in respect of non-EEA nationals, in subsequent legislation, most recently in the Immigration Act 2004.  However, the requirement to provide fingerprints under this provision has rarely, if ever, been used.  Fingerprints are not taken on a routine basis during registration.</p>
            <p eId="para_9762">For asylum processing and identification purposes, section 9A of the Refugee Act 1996, as inserted by the Immigration Act 2003, provides powers for authorised officers and immigration officers to take the fingerprints of an asylum applicant.  In practice, fingerprints are taken from all applicants for asylum.  Where an asylum applicant refuses to provide fingerprints he or she will be deemed not to have made reasonable efforts to establish his or her true identity and will be deemed to have failed in his or her duty to cooperate.  In addition, Ireland is a participant in the Eurodac system. This system, established under Council Regulation 2725/2000, requires Member States to take the full fingerprints of every applicant for asylum over 14 years of age.  This is done in order to facilitate the application of the Dublin II Regulations, which makes it possible to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.</p>
            <p eId="para_9763">The use of biometric information (including fingerprints) for immigration purposes has been the subject of ongoing review having regard to available technology, efforts to combat identity fraud and our international obligations.  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department published its ‘Outline policy proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill — A Discussion Document' in April 2005.  A common thread throughout that document was the need to make greater use of technology, in particular, biometric identifiers, for the purposes of enhancing security in relation to border control processes.  It also highlighted the role of biometric identifiers in ensuring the security and integrity of documentation such as visas and residence permits and also for registration purposes.  In addition, the Discussion Document pointed to the need to introduce registration for those under 16 years of age so as to deal more effectively with the increasing movement of minors and to provide further protections against the crime of human trafficking.  In providing for the registration of children the necessity to take their fingerprints may be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_9764">The proposals in this Document are reflected in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which was published yesterday.  The Bill incorporates the taking of biometric information into many of the immigration processes set out in the Bill including border controls, registration, issuance of permits etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_9765">As the Deputy will be aware, the commissioning of the first phase of the new national Automatic Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) began on 22 October 2007. When it is fully rolled out, this system will give the Garda National Immigration Bureau the capacity and equipment necessary to electronically capture and store the fingerprints of all non-EEA nationals upon registration. The new system will complement the existing electronic registration card system which has been designed with this in mind.  It will also provide the Garda National Immigration Bureau with facilities to capture prints at air and sea ports and mobile fingerprinting capture and search capability. The AFIS system will also be integrated with the Garda Information Systems and will provide full interoperability between PULSE, the National Immigration Bureau and the Garda Technical Bureau which will lead to further efficiencies in the processing of fingerprint data by linking it to the other electronic records in An Garda Síochána.  These developments will be completed during 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_9766">Fingerprints are stored on the AFIS database which is housed in a secure location in a Garda facility.  Access to the AFIS database itself is controlled by use of passwords and access controls and a full audit trail is kept of all transactions associated with the AFIS system.  All passwords are managed and controlled and comply with international and industrial standards.</p>

The Regulations were amended in December 2006 by the European Communities (Free Movement  of Persons)(No. 2) Regulations S.I. 656 of 2006  to take into account the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_9813">Proposals to alter the boundaries of a Garda regional or divisional geographical area, or to establish or relocate a divisional or district headquarters are matters in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan.  The 2008 Policing Plan sets out the Commissioner's plans to realign the boundaries of a number of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  I recently approved the plan before laying it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Included in the plan is the creation of a new Kildare Garda Division with Naas as its headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_9814">The key benefits of this initiative for County Kildare and more widely are:</p>
            <p eId="para_9815">greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and working of Joint Policing Committees;</p>
            <p eId="para_9816">reduced duplication of effort for Garda management where Garda Divisions and Districts currently cross Local Authority boundaries; and</p>
            <p eId="para_9817">better consultation between An Garda Síochána and elected representatives concerning matters of public disorder and other anti-social behaviour and crime in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_9818">A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda Síochána to implement the establishment of the Kildare Division and the other changes contained in the policing plan.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the re-alignment of the regional and divisional boundaries set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_9823">Every visa application is considered on its own merits and an application for a visa to pursue a course in Ireland which involves an internship is not regarded as exceptional.  Detailed information regarding the process and requirements for a study visa is available for all potential applicants on the Website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service — www.inis.gov.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_9824">Certain criteria for study visas occasionally need to be reviewed, for example, the estimated cost of living for an academic year.  However, the fundamental process and requirements have not been changed in the past three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_9825">Applications for study visas involving internships are not considered separately and, hence, there are no figures available.  I can inform the Deputy, however, that the number of study visa applications received in Dublin during 2007 was 3,712 and the total number approved was 1,098.</p>

            <p eId="para_9960">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1177, 1220, 1221 and 1264 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9961">In accordance with section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations are a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that their accommodation requirements for policing the Tallaght area will be best met by the re-development of the existing Garda Station site at the Square.</p>
            <p eId="para_9962">The Commissioners of Public Works, who have responsibility for the provision, refurbishment and maintenance of Garda buildings, are appraising the existing site with a view to maximising its development potential for the State.  Planning is at an advanced stage for a development of the site to address all Garda requirements for Tallaght, which will include a significant increase in the current accommodation available to the Gardaí as well as facilitating the re-location of the Divisional Headquarters.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no avoidable delay in addressing Garda accommodation needs in Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_9963">The Deputy will be aware that it is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as at 31 December 2007, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the total strength of Tallaght Garda Station was 181.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Tallaght will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of Garda needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9964">I am aware of the policing challenges facing An Garda Síochána in the Tallaght area, many of which I have determined as overall priorities for An Garda Síochána in the 2008 Policing Plan and which the Commissioner has elaborated on as strategic goals for 2008 in the context of the Plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_9981">Long term residency was introduced by way of an administrative scheme in May 2004. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_9982">Long term residency is granted on the basis that a non EEA national had completed five years (60 months) legal residence in the State which is reflected in the corresponding stamp 1 or stamp 4 endorsements in a person's passport and not by the dates of commencement and expiry of each work permit.</p>
            <p eId="para_9983">At time of processing, each application is examined  to verify the applicant meets the residency criteria.

            <p eId="para_10013">The Expert Group on Children Detention Schools was tasked by the Minister for Children in 2006 to initiate and plan for the necessary redevelopment of existing children detention schools and for the development of new facilities to extend the children detention school model to all children who have been ordered to be detained by the Court, and to advise accordingly.  Having examined a number of options for such a redevelopment of the children detention schools the Expert Group submitted its final report to my colleague, Mr. Brendan Smith T.D., Minister for Children, in December 2007.  I understand that Minister Smith is considering the Expert Group report and intends to bring recommendations to Government in the near future.  In light of this, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the report at this time except to say that the Report will be published at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_10014">The redevelopment of children detention school places will take time as it requires detailed planning, design and consultation with stakeholders to ensure that high quality facilities are created.  In the interim it is necessary to retain the use of St. Patrick's Institution until suitable children detention school places can be created with regard to 16 and 17 year old boys.</p>
            <p eId="para_10015">As all prison accommodation on the Mountjoy site, including St. Patrick's Institution, is to be closed it is necessary to make provision for interim accommodation, should it be required, for 16 and 17 year old boys on the Thornton Hall campus.  The campus structure of Thornton Hall will ensure that a facility for 16 and 17 year old boys is completely segregated from facilities being used by adult offenders.  While it is prudent to ensure detention services are available to the Courts the redevelopment of children detention school places will not be affected by this interim measure.  On completion of the detention school development project all children under 18 years of age being detained will only be accommodated in dedicated children facilities.  This is compatible with Article 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and as provided for in the Children Act 2001, as amended.</p>

Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.

            <p eId="para_10160">Proposals to alter the boundaries of a Garda regional or divisional geographical area, or to establish or relocate a divisional or district headquarters are matters in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan.  I recently approved the 2008 Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner's proposals to realign the boundaries of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  Included in this is the realignment of the boundary of the Cork North Garda Division.  The planned changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_10161">A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda Síochána to implement these planned changes for the Cork North and other Garda Divisions.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the regional and divisional boundary realignments set out in the plan and will set out a timetable for the establishment of the new divisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_10163">The case referred to by the Deputy was one where the person convicted was an EU national and as such entitled to reside in another Member State, in this case Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_10164">The obligations on Member States to permit the free movement of European citizens are set out in Directive 2004/38/EC  which is transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. Provision is made in the Directive for the exchange of information from police records with the Member State of origin or any other Member State as required.  Such an exchange of information is permitted ‘In order to ascertain whether the person concerned represents a danger for public policy or public security. . .'  However, ‘Such enquiries shall not be made as a matter of routine' and the Member State consulted shall have up to two months to reply to such a request.</p>
            <p eId="para_10165">The Directive also provides (in Article 27) that ‘ Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens', however, these measures ‘shall comply with the principle of proportionality and shall be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the individual concerned.  Previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures'.  The scope for a Member State to refuse entry to its territory is further restricted to the extent that the ‘personal conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat...' and that ‘Justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted'.</p>
            <p eId="para_10166">In relation to the exchange of information on criminal records between Member States more generally the Deputy might be interested to note that at its meeting on 12-13 June, 2007 the Council of the European Union reached an agreement on a general approach on a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States. Discussions are ongoing with a view to the formal adoption of the Framework Decision as soon as possible. This agreement follows the adoption in 2005 by the Council of a Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, which supplements the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_10167">In addition, the Garda Síochána may forward a request for the record of the criminal convictions of a person to the country concerned through the Interpol channel. The requisite information may then be received through that channel.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_10169">The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX) was established in 2005 following the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004.  The FRONTEX Regulation is a measure under Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community concerning visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons. The Agency is tasked with improving the coordination of operational cooperation between the Member States in the field of external border management and liaises closely with other Community Agencies responsible for the security of the external borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_10170">Ireland is not bound by, or subject to, the application of the Regulation establishing FRONTEX as the Regulation was brought forward as an instrument constituting a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part.    Ireland and the United Kingdom may nevertheless take part in FRONTEX activities with the agreement of the Management Board.  In 2007 arrangements were made which allow for participation by Ireland in the Agency on the basis of an agreed annual request and financial contribution.  Ireland requested participation in 2007 and made a financial contribution of  €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_10171">The question of whether the role of the Agency should be broadened to include drug smuggling is a matter that can only be decided by the Council of the European Union. Any proposal to broaden the remit of the Agency would require an assessment of the added value to be gained and an examination of the legal basis upon which the Agency is founded.</p>
            <p eId="para_10172">There is already considerable ongoing work taking place internationally to prevent drug smuggling into Ireland.  The Garda National Drugs Unit continually strives to increase the level of cooperation through international law enforcement agencies, Interpol and Europol and Garda liaison officers are currently in place in the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and at Europol and Interpol.  These officers liaise with the police and judicial authorities in those and neighbouring jurisdictions in the context of serious and organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, which has an Irish dimension.  Ongoing cooperation through these arrangements continue to result in a number of significant drug seizures and arrests and has been successful in dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks who seek to supply and distribute drugs within the State.  In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau continues its statutory remit to deprive criminals of their assets pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 to 2005 and relevant Revenue and Social Welfare legislation irrespective of where the people in question may be located.</p>
            <p eId="para_10173">The recent establishment of the Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre in Lisbon will further enhance efforts in detecting drug dealing into Europe.  Ireland is one of the founding members of this centre.  This Centre which is international and inter-agency, is focusing on intelligence exchange leading to the interdiction of large maritime and aviation drug shipments, and the severing of links between transportation networks and the shore based command and control personnel.  Ireland will place a Garda Drugs Liaison Officer and a Customs Liaison Officer at the Centre on a full time basis.  The Naval Service will place an officer at the Centre as the need arises when it is involved in operational activity there.</p>
            <p eId="para_10174">Finally, I will continue to keep the measures and resources for tackling organised crime, including drug trafficking, under review.  I will also continue to work with my EU colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council to ensure that every possible measure, legislative or otherwise, is put in place to enhance EU strategies for combating transnational organised crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_10177">An application for Subsidiary Protection arises where a non — national, who has been refused refugee status, is served with a notice of intention to deport under section 3 (3) (a) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended.

            <p eId="para_10180">The Criminal Assets Bureau has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime, including drug trafficking, in this jurisdiction since its inception in 1996. The significant successes that the Bureau continues to achieve by its operations demonstrates the effectiveness of its approach in pursuing illegally gotten gains.  The manner in which the Bureau operates has, in the period of its existence, come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons seeking to derive profits from criminal activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_10181">In relation to the issue of the Bureau's work at local levels, I can inform the Deputy that in order to maximise the benefit that can be derived from local knowledge, officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau work closely with Gardaí from specific regions and localities in order to ensure that the efforts of the Bureau are targeted in the most effective manner possible.  I have also already included in the Government's policing priorities for 2008 for An Garda Síochána a specific reference to enhanced liaison arrangements between Garda Divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_10182">The Bureau continues to utilise the services of Divisional Criminal Assets Profilers throughout the country.  At present twenty seven divisional profilers have been appointed and are operational and the complement of Divisional profilers will continue to be monitored and reviewed on an on-going basis.  The use of local Garda officers in this way ensures that preparatory groundwork can be carried out in advance of a full investigation by the Bureau. Asset profilers have at all times recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.  Essentially a key function of these profilers is to ascertain and build up information at local levels and point out individuals at whom the Bureau's work can be targeted. Such information is then investigated and followed up further by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_10183">Finally, I can assure the Deputy that any individuals in local communities who believe they can openly flaunt wealth or assets secured through illegal activities, including drug dealing, will be vigorously pursued by the Gardaí either through the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 or through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau under its statutory remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_10229">The person concerned arrived in the State on 17 August 2003 and applied for asylum the following day. The person concerned did not attend for interview at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner as she was directed to do and, as a consequence, her application was deemed to be 'withdrawn'.  She was notified by letter dated 15 June 2004 that the Refugee Applications Commissioner was recommending to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that she should not be declared a refugee. In addition, she was notified that there was no appeal against this recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_10230">Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 5 July 2004, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. No response was received to this letter at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_10231">On 8 September 2006, the person concerned, through her legal representative, sought to be re-admitted to the asylum process, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 (7) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended). This request was duly considered and, by letter dated 9 October 2006, the person concerned was informed (through her legal representative) that her application for re-admittance to the asylum process had been refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_10232">The file of the person concerned now falls to be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended). When this consideration has been completed, the file will be passed to me for decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_10233">The principal reasons for the delay in having the case of the person concerned processed to completion would appear to be her non-engagement in the asylum process while her case was before the Refugee Applications Commissioner and her having been outside the State for a number of years since the lodgement of her initial application for asylum.</p>

Inspections are carried out of all licensed premises in the area to ensure that the provisions of the liquor licensing and other relevant legislation are being complied with. These measures have resulted in an increase in the number of incidents detected and persons arrested.</p>
            <p eId="para_10313">A Policing Forum, consisting of relevant stakeholders, including the Inspector in Charge at Clontarf Garda station, local residents' groups and the management of local licensed premises, has been established and discusses, inter alia, issues regarding licensing and the concerns of residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_10314">Current policing plans in the area are predicated on the prevention of anti-social behaviour and public disorder, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents. Garda Units are directed to pay particular attention to areas where anti-social behaviour is likely to occur. This strategy will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the fact that Waterford City Council officials have informed members of the JPC that it cannot hold public meetings until additional guidelines are produced by his Department in view of the fact that Letterkenny JPC have conducted two public meetings, the existing guidelines published on 23 May 2007 governing both Waterford JPC and Letterkenny JPC make provisions for the conduct of public meetings and his response to a parliamentary question on 7 November 2007 that it is the responsibility of each JPC to fulfil the provisions of those guidelines.

            <p eId="para_10374">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1281 and 1282 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_10375">The Joint Policing Committees currently established in a pilot phase operate under revised guidelines issued by my predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in May 2007, following consultations with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. These guidelines revised the original guidelines issued in June 2006 so as to enable the establishment of a number of additional Committees to take place. There are currently 29 Committees in operation. The purpose of the pilot phase is to gain experience from the operation of a number of Committees in a variety of local authority areas before rolling them out to all local authority areas in the State. In general the outcome to date has been positive, and the Committees are meeting definite local needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_10376">The experience gained from the operation of the Committees is currently being evaluated. As a first step in this evaluation my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I held a consultation seminar on 29 November, 2007 with participants in the pilot Committees to consider the lessons from their operation to date in preparation for the roll out. The seminar was a very useful exercise and following on from it work has commenced on revising the guidelines in the light of the experience gained to date. Following consultation with my Ministerial colleagues I intend to issue guidelines to enable the roll out of the Committees to take place as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_10377">Section 10 of the current guidelines provides for the arranging and hosting of public meetings by Joint Policing Committees. The guidelines are drafted in such a way as to enable Committees to operate as effectively and flexibly as possible so as to meet the various needs of their own areas. As part of this approach the guidelines envisage that Committees would hold public meetings at regular intervals.</p>
            <p eId="para_10378">Section 36 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of local policing fora by a Joint Policing Committee as they are considered necessary. The current guidelines provide that supplemental guidelines for the fora will be made at a later date (paragraph 13.3). It is intended that this will happen in the context of the revision of the Committee guidelines. A steering group, chaired by my Department and with membership from An Garda Síochána, the National Drugs Strategy Team and the community sector, has been established to contribute to the development of the supplemental guidelines, and its work is well advanced.</p>

            <p eId="para_10382">Following proposals made by the Garda Commissioner and taking account of recommendations made by the Garda Síochána Inspectorate in its report on barricade incidents, An Garda Síochána was authorised to add conductive electric devices (CEDs) to the range of less lethal options available to the Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU).  The purpose of less lethal options is to provide an alternative to the use of lethal force when a critical incident requiring such action may arise.  The Garda authorities carried out extensive research and consultation with relevant professional bodies, including other law enforcement agencies and medical professionals, before the introduction of CED's. Their use is limited to members of the ERU who have undergone appropriate training and qualification in their use and deployment is regulated and controlled by detailed guidelines.  I am satisfied with the approach adopted by the Garda authorities in this regard.</p>

The Deputy will also be aware that I recently approved the 2008 Annual Policing Plan and laid it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It sets out the Commissioner's proposals to realign the boundaries of a number of Garda Divisions around the country to make them coterminous with local authority boundaries.  A detailed programme of work is currently being developed by An Garda Síochána to implement the changes contained in the policing plan.  This programme of work will also examine the geographical areas of district and sub-district stations arising from the re-alignment of the regional and divisional boundaries set out in the plan. The SAPS for each Garda Division are being developed by An Garda Síochána with the assistance of the CSO.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of each different Garda Division will be fully considered by the Commissioner.</p>

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.

The data received indicates that the percentage of people working in my Department who have a disability is 3.1%, marginally in excess of the 3% employment target.  It must be noted that the National Disability Authority has identified certain limitations which are common to all public service and civil service bodies in relation to the data gathering process and it is my understanding that further proposals are to be made by the NDA in this regard.  It is not possible to say how many people with disabilities have been hired from outside the Civil Service as people are not required to disclose a disability when they are being employed.  However, I can say that my Department does invite new employees to voluntarily disclose if they have a disability in  order to try and facilitate reasonable accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_10457">Under my Department's decentralisation programme, just over nine hundred posts are scheduled to relocate from Dublin to seven different provincial locations by 2010.  I am pleased to report that, to-date, four hundred and twenty officers have taken up duty and the Department now has a presence in all of our seven locations.  Within that number, two hundred and twenty-three officers transferred from Dublin.  Around one hundred and thirty posts are due to relocate in 2008 but because the validation process, which is required under the central agreements, is still under way, it is not possible, at this stage, to provide a breakdown between Dublin and provincial applications.  However, I can say that, by the end of 2008, my Department will have successfully moved 60% of its total complement of decentralising posts, with two years of the programme still to run.  The administration of the decentralisation programme within my Department is carried out by five officers.  All matters relating to the provision of office accommodation, buildings and other property solutions, required under the programme, are primarily the responsibility of the Office of Public Works and I am informed by the OPW that the following table sets out the relevant details.  The non-property costs, such as IT and training, incurred by my own Department, up until the end of the third quarter of 2007, amounted to nearly €1.3m.</p>

In recognition of the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission, a high-level interdepartmental committee has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in this area.  A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and other actions to be taken in response to definitive recommendations for reforms which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments, and to determine a timescale for their implementation.

            <p eId="para_11105">The Government has announced the provision of €270 million for the purchase of carbon allowances over the period 2007-13. This sum is in addition to €20 million provided in my Department's Vote in 2006.  No additional funding was required or provided in Budget 2008.  Following the enactment of the Carbon Fund Act in March 2007, the National Treasury Management Agency is now statutorily designated as purchasing agent for the acquisition of carbon allowances. The Agency is developing a purchasing programme on foot of the potential need indicated in the National Climate Change Strategy to purchase up to 18 million allowances in partial fulfilment of Ireland's obligations pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol. A national policy framework on the purchase of allowances, which is set out in Annex 3 to the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-12, provides guidance for the Agency in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_11106">In 2006, Ireland committed to investing €20m in the Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund offered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and a further €20m in Funds offered by the World Bank, namely the Carbon Fund for Europe and the second tranche of the BioCarbon Fund. No other commitments were made prior to the designation of the National Treasury Management Agency as purchasing agent.  The return on these investments, in terms of the actual amount of credits acquired, will depend on the price of carbon as projects in the Fund mature and credits become available to the Fund participants.  Current indications from the Fund managers point to a price in the range of €7 to €12 per credit.  Total expenditure on these funds to date is €23.7m, €20m in 2006 and the remainder in 2007.  Any further investments and related payments are a matter for the National Treasury Management Agency.</p>

In accordance with the Government decision, the Inter-Departmental Committee set up an Expert Group on Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, which published its report in 2007.  The Expert Group consulted with industry, recognised national and international experts and the wider community in order to complete its report, which is aimed at the Government and the public, rather than the scientific community.  The Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by electric appliances in the home and from electricity pylons.  It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields, and is available for download on the Department's website (www.environ.ie).  Following the publication of the report, responsibility for the health effects of electromagnetic fields was transferred by Government decision to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government where the Report and its recommendations are currently under consideration.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_11110">The European Commission published a package of energy and climate change proposals on 23 January 2008.  The proposals are intended to meet the commitments made by EU Heads of State and Government at the 2007 Spring meeting of the European Council that EU greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by at least 20% on 1990 levels by 2020 and that renewable energy contribute 20% of the EU's energy requirements by 2020.  The package comprises the following proposals: a decision on the effort-sharing proposal for Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020; a directive amending the original EU Emissions Trading Scheme Directive (2003/87/EC) so as to improve and extend the scheme; a directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources; and a directive or Regulation on carbon capture and storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_11111">In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, in the event of the EU target increasing in the context of a new international agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, the proposed level of effort for individual Member States will have to be revisited.  In Ireland's case, the effect of the proposals would be installations in the emissions trading sector would participate in a new Emissions Trading Scheme managed by the Commission rather than by national Governments, with an overall target of a reduction of 21% in emissions by 2020 as compared to 1995: outside of the emissions trading sector, the required reduction in our domestic greenhouse gas emissions would be 20% by 2020 as compared to 2005; and there would be an overall target of 16% of final energy consumption from renewable energy to be met across the electricity, heat and transport sectors by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_11112">In response to the publication of the package, the Government reaffirmed its commitment to meeting the challenge of climate change.  While it is too early in the process to draw any specific conclusions on the package of measures, the proposals raise very serious economic and social issues for Ireland, and require very careful consideration.  The greenhouse gas and renewable energy targets may be challenging but so too is the threat of climate change.  The scientific advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that these are the scale of emission reductions that must be made by developed countries if greenhouse gases are to be stabilised in the atmosphere at a safe level.  The Government has established a Technical Analysis Steering Group to undertake detailed analysis of the proposals and their implications for the purpose of informing the Government's response to the proposals and for subsequent discussions with the Commission and other Member States.</p>

            <p eId="para_11116">Minimum standards for private rented accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993, which specify requirements in relation to matters such as the structural condition of dwellings and their sanitary facilities, heating and ventilation.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Failure to do so is an offence, subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €3,000, or a term of six months in prison or both and €250 for each day of a continuing offence.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority.  In September 2006 a comprehensive Action Programme to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation was announced, involving a range of measures including improved regulation, enforcement, funding and information.  Good progress is being made with this Programme, an important element of which is the updating of the existing standards regulations in consultation with relevant interests.  Submissions received in that regard are being considered and draft revised regulations should be available by the end of March 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_11134">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1307, 1308, 1319, 1326, 1342, 1343, 1351 and 1371 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11135">Budget 2007 announced proposals for new motor tax and vehicle registration tax (VRT) systems to reward low CO2 emitting and penalise high CO2 emitting, cars.  It was made clear at the time that the new system would apply to new cars and pre-owned imported cars.  A public consultation process was held from December 2006 to March 2007 following press notices inviting public submissions.  Both the public consultation process and subsequent press comment pointed to the desirability of members of the public having reasonable notice of any tax changes being introduced and the need for an acceptable lead-in period for the motor trade.  It was against this background that 1 July 2008 was chosen as the starting date for both the new motor tax and VRT   systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_11136">The aim of the new system is to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers in the future.  From 1 July 2008, anyone buying a new or pre-owned imported car will be aware of both the motor tax and vehicle registration tax (VRT) rates which will apply, based on CO2 emissions.  In order to promote awareness of the new CO2-based motor tax and VRT systems, and to influence purchasing decisions of car buyers, a new mandatory labelling system will be introduced which will be accompanied by an active public information campaign.  Existing cars were purchased in the knowledge that the basis of assessment for both motor tax and VRT was engine capacity (c.c.) and not CO2 emissions.  In view of the fact that the CO2 rating for similar size cars (in terms of engine capacity) can vary as much as 45%, it would be inequitable to apply the new CO2 system to the existing fleet.  It would also be unfair to penalise car owners for a purchasing decision made in the past.  In addition, it is essential that there is certainty and accuracy in term of CO2 ratings.  Under both the new motor tax and VRT systems, the CO2 rating will be based on the car's Certificate of Conformity, under EU type approval law.  This CO2 rating will be captured initially by the Revenue Commissioners at vehicle registration tax stage and passed on to the national vehicle file.  In the absence of a certificate and the Revenue Commissioners not being satisfied as to the CO2 rating the motorist will be required to pay the highest motor tax rate.  The same scenario will apply to VRT in relation to a CO2 rating that cannot be obtained.  CO2 ratings are not available for the vast bulk of the existing fleet.  Finally, I understand that the new motor tax systems based on CO2 emissions introduced by Cyprus, Netherlands, Portugal, United Kingdom and Norway were confined to new or pre-owned imported cars.  In addition, at EU level the proposal for a Council Directive on passenger car related taxes envisages its application to newly registered cars only.</p>

Essentially, the guidelines assist planning authorities to identify areas where there is significant wind energy potential.  These areas are then to be mapped in the development plan to provide clarity for the public, developers and the planning authority.  The guidelines require planning authorities to be favourably disposed to granting planning permission in those areas, subject to the siting and design criteria contained in the guidelines.  The guidelines identify 6 main topographical landscapes for the siting of wind turbines and contain extensive illustrations to demonstrate practical examples of what is, and is not, considered acceptable.

            <p eId="para_11150">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1314, 1331 and 1345 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11151">The Programme for Government commits to phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs in favour of more energy efficient alternatives.  More recently, in my Carbon Budget Statement of 6 December last, I announced that a minimum energy efficiency standard for lighting will be introduced from 2009 and advised that this measure will deliver emissions savings of up to 700,000 tonnes per year from residential lighting alone when incandescent bulbs are fully replaced in all domestic light fittings.  As modern energy efficient lights typically use only 20% as much energy as their incandescent alternatives and last up to 15 times longer, significant savings for consumers are possible.  According to the ESB, one compact fluorescent lamp could save up to €170 over the lifetime of the bulb.</p>
            <p eId="para_11152">Savings in electricity consumption from more energy efficient lighting will lead indirectly to a reduction in emissions from electricity generation.  As all electricity generation plants in Ireland are included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and have their emissions capped for the 2008-2012 period in advance, any reduction in emissions within the ETS sector during the period will not lead to any further reduction in Ireland's national distance to target for Kyoto Protocol compliance.  The emissions savings will however count towards the Government's domestic 3% average annual reduction commitment.  In formulating proposals for a minimum energy efficiency standard, it will be necessary to have regard to a range of factors, including the availability of alternative lamp technologies in the market to meet consumer requirements.  To this end, I have recently established an Inter Departmental Group on Energy Efficient Lighting to, inter alia, advise me on the technical basis on which such a standard might be developed, the potential impacts of the proposal on specific groups and any other relevant issues.  It is also my intention that the efficiency standards proposed will be subject to a public consultation and as part of this process, I propose to invite submissions from stakeholders that may be adversely affected.  Finally, as compact fluorescent bulbs are likely to become more widespread, I have asked the EPA to draw up guidelines on the safe disposal of these products.</p>

My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and I intend to implement the necessary measures starting in November 2008, following consultations with the relevant landowner stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_11156">Responsibility for storage of manual voting equipment has always been a matter for the local returning officers and so similar responsibility was assigned to them in regard to the electronic voting equipment. In the majority of cases, leases were entered into by them for the storage of the machines, which have a 20-year lifespan.  The Government decision to centralise storage of the electronic voting equipment was made taking into account a range of factors, including costs of local and centralised arrangements and the likely benefits to be realised; the majority of the electronic voting machines are now stored in containers at Gormanston Aerodrome.  The following table sets out information provided by returning officers regarding storage arrangements entered into by them in each of the 25 locations involved:</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_11267">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1317, 1413, 1417 and 1418 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11268">Under the decentralisation programme, all Dublin based operations of my Department are being decentralised, with the exception of Met Éireann, ENFO, the Private Rented Tenancies Board and a small co-ordination section which it is proposed to retain in Dublin to assist with the Department's Dáil and other business.  A total of 682 Dublin based posts will be transferred to four locations in the South East: Wexford (270 posts); Waterford (225 posts); New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts).  The original indicative timescales for the completion of the Department's offices in Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford as set out in the Progress Report (June 2005) from the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) were Q3 2007, End 2008, Early 2009 and Mid 2009 respectively.  However, as outlined in the most recent Progress Report from the DIG (September 2007), the indicative timescales for the completion of the Department's offices have been revised as follows, Q 3 2008, Q 4 2009, Q 2 2010 and Q 3 2010 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_11269">My Department established an advance office in Wexford, currently staffed by 40 people, which has been operational since 25 June 2007.  Of the 40 staff, one staff member transferred from an original location outside of Dublin and one staff member was recruited locally.  The remainder of the staff transferred from an original Dublin based location.  My Department's permanent offices in Wexford are currently under construction and it is expected that the remaining 230 posts, bringing the total to 270, will transfer to Wexford over the course of 2009.  At present a total of 177 staff, including those in the advance office, have applied to decentralise to Wexford.  The process of filling the posts due to transfer in 2009 is ongoing.  In addition my Department has almost 400 staff based in 40 regional locations across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_11270">The cost of procuring and fitting out office accommodation is a matter for the Office of Public Works (OPW).  In this regard OPW are currently managing construction of the Department's Headquarters in Wexford for which site acquisition costs amounted to €3.5m.  The annual leasing costs in respect of the advance office amount to €75,000 per annum while the fit out costs amounted to €206,000.   Procurement options for the accommodation in the remaining 3 locations are under consideration by OPW.  At the end of Q 3 2007 my Department had incurred €84,470 in respect of training, IT, travel and subsistence and miscellaneous accommodation costs under the decentralisation programme.  There are 8 Departmental staff directly involved in the administration of the decentralisation programme for my Department.  Other staff though not directly involved in administration provide support in areas such as training and communications.  The decentralisation programme also provides for the relocation of the Local Government Computer Services Board (91 posts) and the National Building Agency (48 posts) to Drogheda and Wexford respectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_11275">An Bord Pleanála (the Board) was established in 1977, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, primarily to allow independent consideration of planning authorities' decisions on planning applications in the event that such decisions are appealed.  The procedures for the appointment of ordinary members of An Bord Pleanála are set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by Sections 14-16 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006. In addition, Article 11 of the Planning and Development Regulations, 2006 amended the list of prescribed bodies for the purposes of making nominations to the Board.  These provisions require selections to be made by the Minister from nominees put forward by four representative panels of nominating bodies prescribed for this purpose.  The composition of each panel is listed in the table below.  The current Board includes appointees from each of the four representative panels.  Appointees to the Board do not represent their nominating body, but are appointed to provide, as a function of the Board, an independent consideration of planning authorities' decisions submitted to the Board on appeal.  I am satisfied that the current nomination and appointment processes are fair and transparent. Furthermore, as the legislative provisions underpinning these processes have only recently been endorsed by the Oireachtas, I have no proposals to make any further amendments at this time.</p>

Issues to be considered in the Green Paper will include the provision of directly elected mayors and the establishment of town councils in those towns that have shown significant population growth in recent years.  The Government Programme states that a directly elected Mayor for Dublin with executive powers will be introduced by 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_11329">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  Generally speaking, waiver schemes do not operate in respect of privately supplied collection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_11330">My Department understands that previous legal advice obtained by a local authority suggests that in an area which is serviced by the private sector the local authority may not provide a waiver in respect of charges for a service which is not directly provided by the local authority. However, a local authority does have discretion itself to provide a waste collection service, including a waiver of some or all of the charges which it may determine, or to procure competitively for a service provider to collect waste on its behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_11331">My Department has also completed a public consultation on issues surrounding the regulation of the waste management sector, including the need for any public service obligations in respect of collection services to certain households or in specific areas. Following my Department's consideration of over fifty, many very detailed, submissions received which cover a range of complex issues, I am developing policy proposals to address the issues arising in the context of waste regulation.</p>

            <p eId="para_11369">While my Department has received no specific proposals relating to the works in question, I understand that they may form part of the Blanchardstown Sewerage Scheme (Network) which is included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 as a scheme to advance through planning.  I also understand that Fingal County Council has appointed consultants to prepare a Preliminary Report for the scheme which will address all relevant habitat protection and natural amenity issues and which will be examined in my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_11510">There is no specific information available to my Department on the volume of plastic bottles sent to landfill.  All beverage containers, including plastic bottles, are packaging.  National waste statistics for all waste streams, including packaging, are published by the EPA with the most recent being the National Waste Report 2006, published yesterday. Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_11511">Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.  The National Waste Report 2006 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 57.3% in that year, indicating that Ireland continues to exceed the current target recovery rate of 50% set by the Packaging Directive.  This compares with a recovery rate of 14.8% in 1998.  Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive introduces a new increased packaging waste recovery target of 60% (with 55% by way of recycling) as well as material specific recycling targets for glass, paper/board, metals, plastics and wood. These targets, including the plastic packaging recovery target of 22.5%, have to be achieved by Ireland by 2011. The recovery rate for plastic packaging in 2006 was 20.7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_11512">I fully recognise that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance. The Programme for Government commits us to a comprehensive review of waste management planning, which I have directed my Department to initiate. This review will ensure that our waste management plans reflect best international practice and that we have the policies and infrastructure to meet ambitious environmental objectives.  The review will also look at the desirability of other producer responsibility schemes, including deposit and refund for beverage containers.</p>
            <p eId="para_11513">In the interim, I have recently challenged industry to develop appropriate measures to address packaging waste litter, in particular in relation to beverage containers.  At present, the arrangements for recovering packaging waste from consumers and householders consist principally of segregated collections for dry recyclables and an extensive network of bring banks and civic amenity sites.   My Department will continue to discuss these issues in the context of finalising a four-year strategy for the packaging waste sector which is currently being developed under the aegis of the National Strategy Group on Packaging Waste Recycling which is representative of the relevant public and private sector stakeholders.</p>

            <p eId="para_11516">Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person  who are entered in the register of electors. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Gardaí, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</p>

            <p eId="para_11595">Following on from a commitment in the Programme for Government in relation to school water charges, the Government decided on 4 January 2008 to introduce transitional arrangements for charging schools for water services, pending schools being charged for water services on a full cost recovery and volumetric basis with effect from 1 January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_11596">In summary, for 2007 a flat rate of €3.00 per pupil will apply (bills for 2007 are to be recalculated on this basis and schools given a credit in respect of any excess payment and outstanding bills for 2007 are to be revised on this basis); for 2008 a flat rate of €3.50 per pupil will apply, and for 2009 a flat rate of €4.00 per pupil will apply.  The relevant rates for schools receiving a water supply, but not waste water facilities, will be €2.25 in 2007, €2.63 in 2008 and €3.00 in 2009.  Apart from any readjustment to arrears for 2007 arising from the recalculation of bills at the rate of €3.00 per pupil, schools are legally liable to pay all other outstanding arrears, regardless of the number of years involved.  Schools owing arrears of water charges are being advised to discuss a payment arrangement for the outstanding arrears with the relevant local authority.   In order to comply with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, the transitional arrangements outlined above will terminate at the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_11597">The details of these arrangements have been communicated to local authorities and they have been advised that any reduction in income during the transitional period will be met through existing provisions within the Local Government Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_11598">Implementation of the Government Decision of 4 January 2008 in relation to school water charges does not require an amendment of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997 or of the European Communities (Water Quality) Regulations 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_11599">I have not had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, in respect of compensating schools for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in respect of 2008 as the funding of school running costs is a matter for her.</p>
            <p eId="para_11600">Local authorities are required to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes.  There is no provision for an exemption from water charges in the case of any non-domestic users, whether army barracks, garda stations, hospitals, airports, sports clubs, social welfare offices, Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food offices or Post Offices.  In accordance with existing legislation, only ordinary household use of water within a dwelling house is exempt from water charges.</p>

            <p eId="para_11626">Specific state support for the accommodation needs of older people or people with special housing needs ranges from grant schemes which allow people to remain in their homes to the provision of specific sheltered housing options.</p>
            <p eId="para_11627">Both the local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors are providing an expanded range of social housing options and a wide range of accommodation types to meet special housing needs, including in relation to sheltered housing with low-level, on-site supports. Sheltered housing usually comprises a group scheme of dwellings with provision for on-site delivery of services to allow for assisted independent living. For most vulnerable groups, interventions in this area generally require an inter-agency response particularly where there is a care dimension to the supports required.</p>
            <p eId="para_11628">My Department's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, sets out a new approach to social housing provision and a new focus on meeting individual needs by providing homes for life in safe and well-planned neighbourhoods. This approach allows supports to be geared to the particular needs of people in different phases of their life. For older people, grants to adapt their homes to address mobility problems can supplement other supports to enable them to continue living independently at home for as long as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_11629">A cross-departmental team on sheltered housing has been established by my Department to oversee progress in this area. Provision is being made for consultation with social partners through the Housing Forum.</p>

            <p eId="para_11631">The local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by authorities on or after 1 July 1986. One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.</p>

            <p eId="para_11667">In May 2006, my Department, in its role as prescribed body under the relevant planning regulations, was notified by Meath County Council in accordance with the provisions of Part 8 of those regulations of its intention to carry out the development referred to in the questions. My Department's National Monuments Service advised the Council that the proposed development was within the zone of archaeological potential established around the town of Nobber and recommended to the Council that an archaeological impact assessment of the proposed development site be carried out to assess the potential impact, if any, of the development on archaeological remains in the area where the development was proposed. This recommendation was not acted upon by the Council, who did not notify the Department of their decision in the matter, as requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_11668">During the course of the subsequent construction works the National Monuments Service was contacted by a local resident and was informed that archaeological material had been uncovered at the site.  My Department contacted the local authority about the implications of what had been uncovered and the local authority then employed an archaeologist to monitor further works at the development site.</p>
            <p eId="para_11669">Following confirmation of the presence of archaeological features at the site, a licence for archaeological excavations to determine the nature and extent of those features and to assist in deciding on any measures that might be possible at that stage to mitigate the archaeological impacts of the works was applied for by a firm of archaeological consultants on behalf of the Council. The licence was issued by my Department in late April 2007.  Subsequently, the National Monuments Service agreed a programme of further monitoring and recording with the Council's archaeological consultant in July 2007. The full programme of archaeological works was concluded in December 2007. A post-excavation preliminary report required as a condition of the excavation licence is due to be completed by the Council's archaeological consultant in February 2008 and submitted to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_11670">The determination of the costs of the archaeological works is a matter for Meath County Council in the first instance in consultation with its archaeological consultants. As funding for this local authority housing development is being provided by my Department to Meath County Council the Department has requested a breakdown of all relevant costs, including archaeological costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_11671">I have asked my Department to seek an urgent report from the local authority in relation to this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_11675">The €20 fee for making a submission on a planning application was introduced in the context of the comprehensive review of planning legislation which culminated in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  The fee was introduced in tandem with the increased rights given to 3rd parties in the planning process in the revised legislation.  Since the enactment of the 2000 Act planning authorities are statutorily obliged to acknowledge submissions on planning applications and to consider those submissions before making decisions on planning applications.  Persons who make submissions are also entitled to be notified of</p>
            <p eId="para_11676">any new information provided;</p>
            <p eId="para_11677">the decision of the planning authority;</p>
            <p eId="para_11678">an appeal against the decision of the planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_11679">This administrative framework is expensive to administer and the purpose of the €20 fee is to contribute to the increasing costs for planning authorities in administering the development consent system while not discouraging public participation in the process.  The fee also facilitates the identification of those persons who have made a submission on a planning application and who are therefore entitled to appeal decisions.  Further, the fee is payable once; if a person who has paid a fee makes a further submission or observation, no fee is payable in respect of the subsequent submission or observation.</p>
            <p eId="para_11680">My Department is currently examining the costs of the planning service with a view to reviewing the Regulations relating to planning application fees in the context of improving further service delivery.  Any proposed changes to the current fees structure, including the fee for making a submission on an application, will require the endorsement of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_11682">The compilation of a register of electors is a matter for the appropriate registration authority (City or County Council) in accordance with electoral law. In order to vote, a person's name must be entered on the register for a constituency in the state in which the person ordinarily resides and the person's citizenship determines the polls at which he or she is entitled to vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_11683">Irish citizens may vote at all polls; British citizens may vote at Dáil, European and local elections; other EU citizens may vote at European and local elections; and non-EU citizens may vote at local elections only.  Electors are entered on the register according to their eligibility to vote based on information furnished by them to the registration authority: Irish citizens are shown on the register with no letter after their names; British citizens have D after their names; other EU citizens an E; and non-EU citizens the letter L. Further information in relation to the registration process may be obtained from the relevant registration authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_11684">EU legislation relating to voting at European Parliament elections provides that persons who are not nationals of the member state in which they reside but who meet the same conditions in respect of the right to vote as that State imposes on its own nationals have the right to vote in that member state.  Within this framework, the relevant legislation provides for a system of declarations by EU citizens who are not nationals of the member state in which they reside, and of information exchange between the member states, to help ensure that no person votes more than once at such elections.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_11689">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1378, 1380, 1381 and 1388 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11690">Since the introduction of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, my Department has issued a range of implementation guidelines for local authorities.  In addition, the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP), working in conjunction with my Department, published a Resource Pack on concluding Part V agreements in 2006.  The Pack, which was updated in 2007, was developed on foot of a series of workshops held for local authority personnel, professionals involved in the Part V process and the Irish Home Builders Association (IHBA). It provides guidance on the various issues arising and includes a structured step by step framework to assist in reaching Part V agreements.  In terms of reaching early agreements, it emphasises the important role of meaningful pre-planning discussions between developers and local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_11691">Copies of the Resource Pack have been disseminated widely to all those involved in the implementation of the Part V process, including the IHBA.  The need for further guidance tailored to local circumstances is a matter for individual local authorities to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_11692">In addition, in the context of regional seminars for local authorities held by my Department and the AHP, the importance of ensuring that authorities make arrangements to support the efficient operation of Part V, involving both their housing and planning functions, has been highlighted.  The specific arrangements in this regard are a matter for individual local authority managers, as part of their overall responsibility for the management of their authority's staff and other resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_11693">My Department has also encouraged local authorities to take a proactive role in facilitating the involvement of the voluntary and co-operative sector in the provision of housing under Part V.  It is important that this is taken forward in a planned manner in each local authority area, in the context of the preparation and implementation of Housing Action Plans, which are the vehicle through which authorities plan for the delivery of housing programmes at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_11694">The range of measures outlined has played an important part in supporting delivery under Part V which, in 2006, increased by 60% on the previous year.  I expect that full year data for 2007 will, in due course, show another strong Part V performance.</p>

            <p eId="para_11700">In working to compile the Register for 2007/8, which is currently in force, local authorities undertook and completed the most extensive registration campaign in decades.

            <p eId="para_11735">Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  To guide local authorities in the preparation of these plans and in addressing key issues, my Department published Development Plan Guidelines for Planning Authorities in June 2007, emphasising that mandatory development objectives in the plan must include objectives for the provision, or facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches and other education and child care facilities.  The Guidelines take more significant and inclusive account of school planning, addressing the critical inter-relationship between land use and schools, and set the context for forward planning and engagement by local authorities with the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_11736">The Guidelines create a clear linkage between the objective for the provision of schools with the current guidelines used by the Department of Education and Science in relation to school accommodation.  Planning authorities are advised to secure the maximum degree of co-ordination with the Department of Education and Science in relation to school requirements and their future provision before land is zoned or re-zoned for substantial residential development. In this context my Department is working with the Department of Education and Science and the County and City Managers' Association to develop a new protocol to ensure the timely acquisition of school sites in newly developing and fast growth areas. This is one of a range of procedural initiatives being undertaken by my Department and the Department of Education and Science to strategically plan for and co-ordinate the delivery of schools in tandem with new development. The need for any necessary legislative changes to underpin this work is also being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_11751">At a global level, rising sea levels is one of the most serious concerns in relation to climate change and, as pointed out in Chapter 11 of the National Climate Change Strategy, it is already known that the Irish climate is experiencing changes consistent with those occurring at a global scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_11752">The 2007 Fourth Assessment Report from the InterGovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points to the fact that global average sea-level rose by 1.8mm per year between 1961 and 2003.  This rate has increased to 3.1mm per year between 1993 and 2003 but it is not clear if this faster rate represents a new norm or part of a long-term cycle.  Total sea-level rise over the 20th Century is 0.17m, with thermal expansion and melting of land ice estimated to have contributed about half of the recently observed rise.  Potential accelerated sea-level rise due to increased ice melt is a significant threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_11753">In a 2006 research project on the Implications of the EU Climate Protection Target for Ireland which was undertaken for the EPA, the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Unit at the Department of Geography, National University of Ireland, Maynooth, point out, inter alia, that "in Ireland, the impacts of sea level rise will be most apparent in the major coastal cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick.  Counties in the south-east will be most affected, having sandy and mud cliff coastlines.  Other low-lying areas such as Louth and North Dublin may be affected as they have little or no protection.  The major effects will be a loss of land due to inundation and increased erosion and increased risk of flooding both in the coast and along major rivers during storm surge events.".</p>

            <p eId="para_11756">Both the local authorities and the voluntary housing sector are providing an expanded range of social housing options and a wide range of accommodation types to meet special housing needs, including those in need of sheltered housing with low-level, on-site supports.  For vulnerable groups, interventions in this area generally require an inter-agency response particularly where there is a care dimension to the supports required.</p>

            <p eId="para_11880">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1424, 1428, 1432 and 1433 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11881">EU law on the promotion of renewable energy resources in the electricity market (Directive 2001/77/EC), precludes member states from defining electricity from energy storage systems as "renewable energy sourced electricity".  It is not possible, therefore, to amend domestic legislation to give priority dispatch to electricity produced from such energy storage systems as renewable energy sourced electricity.</p>
            <p eId="para_11882">Energy storage has been developed over the years in Ireland where it can make a useful contribution to balancing electricity supply and consumer demand.  This is the case at the ESB's pumped water power station at Turlough Hill.  Compressed air storage is widely used at small scale within industry, but not generally for power generation at significant scale.  It is possible that new technology developments could enhance the viability of storage options in the future.  Developments will be kept under close review by my Department in consultation with EirGrid and the energy sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_11883">Under the National Development Plan energy reserve storage including gas and oil, is highlighted as a national strategic priority.  A study of the possible options for gas storage on an all-island basis has recently been completed and is being considered by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry Northern Ireland.  My Department has recently commissioned a review of Ireland's access to oil supplies and storage options. Both of these studies will critically inform future decisions to enhance security of energy supply, in relation to gas and oil.</p>
            <p eId="para_11884">The "All Island Grid Study" published earlier this month, examines the ability of the electricity systems on an All-Island basis to absorb power from renewable energy powered projects.  Its finding shows that a target of 42% is feasible.  The Study is not prescriptive on the alternative technologies, including pumped storage, which a liberalised electricity market may bring forward to balance customer demand and supply as the renewable energy powered capacity increases.</p>

            <p eId="para_11900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1427 and 1463 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11901">It is a matter for market players to bring forward proposals for new dispatchable plants in the competitive electricity generation market.  Under the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for the issue of licences to generate electricity and authorisations to construct power generation plants.  EirGrid is responsible for the provision of grid connection offers.  In that context both the CER and EirGrid will continue to monitor and progress proposals by market players for the provision of mid merit flexible plant.  I am firmly of the view that additional flexible plant is critically needed to support the growth of renewable energy and a balanced power generation portfolio.</p>
            <p eId="para_11902">I am advised by the CER that there is currently significant interest in developing mid-merit/flexible generating plant.  I welcome this interest by market players.  The CER published a direction to EirGrid in December 2007 to issue a connection offer for a proposed 98MW Open Cycle Gas Turbine plant at Purcellsinch in Co. Kilkenny. EirGrid has also received grid connection applications for another four 100MW flexible generating units in Tipperary, Mayo and Roscommon, which are currently under consideration.  I fully expect and will encourage investors in new generation to take account of the need for increased plant flexibility and to deliver the least cost and most appropriate plant technology for new generation capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_11909">A complex mapping exercise was undertaken in order to identify all areas where broadband services are and are not available.  My Department and ComReg contacted service providers and requested details of their current and planned broadband coverage.  Areas that are not currently served but are expected to be served by 1 July 2008 will not be covered by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  However, if those areas remain unserved on 1 July, 2008, the NBS winning Service Provider will be permitted to serve those areas under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_11910">Details of broadband services available throughout the country are available on my Department's Broadband website www.broadband.gov.ie which shows DSL and Wireless broadband coverage available in any area.</p>
            <p eId="para_11911">In addition, as part of the Procurement Process for the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), a complex mapping exercise was undertaken to identify all areas where broadband services are and are not available.

            <p eId="para_11912">The final product that customers will receive from the NBS will be an always on service of at least 1Mbit/s down and 128kbits/s up.  Service Providers are also required to offer improved products in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_11913">Worldwide, the telecommunications sector is focusing its investment plans on what has become knows as Next Generation Networks (NGNs), which are likely to see the delivery of higher-bandwidth broadband services over fibre-optic infrastructure.  I understand many of the service providers in Ireland are formulating plans for the rollout of NGNs.  My Department is currently considering policy options in relation to the optimum role for Government in encouraging and facilitating the planning and rollout of next generation broadband in Ireland, including how existing Government owned infrastructure, and possible future government investment, could help achieve national policy objectives in this area.  I expect to publish a draft policy paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks for public consultation in the coming months.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_1635">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_11915">I am advised that EirGrid's Ancillary Services currently pay for the services needed for operating reserve, reactive power and black start which are essential for system security.  These services are an operational matter for EirGrid as the State Body responsible for system security and generation adequacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_11916">EirGrid informs me that operating reserve arises in the event of a loss of output from a generator, group of generators or an interconnector, or an unexpected change in system demand.  Generators must provide a fast acting response to make up the shortfall in generation and units are paid for being available to provide this response.  When the reserve is utilised, generators are paid for the additional energy supplied through the energy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_11917">The second ancillary service relates to reactive power.  I understand from EirGrid that generation units can vary their effect on the system voltage to compensate for transmission lines losses and customer loads.  The provision of reactive power by all generation units for voltage support is vital to maintain a secure and stable transmission system.</p>
            <p eId="para_11918">In addition, "black start" is a vital system service whereby electricity can be provided to the transmission system by generators who have a separate power source on-site which can start the generator independently of the grid.  This service enables the system to restart in the event of a major incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_11919">EirGrid has provided the following table, which shows details of the amounts paid for each of these services for the period 2003 to end October, 2007:</p>

            <p eId="para_11976">Throughout the period in question the sources of Ireland's natural gas supply have been indigenous production combined with imports from the UK to Ireland via sub-sea gas interconnection to the Moffat entry point located onshore in Scotland.  The source of imported supply has largely been the North Sea although this situation is changing as the UK has moved to become a net gas importer.  UK gas import come from a range of sources and by a variety of routes from Continental Europe and from Norway.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_12057">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1440, 1442, 1444 and 1466 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12058">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_12059">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).  There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_12060">The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates were, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_12061">Following the withdrawal of the IFA/Motorola Consortium as a candidate the remaining three candidates have now commenced "Competitive Dialogue" with the Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_12062">Details of broadband services available throughout the country are available on my Department's Broadband website www.broadband.gov.ie  which shows DSL and wireless broadband coverage available in any area.  In addition, as part of the Procurement Process for the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), a complex mapping exercise was undertaken to identify all areas where broadband services are and are not available.  This map is available on my Department's main website www.dcenr.ie.</p>

I do not propose to make public the funding allocated to the NBS as knowledge of the estimated cost could influence the negotiation process currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_12066">While the NBS is technology neutral, the technical standards to be provided by the winning Service Provider will be fully specified in the NBS contract.  Currently it is envisaged that a minimum of 1Mbps download and 128kbps upload speed with a maximum of 48:1 contention ratio will be provided. Service Providers are also required to offer improved products in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_12101">Virtually every computer or network connected to the internet is being probed for vulnerabilities by third parties.  My Department's network is no exception, and it receives a high volume of spurious traffic.  There is no record kept of these probes.  The traffic is stopped by firewalls on the Department's IT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_12102">All traffic that is permitted through the external firewall is inspected by a network Intrusion Detection System, which monitors the perimeter of the network for suspicious activity.  This device inspects the millions of packets of data that enter and leave the network daily.  Most of this traffic is legitimate, including email, Internet access by staff, et cetera, but if there are suspicious packets of data addressed to the Department's network on a daily basis, these are identified, inspected, catalogued and logged by the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_12103">Over the last nine months the analysis of incoming traffic by the system has not identified any attempt to hack or infiltrate the network, however, there have been over 65,000 occurrences of spyware, viruses, malware, et cetera, recognised by the system.  The objective of all these is, of course, to compromise computers on the network.</p>
            <p eId="para_12104">In addition to the intrusion detection system there are additional safeguards in the form of secondary firewalls, web content filtering, multiple anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti spam devices installed to block dangerous traffic and protect the network.  The portfolio of measures that operates to protect the network of the Department would be considered best practice in the State or private sectors.</p>

I intend to work very closely with my EU colleagues in the negotiation of the Directive to ensure that all biofuels placed on the European and Irish market are produced in line with all appropriate sustainability criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_12118">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1452 to 1455, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_12119">The House of Tomorrow, as with all of Sustainable Energy Ireland's (SEI) grant programmes, involves the disbursement of Exchequer funding to private sector clients for the installation and/or demonstration of a variety of different sustainable energy technologies and solutions.  In all SEI programmes the particular qualifying criteria are specified in the application guide and forms.  Where commercial companies are involved, such as with the House of Tomorrow programme, SEI verifies that the grant recipient has a valid tax clearance certificate, both at the time of application and at the time of any grant payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_12120">The Application Guide for the House of Tomorrow programme also includes the provision that the goals and requirements of the Programme do not supersede existing Building Regulations and planning requirements.  Where some aspects of energy efficient design might challenge prevailing building standards, applicants are encouraged to make reference to the Department of the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government's Social Housing Design Guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_12121">In 2007, the allocation within SEI's capital budget for the House of Tomorrow programme was €8m.  This was to allow for the discharge of grant payments maturing under this programme.  This budget was fully spent by end 2007.  SEI made payments in 2007 to 68 approved grantees.  In 2007, SEI also approved grants for, and issued letters of offer to, a total of 34 new projects under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_12122">The House of Tomorrow programme opened in 2001 and by July 2007 had committed grants to housing developments comprising around 6,000 units.  The programme closed for applications in June, arising from the Government's announcement of the proposed revision of Part L of the Building Regulations to require energy and CO2 performance levels in new homes similar to those which had been demonstrated as achievable through the House of Tomorrow programme.  These levels are some 40% higher than the current regulations require.  The proposed revisions to the regulations, together with these new performance requirements, were published in September for consultation by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_12123">In light of these developments it was decided to discontinue grant aid for new projects in respect of standards that are intended to be made mandatory.  The strong interest in the House of Tomorrow programme in the period prior to the closure meant that there was a large number of grant applications still being processed.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has also committed to reviewing the regulations in 2010 to achieve 60% above current levels, with the ultimate aim of achieving a zero carbon standard for new houses in the medium to long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_12124">Given the proposed revisions of the regulations, the grant applications in hand under the House of Tomorrow Programme were subject to detailed review to establish whether, on the basis of possible achievement of such a 60% performance level, support could be warranted.  Any applicant who has not qualified for funding under the Programme would have received an explanatory letter outlining the reasons from SEI.</p>

         the progress that has been made to date in the development of a land-bank of ESB owned sites to facilitate independent power generation investment; the results of the launch of the sales process for sites committed for divestment in 2007 under the CER-ESB Asset Strategy Agreement including those at Shannonbridge/Lanesboro and Poolbeg 3; and when he expects independent power generation operators to begin generation at those sites.

            <p eId="para_12160">EirGrid has been asked to work with the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in developing options for a State owned landbank and preliminary analysis is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_12161">The process of divestment of ESB sites is a commercial matter for the Board and Management of the ESB  in accordance with the terms of the Asset Strategy Agreement with the Commission for Energy Regulation and not one in which I have a direct role.  However, I understand that the process has commenced with a request by ESB for the submission of indicative bids.  A further short-listing will precede the selection of final preferred bidders.  My approval for any disposal of assets will be required.  The CER has responsibility for monitoring ESB's compliance with the terms of the Asset Strategy, designed to reduce ESB's market share in power generation to 40% in an all-island context.</p>
            <p eId="para_12162">Under the Electricity Act, 1999, the CER has statutory responsibility for the issue of licences to generate electricity and authorisations to construct or reconstruct power generation plants.  Accordingly, decisions in due course by the ultimate purchasers regarding the commencement of power generation on those sites will be a commercial matter for the entities concerned, subject to CER authorisation and not one in which I have a function.</p>

            <p eId="para_12164">My Department has developed and maintains a number of systems that contain personal data in addition to internal systems such as payroll or HR.  These include an Integrated Fisheries Information System, a Foreshore Coastal Zone Management System, a Marine Vessel Registration System, a Mineral Exploration Licensing System, and a Petroleum Exploration System.  Although the functions supported by most of these applications have been transferred to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and to the Minister for Transport, my Department continues to manage and maintain them at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_12165">There is one potential compromise of personal data that my Department is aware of in the time frame referred to by the question.  The Integrated Fisheries Information System is used by the Sea Fisheries Division of the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food.  On the weekend of the 2nd to the 5th November 2007, following a software upgrade, a defect was introduced into the system whereby a registered "Sales Notes" user could search for and view information on fish sales associated with other customers of the Department.  Whilst this information did not include personal information it did identify the vessel name.</p>
            <p eId="para_12166">The vulnerability was in place for seventy hours and just two individuals accessed the search facility in that time.  Shortly after the fault being brought to the Department's attention, the system was disabled and the fault rectified.

            <p eId="para_12174">As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, the headquarters of my Department is scheduled to relocate to Cavan at the end of 2009.  This will involve the relocation of approximately 300 posts.  19 staff members transferred as an advance party to Cavan prior to 31st December 2006, with a further 26 transferring during 2007 bringing the total working there at present to 45.  Current plans envisage this figure being augmented by approximately a further nine staff in 2008.  In addition, my Department continues to progress 120 potential applications from civil servants who have expressed an interest in relocating to Cavan.</p>
            <p eId="para_12175">No staff members are designated exclusively to the decentralisation work area.

            <p eId="para_12201">As part of the Government's decentralisation programme, the headquarters of my Department is scheduled to relocate to Cavan at the end of 2009.  An advance party of 45 is currently in situ in Cavan of which 40 were Dublin based and five were non-Dublin based.  Current plans envisage this figure being augmented by approximately a further nine staff in 2008, the majority of whom will be relocating from Dublin based departments.</p>
