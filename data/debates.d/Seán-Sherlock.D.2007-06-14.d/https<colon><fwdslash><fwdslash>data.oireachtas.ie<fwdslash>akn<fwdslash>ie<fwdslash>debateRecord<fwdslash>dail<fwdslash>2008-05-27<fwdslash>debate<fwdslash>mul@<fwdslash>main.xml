            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">Having regard to the confidential nature of the work of the National Security Committee, it would not be appropriate to disclose information about the dates of individual meetings nor any of its proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">The committee is chaired by the Secretary General to the Government and comprises representatives at the highest level of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Foreign Affairs and the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  It is concerned with ensuring that I and the Government are advised of high level security issues and the responses to them, but not involving operational security matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">The committee meets as required and will continue to do so.  In addition to their meetings, the members liaise on an ongoing basis to monitor developments that might have national security implications, in particular in the international arena.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I raised this matter with the Taoiseach's predecessor on several occasions and was informed that people with direct links with al-Qaeda cell groups were living in this country and were under close scrutiny by the Garda.  Since his accession has the Taoiseach been briefed by security authorities on this matter?  Will he comment on whether there is any evidence of al-Qaeda-linked cells operating in or living either in the Dublin area or in the country?</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Is he also aware of the clear threat of international terrorism in that al-Qaeda has threatened to target the forthcoming European football championships?  In view of our proximity to the west coast of Britain, is the Taoiseach satisfied that the protections in place at Sellafield will stand up to any possible threat or attack?  Has he consulted on this matter with his counterpart, Prime Minister Gordon Brown?  If he has not discussed this with Mr. Brown, is it his intention to do so, in light of the statement from al-Qaeda to target the forthcoming European championships?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">We are all aware in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks and other more recent outrages of the scale of the threat posed by international terrorism.  While there are no grounds to suggest that Ireland is at particular risk, the security services maintain a high state of vigilance.  They are also in regular contact with other security services and there is an ongoing exchange of information and intelligence through fora such as Europol and Eurojust.  It would not be appropriate to speculate on the matter of what persons may or may not be linked to terrorist organisations, except to assure the Deputy that the Garda Síochána closely monitors the security situation on an ongoing basis.  This would include any activities that might pose a threat to international security.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">The committee has an advisory role to ensure the Taoiseach and the Government are apprised of high-level security issues and the responses to them.  The security services keep in close contact on these matters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_12">Can I take it the Taoiseach will raise the matter of security with his counterpart, Gordon Brown, when the opportunity presents, particularly in light of the European championships?</p>
            <p eId="para_13">On the Order of Business in the House last week I raised the matter of damage to a number of vehicles during transportation to Chad.  The Taoiseach will be aware that this is a logistically complex and very dangerous operation.  Can I take it he has spoken to the Minister for Defence and that the necessary arrangements are in place to ensure our troops there are properly and fully equipped and that if these vehicles have either to be repaired or replaced this would be done forthwith?</p>
            <p eId="para_14">What is the view of the Taoiseach and the Government of the threat posed by dissident republican groups on this island?  He will be aware of the Independent Monitoring Commission's 18th report which refers specifically to Óglaigh na hÉireann.  It states that in the period of the 18th review, this group was more than likely responsible for the murder of Andrew Burns in County Donegal on 12 February 2008.  This is the first murder attributed to this group.  The Taoiseach will be aware that in December 2007 Óglaigh na hÉireann launched a pipe-bomb attack on Strabane PSNI station.  The report also refers specifically to the Irish Republican Liberation Army, the IRLA, and its involvement in the centre in the Ardoyne area of Belfast.  The report is very specific in its references to these two groups.  The IMC states in the report that all of these groups are aware of the publicity attracted once an incident occurs.  Has the Taoiseach had discussions on this 18th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission?  This is an objective and independent report.  There is a clear threat of whatever magnitude.  Has the Taoiseach an up to date position on this matter?  Has he a current estimate of the numbers involved, whether it is ten, 20, 50 or less than 100?  Is it the Taoiseach's considered view that either of these groups, or both of them, have the capacity to carry out a major act of violence either in the Republic or elsewhere on the island of Ireland?  Is that the information available to the Government?  Perhaps the Taoiseach could comment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_15">Earlier I said in relation to terrorist threats that the security services are constantly monitoring and liaising with other security services, as appropriate, to deal with that matter.  I do not think there is any benefit in saying more about it, other than that, so it will not be misinterpreted one way or the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The situation in Chad is outside the remit of these questions.  Operational matters are dealt with by the Minister for Defence.  If the Deputy tables a written or oral parliamentary question to that effect, he will get an accurate reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">As regards the question of dissident activity, the IMC report was positive but there is always a problem with some small dissident groups.  Thankfully, our security services, including the Garda Síochána, have been very successful to date in ensuring the nefarious activities of such groups have not brought about the mayhem, or worse, that they have been contemplating.  Monitoring has been taking place successfully in this respect and we are glad to report that such attempts have been thwarted.  Gardaí will be particularly mindful of that issue in their efforts to quell any activity from that quarter, which has no mandate from anyone and must be dealt with firmly within the law.  That includes bringing criminal proceedings where necessary and where evidence can be obtained and collated.  It is an ongoing operational matter that the Garda Commissioner and his senior colleagues are co-ordinating.  I commend them for the work they have been doing so far.  I hope they will continue to be successful in thwarting those who seek to undermine everything that everyone else is trying to achieve.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_20">The specific questions are about the operation of the committee and I appreciate that, for understandable reasons, the Taoiseach does not want to get into the committee's operational work.  However, will the Taoiseach provide a general assessment of the extent to which people may feel reasonably secure that the Government and the State's security services, working with other security and intelligence services, are on top of the threat from terrorism?  People are going about their normal business and are travelling abroad on planes or ships, as well as attending major events.  Can the Taoiseach give them an assurance that our security services, working with other security services, are on top of the threat from terrorism?  What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the situation in this country?  Are we talking about a relatively small number of people who are posing, or are likely to pose, a terrorist risk?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_21">The Government is satisfied that the necessary structures are in place to obtain, assess and act on intelligence concerning the threat posed by terrorism, including international terrorism.  The highest priority continues to be placed by the Government and the security services on identifying and countering any threats that may have implications for this country.  Obviously, there is ongoing liaison both bilaterally in terms of working with other intelligence services and also in the context of Europol and Eurojust, which is another indication of the importance of the European connection in this matter in terms of security and justice matters generally.  Given the nature of terrorism and what it represents, there are absolutely no grounds for complacency.  One must be mindful of the need to continue to monitor to the greatest possible extent.  There are no guarantees in this line of work but, as I said, we are satisfied the necessary structures are in place to obtain, assess and act on intelligence and considerable resources are devoted to that effort.  This has become more complex in view of the international nature of it.  The source of that terrorist activity has changed.  Clearly, it poses continuing challenges in terms of being able to track people who may be suspect or who may need to be monitored for any period they happen to be here.  That depends very much on the level of co-ordination with services outside this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">A significant effort is being applied internationally and within the European Union also to deal with that matter.  I do not think it serves any purpose for me to say any more than that since it is an operational matter dealt with by those charged to deal with it who are expert in that area and who have considerable experience, unfortunately, in terms of our own domestic situation in trying to keep tabs on some of these activities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_23">I wish to pursue a little further with the Taoiseach the extent, or his assessment of the extent, of the terrorist threat or the terrorist related activity within the State.  The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 allows the Garda to obtain the personal telephone records of persons who are suspects for terrorist offences which carry prison sentences of five years or more.  The last year for which figures are available is 2006.  According to those figures, 10,000 requests were made by the Garda in 2006 for access to personal telephone records.  That is approximately 30 per day, which would suggest that the extent of terrorist related activity is much higher within the State than most of us would have thought.  Will the Taoiseach indicate why such a high number of requests were made by the Garda for access to personal telephone records in its investigations on terrorist related activities in 2006?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_24">We cannot draw an inference from the numbers mentioned by the Deputy as to the number of people who have been genuinely suspect; in other words, that relates to calls as I understand it.  Therefore, in terms of a question, the matter could best be placed before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who would have a more direct line of responsibility for this matter than me.  I am simply advised generally as to the situation through the national security committee.  I do not think the inference the Deputy may be drawing is necessarily the case in terms of the numbers being monitored.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_25">Has the interdepartmental group in question discussed the implications of the Government's ongoing accommodation of US military flights at Shannon Airport en route to its war in Iraq?  Given that we are currently hosting an international conference that is addressing the whole issue of cluster munitions, whose intent I wish every success, what assurance can the Taoiseach give that the flights using Shannon Airport are not themselves transporting cluster munitions to its war arena in Iraq?</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Does the Taoiseach agree that, as these questions are all in the context of post-11 September 2001, there are, indeed, security implications and that we would have justification in being concerned for the people who are employed at Shannon and those who live in close proximity to it by the ongoing presence, regular and recurrent, of US military aircraft and with all the questions that have arisen and have not been satisfactorily answered in relation to the potential use of that facility and those planes for the transportation of prisoners by means of rendition, a term which has entered into the vocabulary?  Does the Taoiseach not accept that the assurances of what I regard as the discredited Bush regime in relation to the whole matter of the war in Iraq are not sufficient, are simply not good enough and do not quell the justifiable concerns, questions and fears of the Irish people?  Does the Taoiseach not believe that it would be appropriate to assuage public fear and establish the truth of the matter that the Garda should be instructed to carry out routine and regular checks of these aircraft to establish whether they were transporting prisoners and whether unacceptable munitions such as cluster munitions were being accommodated on such flights?</p>

            <p eId="para_27">The role of the committee that is the subject of these questions is to ensure that I and the Government are kept advised of high level security issues and the responses to those issues.  The committee has no role in relation to the wider policy or political issues of the type raised by the Deputy and, therefore, they are not relevant to this question.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I do not understand how these matters would be irrelevant to the remit of the committee.  Our understanding is that this is an interdepartmental group on security established in the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001.  Surely the potential for an attack, which has been raised on many occasions by different voices in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 and in the fact that the Government continues to accommodate US military overflights and landing opportunities at Shannon Airport, is very much within the remit and context of the interdepartmental group's brief.</p>

Surely the group should have such a role if it is tasked with addressing national security issues.  Surely this is a matter of national security concern which would merit address by this interdepartmental group.  Will the Taoiseach explain why the group has apparently not addressed these matters heretofore?  Will he not now consider that it should address them?</p>

            <p eId="para_31">No, Ireland has made overflight and landing facilities available to the United States for more than 50 years.  This matter had nothing to do with the setting up of the interdepartmental committee, nor is it relevant to it.  Aircraft wishing to carry munitions of war on Irish territory can only do so with the permission of the Minister for Transport in the case of civilian aircraft and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the case of foreign military aircraft.  There have been no applications for the transport of such munitions.  As I said, the arrangements that are in place in Shannon Airport have been in place for decades under successive Governments.</p>

While I do not intend to overstate the position, does the Taoiseach agree that if the interdepartmental group were to examine the attacks of 11 September 2001, it would immediately ascertain that we could do nothing in the event of a similar incident taking place here?  Are plans in place to deal with the possibility, however remote, of a similar event occurring here?  Are there plans to purchase equipment to permit us to deal with such an event?</p>

The Department deals with contingency planning in that area and what the military would be required to do to assist in the event of any such attack taking place.  Considerable work has been done in the emergency planning area.  The office of emergency planning was set up shortly after the events of 11 September 2001 to co-ordinate the work of the various emergency services in preparing contingency plans.  The task force on emergency planning, which is chaired by the Minister for Defence, meets frequently to assist in that role.  If the Deputy has further queries on the policies formulated since then, he should direct them to the Minister for Defence.  The national security committee informs us of high level security matters, but we do not get involved in the operational aspects.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">Does the Taoiseach agree that the changes introduced by the Government to the Freedom of Information Act have seriously curtailed the right of the citizen to find out what is going on in certain areas, agencies and organisations?  The Taoiseach is always interested in outcomes and delivery.  Is he happy that many of the Departments in the public service fail consistently to provide on time the information sought under the Acts?  There is a specific requirement that even if the information is restricted, it should at least be delivered on time, but that is not happening in a range of areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The Information Commissioner issued a report at the tenth anniversary conference on 15 May.  She stated there is no good reason that key bodies, such as the Garda Síochána, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, vocational education committees and their schools, the State Examinations Commission and the CAO, should not be subject to the scrutiny which is provided for under the Freedom of Information Acts.  She says there is no justification for this state of affairs in Ireland and that we are the only country where practice is significantly out of line with virtually all of the 70 other countries where freedom of information legislation applies.  It is not that these bodies are deliberately doing something illegal but should it not be the citizen's right to find out what is going on, why and how decisions were made?</p>
            <p eId="para_89">Does the Taoiseach agree with the Information Commissioner's report on the tenth anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act that it should be extended to bodies such as those listed so that this can be made more open?  We are campaigning in favour of the Lisbon treaty on the basis that the Council, the Parliament and the Commission will sit in public and let people see what is going on and how decisions are made.  In our country, we are out of line with 70 other countries where freedom of information applies.  While nothing illegal is being done, does the Taoiseach agree it should be made more open?</p>

            <p eId="para_91">I was about to make the point that the Minister for Finance is responsible for its implementation, review and extension.  When freedom of information legislation was first introduced, it applied to 67 bodies or agencies.  The largest extension took place in 2006 when I was Minister for Finance and I extended it to a further 137 bodies, giving a total of 502 regarding the number of bodies to which freedom of information applies.  It has increased from 67 to 502 bodies in ten years.  While the Information Commissioner speaks of it being out of line with 70 other countries, my recollection of the Bill being brought before the House by a previous Administration was that it was quite progressive in terms of the method by which information can be sought.  My recollection is that it is far less restrictive than is the case across the water.  I cannot discuss that in detail today but I can give my impression.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">There has been a broadening of the bodies to which this legislation applies and whether and how it should be extended beyond the current number is a matter for ongoing consideration by the Minister for Finance.  There is nothing axiomatic about the figure of 502 at present.  It may well be extended in the future.  The report to which the Deputy refers was issued recently and may obtain consideration within the Department and by the Minister in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">I do not agree that the 2003 changes greatly restricted freedom of information.  It is quite the contrary; there are far more bodies to which it applies.  The idea was to bring balance to the situation and ensure that we have appropriate use of the Act.  Personal information is available in all situations for people to whom the Act applies.  It is important that this is done in a timely manner, that there is an internal review situation and that appeals can be made.  I am not aware of the specifics to which the Leader of the Opposition refers.  In the main, the Act, as applied by various officers in charge of its implementation, is applied at arms length from the heads of the organisations concerned and works quite well.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Yes.  I am drawing the two issues together.  The Minister is refusing to change the fee regime.  The Information Commissioner has stated that the fee regime is causing people not to make applications.  The table which the Taoiseach promised to circulate, of which we have not yet had sight but which I presume will be in line with previous replies, will show there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of applications made under the Freedom of Information Act since the introduction of the fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">Another aspect of this is the review of the legislation.  The Information Commissioner has asked for the extension of the Freedom of Information Act to additional bodies and the Taoiseach has responded to that request.  The commissioner, in the course of her address to the tenth anniversary event, asked for a thorough review of the Freedom of Information Act.  Does the Government intend to carry out a thorough review of that Act?  What direction will such a review take?  Will it focus on increasing or further restricting application of the Freedom of Information Act?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_30">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_98">I do not accept application of the Act has been further restricted given we have been extending the numbers of bodies to which it applies.  I have just explained to the Deputy that in 2006 alone, during my time as Minister for Finance, I extended it to a further 137 bodies.  I do not accept, therefore, that our attempt is to restrict it.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">Deputy Gilmore referred to fees which are, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I understand there are no plans to review fees.  The current system of fees was introduced in 2003.  A fee of €15 is modest particularly when compared with the estimated average administrative cost of €485 for processing a freedom of information request.  I do not believe anyone could argue this is unreasonable or that it discourages responsible FOI requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">It is important to point out that there is no charge for the time taken to examine the records sought with a view to determining whether they should be released.  There is no charge for access to personal information.  The fees have not been increased since their introduction in July 2003.  Regarding appeal fees, it is €75 for an internal appeal and €150 for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  There are significant reductions for medical card holders, the fees for whom are €25 and €50 respectively.  Appeals concerning personal information are entirely exempt from these fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">An appeal to the Information Commissioner is a quasi judicial process that can require many months to complete and can entail a considerable amount of work.  The fee in this regard is a fair reflection of the nature of the appeals process and of the costs and time involved.  It is important to note that a person who appeals to the commissioner receives a preliminary decision which is a fairly good indication of the likely final outcome.  Even at this late stage in the process, the requester can withdraw an appeal and obtain a full refund of fees paid.  I understand that approximately 30% of appeals made to the Office of the Information Commissioner are withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">Arrangements are in place to examine whether the Act can be extended to other groups of bodies including the Law Reform Commission, the last remaining body under the aegis of my Department to be included.  The Minister for Finance reviews these matters on an ongoing basis.  As I understand it, there are no proposals to extend the Act to the Garda Síochána.  While this has not been ruled out in the future, the matter is not currently under consideration.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_103">Is the Taoiseach considering any changes to the Freedom of Information Act, in particular, in respect of the claims expressed in the OECD's recent report that requests for freedom of information should be free?  Has that particular section of the OECD report been brought to the Taoiseach's attention?  It acknowledges that applying fees has addressed some of the frivolity involved in requests but it also knows and has evidence that it is a prohibition to genuine information being sought and accessed.  I know the Taoiseach is holding to one line of reply, but this is not only about the Information Commissioner.  The OECD report and substantial independent opinion believe the fee structuring is prohibitive.  How will the Taoiseach reply to the OECD report recommendations?</p>
            <p eId="para_104">Is the Taoiseach aware of the issues highlighted by the Information Commissioner with regard to the roles and functions of Departments or other bodies prescribed under the FOI Act being moved to newly established bodies with the records moving with them?  Heretofore, the records were under the attention of the FOI Act and were accessible.  Now that they are under a new body not yet listed they are not accessible for FOI inquiries.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Two examples were cited.  Records previously held by the Department of Transport transferred to the Road Safety Authority on its establishment in September 2006.  The Road Safety Authority is not one of the listed bodies.  Records once accessible under the FOI Act are no longer so.  The establishment in 2006 of the Property Registration Authority which took over the functions of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds is another example of public record information previously accessible under the FOI Act no longer being the case.  Does the Taoiseach consider that part of the core criteria of establishment of new bodies such as the Road Safety Authority and the Property Registration Authority should be that they are automatically registerable under the terms of the FOI Act?</p>

If records were available under the FOI Act and are now held by new bodies not in the existing orders I am sure the Minister for Finance will examine the logic of having people in the new agencies competent to deal with the matter.

Under the Freedom of Information Act in Northern Ireland, there is widespread availability of information for citizens on the PSNI.  This is denied only in specific and exceptional circumstances.  Now that the Garda Síochána is being reformed, does the Taoiseach have a view on whether the FOI Act should be extended to it?</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I look forward to the Minister for Finance coming to the House with a new and broad range of proposals on the Freedom of Information Act.  In the past, he expressed himself as a liberal on these issues, stating that people should have access to this information, that the Government, its agencies and public departments do not do anything illegal and therefore citizens should be aware of these things.  I look forward to the Minister for Finance, with the <i>imprimatur </i>of the Taoiseach, telling us what he will do.</p>

The information might be interesting to some people but whether it is of public interest in the wider commonly understood sense of that term is a different question</p>

            <p eId="para_117">Following the announcement by Dublin City Council on Monday, 19 May 2008, that a number of regeneration projects being carried out through PPP arrangements would not proceed as planned, my Department and the council met to examine the implications of the announcement for the projects concerned.  The city council has informed the Department that, while the developer in question has not formally withdrawn from the projects, he has indicated that due to the adversely changed circumstances of the current private housing market, along with additional costs cited due to increased apartment sizes and new energy requirements, the approach under which the projects were tendered is unsustainable in the current market.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">I understand that a further meeting between the council and the developer concerned took place yesterday and, arising from this, the developer is to submit proposals to the council by Thursday of this week, setting out an approach through which he considers the projects might be taken forward.  The council has undertaken to consider these proposals as a matter of urgency.  My Department is also examining the potential implications of these events for the PPP housing programme generally and a specialist group has been established to further this aim.  My main concern at this stage is to reassure the communities directly involved that the regeneration process continues.  Dublin City Council remains firmly committed to this objective and my Department will continue to engage actively with the council as it endeavours to move the process forward as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">Since the news reached the communities in Dublin where the five regeneration projects were to take place, there has been a great deal of concern and anger at the delay in bringing them to fruition.  The PPP process was deemed to be the solution to the problems related to acquiring the necessary capital for, and to giving impetus to, these housing projects.  After waiting eight years for them to proceed, does the Minister of State accept the urgency regarding this matter has reached a level where the patience of the residents, who are the most important consideration in the entire debacle, is being called into question?  Will he apply himself fully to ensuring Michael McNamara and Company, the successful bidder for these projects, and his Department engage with the communities to make sure they are reassured about the potential for many new and regenerated homes in their areas?</p>

            <p eId="para_122">The national development plan had significant targets in respect of social and affordable housing.  The PPP process was part and parcel of the strategy to deliver those targets.  With the rapid reduction in the number of house completions and the forecast for house completions in the next couple of years, can the Minister of State tell us what the revised social and affordable housing targets for the next couple of years are arising from the massive downtown in house completions we have seen this year and which is forecast for next year and the year after?</p>

As the Deputy is aware, the report from the different local authorities is due to be returned to my Department inside the next couple of weeks.  There are 17 live PPP projects across the country, most of which are in Dublin.  They will offer 1,427 social housing units, 2,131 affordable housing units and 4,105 private units so there is still a major housing development programme in place.  As I said, Dublin City Council alone has been allocated a sum of €250 million towards its housing needs for 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_128">As I have previously indicated to the House, I am at present considering the next steps to be taken in respect of the electronic voting project.  In all of this, I am taking into account the work of the commission on electronic voting which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally and the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">I am not in a position, therefore, to be definitive regarding the timing of future use of the system.  I am conscious of the extensive work inherent in the recommendations of the commission on electronic voting, including the replacement of the election management software, as well as adaptations to the equipment and further end-to-end testing.  At the very least, it will be problematic to envisage use of the current e-voting scheme at the local and European elections in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The total cost incurred to date in the development and roll-out of the electronic voting and counting system is €51.3 million, including some €2.6 million in respect of awareness and education initiatives.  In addition, information provided by returning officers to my Department indicates that the total annual storage costs incurred by them in respect of the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment in 2007 is some €489,000, with figures for 2004, 2005 and 2006 amounting to some €658,000, €696,000, and €706,000, respectively.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement of the electronic voting equipment to centralised storage arrangements are some €328,000.  Further costs will be incurred in respect of the completion of these arrangements, including buy-out costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">The pertinent part of the question asked whether electronic voting will be used in next year's local elections.  Judging by the Minister's response this afternoon, the answer is "No".  His response mentions the commission's 2006 report which contained a number of recommendations and very clear points.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">Electronic voting was set up to improve the efficiency of the electoral administration, create minimum maintenance for the pre-election, election and post-election periods and support the positive image in the country of the use of electronic information.  On those three fronts, electronic voting has clearly failed.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">Has the Minister signed up to this project or not?  It has been two years since the commission brought its report before the House and its recommendations are quite clear.  If the Minister is not sure about this, I call tell him that last week the Dutch Government, which used the same electronic voting system as us, found that the system it purchased is so faulty that it has now scrapped it and reverted to a pen and paper system.  This is the same system which is costing us €500,000 per year, at a subsidised rate I might add.  We got the rate reduced to €500,000 per year to store annually.  The sum is now approaching almost €16 million in total expenditure to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">It is unbelievable that the Minister can say that he is looking at it when a report has been on the desk of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government since 2006.  I accept that the report has been on the current Minister's desk since last autumn.  Will the Minister clarify whether he is seriously looking at the use of these machines for the local elections next year or is he saying that there will be further examination of this matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_137">Let us be very clear on this issue.  Due to my involvement in very close election counts over the years, I have advocated the use of electronic voting.  The most important thing is that we have public confidence in the system.  The Deputy rightly points out that there have been reports from the Dutch Government.  It recently issued a statement that it is currently not possible to guarantee that a newly developed electronic voting system would be secure from the emission of radio signals within the stringent threshold set and, therefore, decided to abandon all plans to use electronic voting systems at this time.  The statement also refers to the significant investment that would be required to produce the new proposed electronic voting system, which the Dutch Cabinet has decided would add little value compared to voting with pencil and paper.  The Dutch electorate will vote using pencil and paper in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">However, the Deputy needs to be aware that the Nedap voting machines, which are the machines about which we are talking, have recently been recertified in Germany, with the Federal Interior Ministry concluding that the Nedap machines correspond fully with the requirements of German democratic elections.  A statement from that Minister late last year found that the recommendations of the Dutch committee to no longer use the Nedap machines was not based on technical uncertainty and were not transferable to Germany.  Parliamentary elections in Hessen went ahead with the use of the reapproved Nedap machines on 27 January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">I am weighing up all these issues and the very latest data.  I have a predisposition to caution but will weigh up all the options.  If I find that the cost is prohibitive and, in particular, that we cannot get public confidence in the system, I will have to look at that very carefully and make a decision on that basis.  That is the situation.  I hope that when I reach a definitive decision, the Deputy will pat me on the back for doing so.</p>

         if he is confident that the policies of the Government and its agencies will achieve the targets set down in the water framework directive when considering the standard of septic tanks in use here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_145">The water framework directive requires member states to achieve at least good status of waters by 2015 and to prevent the deterioration of the status of all bodies of water, including rivers, lakes, ground water, estuaries and coastal waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">These objectives will be achieved through river basin management plans which are required to be prepared under the directive.  Draft river basin management plans are due to be published in 2008 and adopted by the end of 2009.  Each plan will be accompanied by a programme of measures aimed at achieving the environmental objectives set out in the directive.  The objectives of the directive relate to the protection of ground water and require specific measures to be taken to prevent or limit the input of pollutants to ground water.  The programme of measures must be made operational by 2012 at the latest, with the aim of achieving the environmental objectives by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Where measures already taken have not fully met the objectives of the water framework directive, or fall short of achieving the good status objective for waters by 2015, additional measures will need to be developed at river basin management level.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The regulations which transpose the water framework directive into national law assign the responsibility of making river basin management plans to the constituent local authorities of each of the river basin districts.  This work is led by a co-ordinating local authority in each river basin district.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">My Department will shortly issue guidance on the preparation of river basin management plans.  The guidance will, <i>inter alia</i>, set out the steps that must be taken by public authorities involved in the river basin management planning to align the objectives of other plans and programmes, for example, regional planning guidelines, county development plans and so forth, with the objectives and goals of the water framework directive and to promote the co-ordinated implementation of the directive across river basin districts.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">With regard to septic tanks, the EPA is currently finalising a revised edition of its code of practice on waste water treatment systems serving single homes.  This will refer to the most up-to-date European standards and I understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland will replace its existing 1991 standard applying to septic tanks with the EPA code.  More generally, since the adoption of the water framework directive, successive water services investment programmes have taken account of its requirements in the prioritisation of schemes to protect and improve water quality and this emphasis will be maintained in future years.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_152">Does the Minister accept that malfunctioning septic tanks, whether operated by local authorities or individuals, and current waste water treatment systems do nothing to enhance Ireland's reputation or improve our chances of meeting the objectives of the directive?  There is no chance of meeting the objectives on the basis of current measures, in line with what is required by 2015.  What additional measures is the Minister considering to achieve the objectives?  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has never specified or required a minimum level of quality for treated effluent or durability to be achieved, either by septic tanks or other means.  Does the Minister accept that and what will he do about it?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_153">I do not accept that.  The existing standards for septic tanks are set out in the recommendations for domestic effluent treatment and disposal from single dwelling houses, published in 1991 by the NSAI.  These standards are incorporated into Part H of the building regulations dealing with drainage and waste water disposal.  The aim of these standards is to achieve satisfactory practice in the design, construction and maintenance of septic tank drainage systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The EPA is currently developing a code of practice for waste water treatment systems for single houses.  This will incorporate the requirements of new European standards, due to come into force on 1 July 2009.  My Department has placed local authorities on notice about the pending application of the European standards.  Two circular letters have issued, which include recommended performance levels for treatment systems which have been determined by the Irish Agrément Board, the national and European-recognised body for certifying new building products or systems, for which national standards do not exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">I intend that the EPA code of practice will replace the NSAI standard of 1991, under the building regulations.  As soon as the EPA completes its work, in the coming months, I will incorporate the code of practice and replace the standard recommendations of 1991 under Part H of the building regulations dealing with drainage and waste water disposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">I do not fully understand the Deputy's question.  On the one hand, he is saying that there is no standard and on the other, that there is a standard, but it dates back to 1991.  That is the standard, the NSAI standard.  I have just informed the House that there is an EPA standard. I have also informed the House that I have issued letters to the local authorities on the matter.  We are taking account of the directive and are implementing higher standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The Deputy knows that local authorities have the power to issue by-laws in this area.  Only one has done so to date, namely Cavan County Council, mainly because of the topographic situation in that county.  We are working on the matter and the Deputy is right to identify the septic tank as a major issue in the context of water quality.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         if he has been in contact with the Department of Finance or the Commission on Taxation regarding the introduction of a carbon tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_166">The terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation require it to "investigate fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment including the introduction of a carbon tax".  They also provide that "as the introduction of a carbon tax requires a completely new tax charge and structure, the commission is asked to commence work in this area immediately".  These terms of reference directly reflect the commitment in the programme for Government to investigate fiscal measures to protect and enhance the environment, including the introduction of a carbon tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">At the invitation of the commission, my Department has made a submission on the wide range of issues encompassed in the commission's brief.  On the issue of carbon tax, the submission sets out the background to the previous consideration of the measure and points out that the case for the tax is now more compelling and more urgent than ever, in the context of our Kyoto Protocol targets and the need for much greater reductions in emissions in the post-Kyoto period.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The submission also advocates looking beyond minimum compliance targets, no matter how stringent.  The more fundamental issue is the need for an early and effective transition to a low-carbon society, which has the potential to deliver significant environmental and economic benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_169">The submission also draws attention to the recent ESRI medium-term review, which factors a carbon levy into its economic modelling for the period up to 2015.  This analysis assumes that a carbon tax will be introduced in 2010 at the market price of carbon and that the resulting revenue will be used to keep labour taxes lower than they would otherwise be.  The analysis shows that the economic impact is positive — the competitiveness of the Irish economy is increased, with higher employment and economic growth than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_180">Responsibility for the elaboration of standards and for the certification of products rests with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  When the issue of pyrite arose, and following an intervention by my Department, the NSAI reconvened its aggregates panel to give urgent consideration to the publication of additional guidance on appropriate protocols for testing under-floor infill material.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">The NSAI published a new standard recommendation which is a definitive amendment to an existing standard recommendation of 2004 on aggregates.  This standard recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and the intention is that it will address the quality standards of new homes in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">The national building regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and for extensions and material alterations to existing buildings.  The related technical guidance documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with the regulations.  In the case of pyrite, the relevant regulations are part C dealing with site preparation and resistance to moisture and part D dealing with materials and workmanship.  I have set a process in train to incorporate further guidance on the new NSAI standard in technical guidance document C.  I am awaiting the conclusion of a mandatory three-month consultation period with the European Commissioner and the Commission under Internal Market rules before its formal adoption.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">The issue of pyrite in homes is a major one that has been raised with me as a representative of constituents on the north side of Dublin.  Hundreds if not thousands of homes are affected and with the delay in testing by some builders and HomeBond, it is difficult to put a figure on the number of homes directly affected.  The Minister has ignored this issue during the past year.  He does not want to get directly involved, but he must intervene because hundreds if not thousands of young home owners are directly affected.  Some of them cannot sell their homes due to negative equity.  Furthermore, they cannot live in their homes.  The Minister must take direct responsibility for this issue.  Hopefully, now that we have a new Minister of State with responsibility for housing, he will have a fresh perspective on this issue and will be able to give a commitment to reconsider it.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">What new measures will the Minister put in place in terms of the building regulations to ensure that an issue such as this one will never happen again, that there no longer will be self-regulation of building standards and that regulation and certification will be undertaken by local authorities?</p>

            <p eId="para_187">Since 1 March last I have commenced new enforcement powers under the Building Control Act 2007.  In summary, these powers will significantly increase the maximum penalties for breaches of the national building regulations.  For example, the old fine of IR£10,000 has been increased to €50,000 on conviction or indictment.  We will introduce the option for authorities to bring summary prosecution for all building code offences in the District Court, thus simplifying the prosecution process.  We will provide a new income stream for the building control authorities by retaining any fines income for their activities and recouping expenses incurred in the prosecution process.  We will widen the right of the building control authorities to seek an order from the High Court or the Circuit Court to stop work on buildings where there is non-compliance with the building code.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">If the Deputy is asking what has been done about the use of this contaminated material, the local building control authority for the area in question, Fingal County Council, contacted the builders and the quarry concerned directly to ascertain the full extent of the problem and to ensure that there is no further use of this material for house building.  That is the position.  It is clear from that contact that we are acting on this matter.  It is an important issue and the Department is doing everything it can to ensure that this will never happen again.</p>

That is fine and good and we very much welcome the new regulations in this area, but what about the position of people affected on the north side of Dublin?  These new standards will not help them.

We must ensure that practice does not happen again, but ultimately these are matters for the individuals and the builders in question.  That is the position.  As a Government, we must regulate the activities of these individuals to ensure this matter will not arise again.  That is the role of the State in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_195">I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 121, 125 and 130 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">My Department has prepared a screening regulatory impact analysis on the options for transposing the EU environmental liability directive.  This document is available on my Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie.</i>  The views of interested parties were sought on it, and 29 responses were received from a varied group of respondents.  These views have now been assessed.  A summary of the views submitted will be published as part of the further consultation on the transposition of the directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">Preparatory work on drafting the legal instrument for transposing the directive is under way in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  I will publish the draft instrument for public consultation as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">My Department has received, from the European Commission, a letter of formal notice and a reasoned opinion under Article 226 of the EU treaty about the transposition of the environmental liability directive.  Responses to this correspondence issued to the Commission on 26 July 2007 and 31 March 2008, respectively.  There has been no further correspondence from the Commission.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_83">
            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_199">I thank the Minister for his reply and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, on his appointment.  The questions I put to the Minister relate to the need to transpose the environmental liability directive into Irish law.  I have asked about this previously, most recently in December.  At that stage, the Minister said he was preparing the screening referred to, that it was on his website, he was awaiting replies and preparatory work was already being done on the draft legislation.  He has said more or less the same in his reply today, but has added that he has received 29 responses, will have further consultation and will then publish draft legislation as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">We had three years from 2004 to transpose this legislation.  The deadline for transposition was April 2007.  A year ago we received a formal notice or first warning from the European Commission for not having met the deadline and transposed the law.  The Minister responded to that notice on 26 July and this year received a reasoned opinion from the Commission, basically a preliminary to the Commission referring us to the European Court of Justice for our failure to transpose the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">It is now almost four years since the directive was put in place.  We missed the three-year deadline and now another year has passed.  The Minister has been a year in the job and no progress has been made.  If he was not in Government, this is the sort of delay the Minister would have said was a black mark against Ireland.  The issue should be treated as urgent.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">Why do we need this directive implemented?  For example, if we had an oil spill off the coast — we have 1,600 km of coastline — like the one that occurred off the coast of France in 1999 when the ship <i>Erica</i> sank resulting in catastrophic damage to 400 km of the French coast and causing the death of tens of thousands of birds, we would have nothing in law to ensure the protection of our environment or to ensure that those responsible would be held legally and financially accountable.  We need the directive implemented in order to deter operators of ships, incinerators and other facilities from causing damage to the environment.  If it were implemented, they would know they would be held legally and financially accountable.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">Why does the Minister not give more priority to this sort of issue?  He is a Green Party Minister and the directive is about protecting the environment.  The Minister could make his mark with this.  He could put on the Statute Book something that would be there for good and protect the environment.  However, he is just doing fiddly little things on climate change awareness and similar issues.  Transposing the directive would be a concrete and significant move for the Minister.  If he does not do it, he leaves us vulnerable as our environment may not be properly protected.  What will he do about the situation?</p>

            <p eId="para_204">Speaking about fiddly little moves, I noticed the Deputy had an interesting press release yesterday on the issue of clothes lines.  The directive will be transposed by a combination of primary and secondary legislation.  The timescale is dependent on the drafting and passage of the legislation, but I intend it will be completed before the end of 2008.  As I said earlier, we will see what the Deputy has to say when it is completed.  I wonder whether she will be complimentary then or whether she will find some other reason to criticise us, which I suspect will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">It is interesting that neither Deputy Tuffy nor Deputy Wall, who also submitted a question on this issue, made any submission on the regulatory impact analysis.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_207">The Deputy seems to have misunderstood the situation relating to the directive.  She gave an example of an oil spill from a ship.  The environmental liability directive, ELD, precludes its application to environmental damage or to an imminent threat of such damage arising from an incident in respect of which liability or compensation falls within the scope of a number of conventions which are in force in the member states concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">Let me give a specific example.  For Ireland, this includes the International Convention of 27 November 1992 on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and the International Convention of 27 November 1992 on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage.  Where the damage to the environment is not covered by these conventions and is assessed by the competent authority as environmental damage within the meaning of the ELD, the operator of the ship concerned will be subject to the liability provisions of the ELD.  Therefore, the scenario outlined by the Deputy is already covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">It should be noted that under the ELD, water damage only concerns specific waters, including the territorial seas, which extend approximately 12 nautical miles out from the coast, while damage to protected species and natural habitats under the ELD extends to the exclusive economic zones, the 200 mile exclusive fishery limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">The issues referred to by the Deputy are already covered.  We are undertaking a thorough process to deal with the directive.  We will complete the legislation and it will be a combination of both primary and secondary legislation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_87">
            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_211">The directive was spurred on by the sinking of the <i>Erica,</i> which is why I gave it as an example.  There are obviously specifics in the directive about exemptions and defences.  If there was an oil spill or damage was caused to our coast or our waters or if our land was contaminated or operators of facilities with an IPCC licence damaged the environment, the legislation would mean they could be held financially responsible for the damage.  Therefore, the Government could recover the costs, if for example there was a threat to wildlife.  The Government launched a report a few weeks ago about the threats to many species in protected areas.  What if environmental damage was caused to habitats in protected areas?  The legislation needs to be in place to ensure the safety of such habitats.  It can help prevent damage by acting as an incentive not to cause damage, but if necessary it can help to recover costs and hold those who cause the damage to account.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">The Minister said he hopes to have the legislation in place by end-2008.  While long overdue, it will be welcome then.  The Minister has been in office a year and has not got it done yet.  As far as I know, it is not on the Bills list, although it should be if it is to be introduced in 2008.  I do not understand why the Government must have so many consultations about straightforward legislation.  The consultation on this legislation has already been done.  We have had the three years plus another year for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_213">This is a European directive which must be transposed into Irish law, which should not be difficult to do.  We do not need loads of consultations and submissions.  The Labour Party does not see the need for all of that.  That is playing for time.  The Minister needs to get the legislation in place now.  When exactly in 2008 will he do that?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_88" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_214">The delay in the transposition has been due to the complexities of the directive and its interface with existing national environmental legislation.  As the Deputy may know, 15 other member states, including the United Kingdom, are in a similar position to Ireland in not having transposed the ELD.  I intend to do so and have spoken to the Commissioner on the issue.  I have assured the Commissioner that it is my intention and top priority to ensure EU environmental directives are transposed.  That and the question of infringements are most important.  The Deputy is correct that I published a report on the habitats directive.  It was a warts-and-all report which spelled out in much detail that there is some way to go in the protection of some sensitive species such as the freshwater pearl mussel which is on the brink of extinction.  I outlined in detail the steps I am taking to ensure this does not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">While the Deputy claims we have been in government for 11 months but have not yet transposed any directives, we have given extra funding, an increase of 42%, to the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Parks and Wildlife Service so they have the means of protecting our habitats and species.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_216">This is one of three directives, according to the Minister's reply, that is outstanding for transposition into environmental law.  It is one of 29 infringements about which the Commission has been in contact with the Department.  There is a strong possibility that Ireland may be referred to the European Court of Justice this year and fined if the legislation is not given priority.  When does the Minister expect to hear from the Commission on this matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_217">So far no steps have been taken to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice.  Next week, I will meet the Commissioner for the Environment, Stavros Dimas, in Luxembourg.  We have met frequently to discuss this issue.  On taking office I made it clear that my first priority was to meet the Commissioner to assure him that this Minister puts the transposition of EU directives at the top of his agenda.  Without that legislation coming from Europe, this country would not have the environment it has.  We are dependent on it and it is one more reason people should vote "Yes" to the Lisbon treaty.</p>

            <p eId="para_224">I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 108, 119, 140 and 456 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the legal requirements for planning authorities for the taking in charge of residential estates where certain conditions have been met.  Updated policy guidance on this matter in the form of circular letter PD 1/08 was issued to all planning authorities by my Department in February 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">Facilities required to be taken in charge are set out in the policy guidance.  They include public roads and footpaths, unallocated surface parking areas, public lighting, public water supply, foul and storm water drainage and public open spaces.  The guidance also sets out the limited circumstances in which planning authorities should attach conditions to planning permissions for management companies or other management arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">Each planning authority was asked to develop or update, as appropriate, its policy on taking in charge by the end of June 2008 on the basis of the updated policy guidance, and to ensure its revised policy be made available to the public, published on its website and continue to be reported on to the elected members on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">The new service indicator for the taking in charge of estates will provide benchmark data from 2009 onwards for monitoring the taking in charge process and, in particular, the priority being accorded by individual planning authorities to the taking in charge of unfinished or legacy estates.  The information to be reported will include the number of estates taken in charge in the year in question, the total number of dwellings in these estates and the number of estates in respect of which enforcement action was taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">Since I was elected, I have noted the Minister invites ideas from across the floor of the House.  May I suggest regarding the nuclear test ban Bill that he removes the provision that allows only for imprisonment for 12 months or a fine of €5,000 for the detonation of a nuclear device in Ireland?</p>
            <p eId="para_230">Will the Department record the information from the local authorities when it is collected by the end of June?  How many local authorities have complied with the guidance requirements to date? The recently issued circular from the Minister states what local authorities should have been doing already.  There are few new requirements in it with no major breakthrough in the planning area.  Ultimately, it is a matter of enforcement.  Should the circular allow local authorities to carry out enforcement to ensure developments can be taken in charge?  Often local authorities find when taking in charge of an estate that the developer is broke or no longer in business.  Should we ensure the costs for taking in charge are kept to a minimum rather than local authorities having to make up the shortfall to get estates to standard and taken in charge?</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_231">The developer of a residential estate is statutorily required to complete the development in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.  A development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is an unauthorised development. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice on a development requiring such steps as it may specific to be taken within a specified period.  A planning authority may also apply to the High Court or the Circuit Court for an order requiring any person to do or not do anything that the court considers necessary to ensure the development is carried out in conformity with the planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">I want to strengthen the enforcement powers available to planning authorities.  The section 35 amendment introduced in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 allows a planning authority to refuse planning permission without recourse to the High Court to a developer who is in substantial non-compliance with the terms of a previous permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">The implementation of the new policy in this area will require the commitment of additional resources by planning authorities, particularly with pre-application consultations and the inspection of construction.  There may also be a cost for additional remedial works that may be required before older estates can be taken in charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">Record levels of general purposes grants have been provided this year for local authorities from the local government fund, amounting to approximately €1 billion.  I am confident the level of funding made available is adequate to meet ongoing local authority needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">The Department has also completed a review of planning application fees which the local authorities requested.  These were last increased in 1998.  A public consultation process on the matter has been completed and I am expecting a report on the outcome of that consultation presently.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">Speaking on this topic a month ago I put two questions to the Minister concerning the number of local authorities that have compiled this information.  When the deadline of 28 June as detailed in the circular arrives, will local authorities be required to report to the Department that they have drawn up the guidelines as set out in the circular?  Is it the case that these guidelines from the Department do not add anything further to what is being enforced or is in place under legislation?  Local authorities have plenty of guidelines and circulars; the difficulty is with enforcement.</p>

As I stated in my previous reply, I am of the view that they have the necessary resources.  The Department is issuing circular letters to the local authorities to say that this is important work which must be done.  It is not just a question of allowing them to issue guidelines; this matter is very important and the Department will be following it up.

I know the Minister is taking this matter seriously but he is up against developers and the local authorities.  I know from replies received to parliamentary questions in 2006 and 2007 that in the past circulars were sent to local authorities.  How many local authorities replied to those circulars?  What happens in the case of an estate where one side is left undeveloped so the estate is not complete?  A builder may have built 300 or 400 houses, a management company is set up and one side of the estate is left vacant.  What happens in that case?  Has the local authority any authority to take over that estate or must the management company continue despite the efforts of the householders?</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_241">I appreciate the Minister's response with regard to the circular setting out what local authorities should and should not take in charge.  The key issue concerns timeframes and bonds.  The problem concerns the situations where estates are not being taken in charge for between seven and 13 years.  The solution is quite simple.  Guidelines should set out much higher bonds which developers must pay, bonds which are worth losing.  If an estate is not completed to the satisfaction of the local authority after, for example, an interval of five years, the developer would lose the entirety of that bond.  This must be a bond worth losing because currently it is only about €10,000 or €11,000.  If it is a bond worth losing then the local authority could use that money to finish the job.  This is the key reform that needs to be put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_247">New service indicators are now in place.  Planning authorities will be asked each year to provide the following information in respect of the previous year — the number of residential estates for which the planning permission has expired in respect of which formal written requests for taking in charge were made either by residents or developers; the number of estates taken in charge in the year in question; the total number of dwellings in these estates; the number of estates not completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in line with the planning permission, in respect of which requests were received; the number of such estates in respect of which enforcement action was taken in the year in question and-or whether the bond was called in; and the number of such estates in respect of which works were undertaken by the authority to bring the estate to a taking in charge standard.  Those are the main elements of the new service indicators and they will definitely have an effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_248">I take on board the comments made by Deputy Varadkar about bonds.  Deputies have asked about direction.  The main elements of the policy guidance will be incorporated into the new sustainable residential development guidelines which are currently available for public consultation.  They will be issued later this year under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Planning authorities are obliged to have regard to such guidelines in the exercise of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_249">The question posed by Deputy Barrett is also important.  The preservation of green space must be a priority.  One of the things I noticed on taking office is that we do not have either a landscape or a parks policy.  I would regard such policies as being essential components to enhancing people's quality of life or to preserving existing quality of life which would deteriorate if there was a shortage of green space.  I know that in the case of green space which is supposed to be protected, this can be gradually eroded.  The Deputy's point is valid and I will make this a priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">The single biggest decision made by the Irish people will be made on 12 June in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the Lisbon treaty has the full support of the Fine Gael Party since it was first agreed and even before it was signed in December.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_255">The Taoiseach will be aware that from the outset I have openly advised the public and the supporters of this party to set aside any differences with the Government on this issue and to campaign strongly and vote for the treaty.  It is my firm belief that this country's future lies in being at the heart of a coherent, strong and effective Europe which will equip our people to deal politically and in every other way with the challenges that lie ahead.  The recent opinion polls have highlighted the difficulty of those of us campaigning for a "Yes" vote in getting across the message to the people so that they are fully and properly informed when they make their decision on 12 June.  From that perspective it is very necessary that all the parties supporting the Lisbon treaty would co-operate fully in the endeavour of informing people as fully as possible so that they can make their minds up on 12 June.  In that regard I will continue to put the country first and will continue to campaign vigorously right through to the end of this campaign for a "Yes" vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">This is not a comment which the Taoiseach should take personally but I was disappointed at the tenor and import of his remarks at the weekend in regard to both Fine Gael and the Labour Party — for whom I do not speak on this matter — about the effort that good people all over the country are putting into the campaign.  People who are supporting the "Yes" campaign but are not supporters of Fianna Fáil have felt the antagonism.  It is necessary that the Taoiseach clarifies this matter.  I ask him to withdraw that remark and to say he encourages everybody who is supporting the "Yes" campaign to continue to do so.  We do need co-operation among those supporting the "Yes" campaign to have everybody properly informed about what is in this treaty and how it can equip Europe to meet the challenges that lie ahead.  From that perspective, the Taoiseach's remarks at the weekend, as reported, have caused a great deal of antagonism and difficulty for people supporting the "Yes" campaign who are not supporters of Fianna Fáil.  In the interests of harmony and running a cohesive "Yes" campaign by all parties that support the treaty, I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw those remarks and clear this matter up.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">I am simply making the point that an opinion poll is a snapshot of opinion.  I was glad to see we were ahead in the poll.  I have said on numerous occasions this is not a party political matter.  I was asked a question and simply said we were all going to work hard over the coming two and a half weeks to ensure we get the result in the national interest.  Any interpretation to the contrary does not take into account the import of what I had to say.  I have plenty of reasons to have rows with Deputy Kenny on a range of issues, but I have no issue with him on this matter and never had.  Rather than trying to find offence where none is intended, and none was actually offered, we should just get on with the campaign and proceed.  That is the point and any interpretation to the contrary is mistaken.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I am not looking for anything out of this.  My focus is on having the treaty endorsed by the Irish people and passed by them with a resounding "Yes" vote.  In order to do that they will have to be properly and fully informed, but they must also be enthusiastic about wanting to come out to vote.  The Taoiseach's remarks, as reported, were to the effect that his party is the most pro-European in the campaign and that other parties, including Fine Gael and Labour, should crank up their campaigns to the level of the Fianna Fáil one.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Minister for Finance said that if Fine Gael exercised dictatorial control over its members the Lisbon treaty might be passed.  It is perfectly obvious to all and sundry, however, that this party was first out of the traps with its campaign, including posters and public meetings.  The fact is that the Taoiseach's remarks have caused a deal of antagonism across the country.  I am telling him this face to face.  It makes my job more difficult and from that perspective I think he should withdraw those remarks, as reported.  That would be in everybody's interest.  The Taoiseach has admitted he has not read the treaty.  The Tánaiste had her difficulties with the commissioners.</p>

In the interests of everybody working in co-operation and harmony to see that there is a "Yes" vote, we need co-operation among the parties that are campaigning for a "Yes" vote.  I ask the Taoiseach again to withdraw that remark and clear the air.  He should not antagonise or insult members of the public or parties that are campaigning for a "Yes" vote but who are not members of Fianna Fáil.  It is in the Taoiseach's interest and that of the country for him to do so.  If the Taoiseach takes this occasion, two week's before the people are asked to decide, to deal with this matter he will not hear me mention it again.  He now has an opportunity to respond and I hope he will do so positively in the spirit in which I have made this contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">There are occasions when, in the country's interest, the Taoiseach will have to resist the temptation to give the Opposition parties a kick every time he sees us.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the prices issue I raised last week.  I was glad that after I raised the issue here last Wednesday, the Taoiseach asked the Tánaiste to get a handle on the problem.  Following that, I understand the Tánaiste had discussions with the National Consumer Agency.  I see from a radio interview given by the chief executive of that agency on Friday, that the NCA will conduct a survey of prices in retail outlets.  However, a bit more than a survey is required to deal with the prices problem I raised last week.  I ask the Taoiseach to address a number of ways in which this problem can be tackled.  First, if the National Consumer Agency is doing a survey, can the Taoiseach ensure it will list retail outlets that are ripping off Irish consumers?  For example, retail branches of British multiples that have one price in the UK and another price here should be named and shamed in the survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Second, will the Taoiseach ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce regulations to allow people to pay by credit card in sterling for goods that are marked in sterling prices?  In other words, if goods are priced in sterling, people should be able to pay for them by credit card in sterling.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Third, will the Taoiseach ask the Tánaiste to introduce regulations, which she is entitled to do, under section 50 of the Consumer Protection Act for the labelling of goods, so that where prices are marked in sterling and in euro, the euro equivalent of sterling at a particular date is given?  I appreciate this cannot be done every day because of varying exchange rates.  However, one should be able to display the sterling price with the euro equivalent on whatever date.  If a separate euro price is charged it should also be marked.  In that way, consumers can see the extent to which they are being ripped off.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Fourth, will the Taoiseach call in the senior management of the large British multiples and tell them in his own blunt language what is required of them in this country, and that the ripping off of Irish consumers will not be tolerated?</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Fifth, will the Taoiseach ask the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to examine what is happening with regard to diesel prices, which I also raised last Wednesday?  They have shot ahead of petrol prices, even though they have traditionally been lower.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_136">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_288">This matter has been discussed by the Government.  Arising from that meeting it has been decided that the National Consumer Agency will again meet Retail Ireland, which is part of IBEC, in the near future to discuss the delays in passing on the benefits accruing from the appreciation of the euro.  The Tánaiste will be talking to Retail Ireland in the morning.  We have also arranged for contact to be made with the major retail outlets, both here and in the UK, in the coming days to ask what plans they may have to deal with any unjustified price differentials that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The National Consumer Agency will undertake a greater number of surveys with particular emphasis on North-South pricing by big retailers across a whole range of goods from groceries to clothing.  In addition, the National Consumer Agency will undertake a more extensive information campaign to keep consumers better informed on pricing developments.  The advice from them that consumers split their grocery shopping basket if possible and seek value in the range of shops available to them remains valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The increase in the price of diesel seems to be linked to a huge demand in China.  The price of diesel does not come under the auspices of the National Consumer Agency.  It is a question of trying to do what we can in that respect.  There is a background to the increase in oil prices that sets out that situation.  The Government will do absolutely everything it can to ensure that public awareness is at its highest and that people are aware of the situation.  Whatever assistance we can give, including, if possible, accommodating some of the suggestions made by the Deputy, will be given.  The Tánaiste will contact, through meetings of the National Consumer Agency, Retail Ireland.  She will write to the heads of the retail outlets in Ireland and in Britain to ascertain what plans they have to deal with the situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_291">I am pleased to hear some action is being taken to deal with this problem but it will require more than just pleading with the British retailers concerned and it will take more than meetings between the National Consumer Agency and Retail Ireland.  The Government needs to show that, if necessary, it will flex its muscles on this issue.  This has gone on for quite a while.  The change in the relationship between the euro and sterling has been in play for some time and the value has not been passed on to the Irish consumer.  With each passing day, consumers are continuing to be ripped off.  I appreciate that attention is being given to the matter arising from the question I raised last Wednesday, but the full powers of the Consumer Protection Act need to be used by the Minister.  There are powers in that Act which provide for regulations to be made by the Minister in regard to labelling which, I understand, would include price labelling.  If necessary, additional regulatory and legislative measures should be introduced to force retailers to adopt practices that are not ripping off Irish consumers.  I am glad that some attention is being given to this matter.  I ask the Minister to look to the powers available to her under the Consumer Protection Act and to the possibility of strengthening those powers, if necessary.</p>

I have indicated that whatever action can be taken by Government will be taken.  The Tánaiste will arrange for correspondence to issue to the organisations concerned which will set out clearly what we expect and what we believe should be possible.  We will look at the situation in terms of the reply we receive.  If the reply is not what I expect, the Government will look at every lever available to it to ensure consumers are protected in this jurisdiction and that they get the same value for money as people can expect elsewhere.</p>

This differs from the manner in which statements are ordered in the House where Sinn Féin has the opportunity to participate.  My party's dependence on an extension of time to have an opportunity to make a contribution on this important issue is a direct result of the acceptance of the Private Notice Question.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and Chief Whip to allow for additional time to guarantee the participation of all opinion represented in the House on this very important issue.  I am disappointed the other allied issue of the proposed co-location of the Central Mental Hospital is not part of what the House will address.  I would like to reflect on that.  My appeal is that there should be an extension of time to allow for all opinion to participate.

In the previous Dáil the Labour Party, through Deputy Howlin, introduced a Bill to provide for civil unions or civil partnerships.  The Bill was deemed to have passed Second Stage but the six month run on it elapsed during the general election period.  A motion tabled by my party in the House last October to have the Bill referred to committee was voted down by the Government with the promise that it would have the heads of its own Bill published by the end of March.  While I am fairly reasonable and do not mind if things run on a couple of weeks, I note from reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning that there are differences in Government over this Bill and it may be delayed.  Are there differences between the Government parties about bringing a civil partnership or civil unions Bill before the House?  Where stands the commitment, given to the House when the Labour Party brought its Bill to the House, that the heads of the Government’s Bill would be published by the end of March?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_236">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_402">I propose to take all the questions together.</p>
            <p eId="para_403">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I am sure that they condemn this unofficial action that has brought such disruption to train services.  The day-to-day operation of train services, including the management of industrial relations, is a matter for Irish Rail.</p>
            <p eId="para_404">This industrial action, which has brought almost 20 daily train services in Cork and Kerry to a halt, including commuter services in the Cork city area, has its origins in the refusal by some drivers to undertake in full driving duties that had been agreed with the NBRU and SIPTU national drivers committee and endorsed by the Labour Relations Commission last March.  The dispute is affecting thousands of passengers, many of whom are not well placed to organise alternative means of transport.  These people are being seriously inconvenienced by this unofficial action, which should cease immediately as far as I am concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_405">Apart from directly impacting on Irish Rail revenue, the unofficial action is also undoing some of the good work carried out by Irish Rail in recent years to improve the quantity and quality of services.  There has been sustained high-level capital and current investment in the rail network over the past decade.  This year, a total of €522 million in capital funding and €191 million in current funding has been allocated to Irish Rail, which represents an 18% increase on the 2007 figure.  That is a substantial level of Exchequer investment in the railway network.  It is being used to fund major infrastructure and rolling stock upgrades.  The beneficial impact of this Government investment is evident in the increased passenger numbers being carried by Irish Rail, which are up from 31.7 million passengers in 2000 to almost 47 million passengers in 2007, representing a 50% increase.  There are now more trains and more services carrying more people than ever.  This customer base, growing in response to the improved services, rightly expects a reliable service that is not subject to regular disruption.  If it is to retain and expand its customer base and effectively make the case for ongoing investment in the rail network, Irish Rail must be able to guarantee reliability.</p>
            <p eId="para_406">Regarding  "no strike" clauses, Iarnród Éireann has agreements in place to limit industrial action and its impact on services.  The Labour Relations Commission code of practice advocates procedures and safeguards in the case of essential services, namely, those whose cessation or interruption could endanger life, cause major damage to the national economy or widespread hardship to the community.  The Labour Relations Commission recommends that parties should recognise the joint responsibility to resolve disputes without resorting to strikes or other forms of industrial action.</p>
            <p eId="para_407">Unofficial industrial action hinders the promotion of public transport as a viable alternative and there is a case to be made that "no strike" clauses would improve confidence in public transport and ensure the efficient operation of public transport network services.  It would not be appropriate for me to intervene and I do not intend to do so.  I regret the inconvenience caused to customers and ask that the unofficial action be withdrawn immediately.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_237">
            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_408">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing the private notice question.  I was caught in this last Thursday when the dispute broke, as were thousands of others.  The Minister referred to the fact that this has been going on for quite some time.  Is there no early warning system in the industrial relations machinery of the State that should have picked this up and averted it a long time ago?  I welcome the fact that the Labour Relations Commission is meeting both sides today.  I wish it well and hope that it resolves the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_409">Does the Minister agree there is something fundamentally wrong with the relations between some workers and management in Iarnród Éireann to lead to this?  It seems to be intractable and bitter.  It needs some form of investigation to find out what has led to this and to ensure it does not happen again.</p>
            <p eId="para_410">Does the Minister agree that the important matter is to get the trains on track so that the public is not inconvenienced any further?  Many thousands of people in Cork have been seriously discommoded over the past while.  Will the Minister join with me in calling on both sides to get the trains on track now, to work to sort out whatever residual difficulties exist and to use all the mechanisms of the State to ensure this deep and bitter issue, which has been going on for some time, is resolved as soon as possible so that it will not happen again?  Other State companies, such as the ESB, are an example of good practice whereas we have memories of major difficulties in some of those companies in the past.  They now have internal mechanisms to ensure we do not experience the kind of problems that are happening in Iarnród Éireann.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_238" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_411">Regarding the Deputy's question on early warning systems, the signs have been there for some time.  Patient efforts were made by Iarnród Éireann to ensure that services were maintained across the network.  The company has tried to contain the action but if one has a small group of individuals who are determined not to comply with normal industrial relations machinery and procedures, it is difficult to do much about it other than cajoling the workers to comply with obligations and agreements made.</p>
            <p eId="para_412">I do not accept that there is something inherently wrong with the situation between unions and management in Iarnród Éireann.  It must be said again and again that this is unofficial action and is not sanctioned by either trade union in the company.  It is the action of a number of individuals in the Cork-Kerry area.  Some other people in other areas went out in sympathy.  The sympathy should be with the travelling public, not those who do not appear to want to work towards a solution.  I agree that if there is a problem between unions and management there are labour relations mechanisms that can solve a dispute.  The official unions, SIPTU and NBRU, used this recently to solve it.  There is an ongoing discussion between the company and the group of unions on pay, conditions, working hours and pension improvements, which carried on for a long time before being referred, by agreement, to the Labour Relations Commission.  There was a conciliation conference on 4 March and the deputy director of conciliation issued a proposal to both parties, which exhorted the drivers to restore full co-operation with training and changes of duty and to cover absences of colleagues.  The joint NBRU-SIPTU national drivers committee unanimously accepted the Labour Relations Commission proposal and issued advice to driver members to restore co-operation.  We must make the distinction that most drivers responded positively to that and got on with their business.  A number have resolutely refused to go back and this is where the difficulties arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_413">Is the core of this wildcat strike the refusal of a driver to drive a train, which is his job?  The key to the solution of this is the draft proposal made by the Labour Relations Commission in 1992 on essential services, to which the Minister referred.  Where essential services are affected, such as rail transport in this case or the air traffic controllers strike earlier this year, we must have an agreement between the social partners — the unions and employers — and this must be based on the consent of both sides.  A "no strike" clause must apply to the new code for essential services.  Notwithstanding that it is 16 years since these proposals were first made, is it not the case that this proposal does not apply?</p>
            <p eId="para_414">Ireland has dropped 17 places in international competitiveness in a few short years.  We cannot afford to have the image portrayed that Ireland is a bad place to invest in with the cancellation of major intercity trains between the county's two largest business and urban centres for days on end.  If we have a "no strike" clause in place and if there is a new partnership agreement, as part of the Minister's role should he not intervene in partnership agreements to ensure a mandatory cooling off period of six months at a minimum in a case like this?  The vast majority of workers do not want or support this strike but a small number of wildcat strikers are getting away with it.  We must deal with them effectively in the modern economy.  We must put them outside the agreement of workers and unions who consent to this.  We must ensure our economy is not held to ransom by people refusing to drive a train, which is actually their job.</p>

            <p eId="para_415">The Deputy is correct that this particular phase of the dispute came to a head when a driver based in Cork refused to undertake a particular duty, namely, to facilitate the training of four trainee drivers.  He refused to undertake this duty on the basis that he had been assigned a different duty per his roster.  Following removal of the person concerned from the roster, 12 other drivers in Cork refused to operate their rosters.</p>
            <p eId="para_416">Previously, where such disputes arose people were suspended with pay.  However, in this case the drivers have been advised payment to them will not resume until they have returned to duty and accepted the proposal agreed by everybody else.  This is proving to be the core of the problem, the final straw, although I suspect given the background to this dispute that there is more involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_417">I share the view expressed to me today and previously by Deputy O'Dowd that a "no strike" clause should be negotiated as part of the social partnership agreements to prevent this type of irresponsible striking.  I have no difficulty saying this.  A problem arises in respect of those people who put themselves outside——</p>

            <p eId="para_419">It may be the answer but it may also cause a greater problem at the end of the day.  A difficulty arises in respect of "no strike" clauses.  As I stated earlier, we have chosen the route of partnership and have set up various mechanisms in this regard.  We now have in place as fine an industrial relations machinery as any state.  We have chosen the route of partnership rather than the introduction of draconian legislation.  However, instances like this give rise to questions such as those raised by Deputy O'Dowd and others in respect of the provision of essential services.  We need to put in place legislation to deal with the taking of unofficial action in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_420">I welcome the involvement of the Labour Relations Commission.  I hope a basis for a quick resolution of this dispute will emerge as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_421">In any public transport system commuters must come first.  It was totally unacceptable last Thursday that thousands of people were left stranded on platforms waiting for trains that did not arrive.  It is also unacceptable that many people missed important appointments and were unable to attend concerts, community games and so on.  This should not have happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_422">It appears this problem has been simmering for at least seven or eight years.  The new deal for locomotive drivers emerged in 2000.  I note that in 2006 there was to be a final resolution in respect of hours worked given an agreement in this regard had been reached in 2000.  However, this was not implemented.  It is the job of management to implement an agreement but it did not do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">Has the chief executive, Dick Fearn, and the Irish Rail management team brought to the Minister's attention since he took up office as Minister for Transport this festering industrial relations problem which needed to be resolved?  As the Minister stated, a majority of workers turned up willing and available to work but were not permitted to do so.  Is there any substance, therefore, in the charge made by SIPTU and others, that to some extent management allowed this dispute to happen?  As I understand it, the day the dispute arose an industrial relations meeting was taking place in respect of the resolution of the basic problems, including hours to be worked, which dated back to 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_424">The Minister noted the achievements of Irish Rail and mentioned it had carried as many passengers last year as Ryanair.  The Government's investment in Irish Rail is welcome as is the company's performance right across the board.  What everybody in the country wants now is for the trains to be running again.  Commuters in Cork, Mallow, Tralee, Dublin and elsewhere have been discommoded and they want the trains up and running immediately.   In that context, is it not invidious that any kind of preconditions would have been set, as happened yesterday?  The service could have been back in action as soon as possible with substantive negotiations in hand.</p>

            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_425">I agree with the Deputy that commuters must come first.  We all share the view in respect of the provision of quality customer services at all times.  Of particular importance in respect of a quality customer service is the provision of a reliable and dependable service, one from which people will not walk away at the drop of a hat.  It is important people bear this in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">I set out at a recent rail union conference the importance of providing a reliable service.  As I stated, passenger numbers have increased by almost 50% from almost 32 million passengers to 47 million passengers in a relatively short period.  With the roll-out of new stock on the Sligo, Limerick and other lines, the creation of the new hourly services between Dublin and Cork and improvements throughout the system, people are beginning to believe we have a rail system that is reliable, fast, efficient and comfortable.  The evidence exists; people are voting with their feet.</p>
            <p eId="para_427">The progress we have made during the past six or seven years can be undone in two or three days as a result of this type of strike action.  I do not believe this is acceptable.  Those responsible for this dispute are doing themselves and the company a huge disservice and they should stop it.  Deputy Broughan is correct that there have been underlying industrial relations issues in the company for almost seven years.  People are aware, however, that it takes two to tango.  As the Deputy stated, the issue first arose in 2000 following a proposal to reduce the working week for drivers, the core working hours and in respect of improvements to pensions and so on.  Discussion on these issues commenced at that time.  An improvement in the working hours for drivers was achieved in 2001 but negotiations on the matter have not yet concluded.  This also benefited pensionable pay.  In return for these concessions and making them official, the company is seeking three major changes in work practices in respect of performance pay, central rostering and contingency drivers.  These issues have been ongoing since then.  They are the background to this more immediate dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">With regard to the Deputy's other question, if people say they want to come back to work they should come back without preconditions.  They are the people on unofficial dispute and it is not unreasonable of the company to ask them to sign up to not walking out again in 24 or 48 hours if the mood takes them.  I have no issue with this from a company point of view.</p>

            <p eId="para_429">I welcome the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission and I wish it well in its efforts to get the trains back on track.  The Minister must agree that over the years CIE and Iarnród Éireann have been in an industrial backwater with archaic management and working practices.  Even though we had the modernisation of the rolling stock in recent years, some of these archaic practices still exist in management and work practices.  Yesterday, when workers indicated they would return to work they had to sign up or not be allowed back.  Did the Minister ask whether anybody realised this was akin to throwing petrol on a simmering labour relations problem?  Did anybody ask whether it was inevitable the travelling public would be victims again because of a management decision?</p>
            <p eId="para_430">I condemn wildcat strikes and unofficial strikes.  However, as the Minister stated it takes two to tango.  The very act of asking people to sign on a dotted line yesterday inflamed the situation and made it worse.  I agree the Minister cannot get involved directly in talks between management and workers.  However, the question must be asked as to why this type of inflammatory act was allowed to impose on the travelling public yesterday.</p>

            <p eId="para_431">As I stated, this was and is unofficial action.  Discussions took place some time back at the Labour Relations Commission to resolve outstanding difficulties.  A recommendation was made by the deputy director of conciliation.  He issued a proposal to the parties.  This proposal exhorted the drivers to restore full co-operation with training, changing of duties within turn and covering the absence of colleagues.  This was unanimously accepted by the trade unions, NBRU and SIPTU, and their committees.  Last Thursday, and not for the first time, several people decided they would not honour this and caused the current difficulties.  Perhaps the Deputy is more aware than I am that this is not the first time this has happened.  They went back before and came back out again.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">In these circumstances it is not unreasonable to ask people to sign up to state they will not do it again and will let the Labour Relations Commission get on with its business and deal with the issue.  I do not think it was designed to inflame the situation and nor should it.  At that time, the drivers had indicated they were willing to come back, work and co-operate on everything else.  All they were being asked to do was confirm it in writing and I do not think this was unreasonable.</p>

            <p eId="para_433">I acknowledge the inconvenience caused to the travelling public, whether they are travelling to work, social or sporting events, family meetings and the usual reasons people travel.  We are acutely aware the LRC talks have been under way for less than three hours.  We wish all those involved well and hope a positive outcome will be achieved this evening to allow people get back to work tomorrow morning and allow the public to travel and use Iarnród Éireann's facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">While I understand the Minister cannot jump in to intervene in every dispute on day one or two, can he employ a mechanism to involve the LRC much earlier in disputes such as this?  I wonder with regard to all areas and not only transport whether a mechanism can be found to involve the LRC at an earlier date to get people together and talking, sort matters out and get everybody back to business as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">It is ironic just minutes after I moved a Bill to amend the Constitution and which calls for union recognition, recognition of collective bargaining and the right to strike that we are discussing a "no strike" clause.  We had clear early warning signs with regard to this.  I understand what the Minister stated with regard to the difficulties involved.  Could a greater effort have been made by all involved, particularly management and the trade unions, to have this closed off before it came to the point of inconveniencing the public for six days?</p>
            <p eId="para_436">I share Deputy Allen's view on management seeking workers to sign up to not striking again when it was clearly an extremely fraught time.  Does the Minister accept that an opportunity existed to get people back to work and to use the time productively to try to negotiate and get everybody's head around what needs to happen, resolve possible disputes and allow the public to travel?</p>

            <p eId="para_439">——on all sides of the House for interfering in the day to day running and management of a company.</p>
            <p eId="para_440">To ensure we keep party politics out of it as much as possible we created an elaborate set of labour relations arrangements such as the Labour Court, which has been established for a long time, the Labour Relations Commissions and other ways and means such as partnership and implementation bodies, to try to ensure the people in dispute discussed the dispute and tried to resolve their difficulties through the partnership model.  It was not felt political intervention was the best way.</p>
            <p eId="para_441">Those mechanisms are in place and they were used in this instance to try to resolve outstanding difficulties.  A Labour Relations Commission report was made on this and accepted by the unions.  A group of workers decided to step outside of it.  From everybody's point of view, we are back to square one.  The mechanisms that exist should be used where necessary.  There is no excuse for this type of dispute where workers step outside the mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_442">I regard the recognition of unions as extremely important.  In the past, unions have shown themselves to be responsible in their attitude and response to the national interest.  Partnership has enshrined that.  A number of people decided they wanted to step outside of that.  One cannot make much of an effort to avert something that one does not know will happen. By its very nature, a wildcat strike flares up, as this did, even though there were underlying issues.  Now that the LRC is communicating with both union and management, that is the place to resolve this dispute rather than anywhere else and I sincerely hope it will be resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">I agree with the Minister regarding the level of service on offer on the Cork to Dublin and Tralee to Dublin routes.  It has been a success, which is evidenced by the large number of people availing of the service, and this makes last Thursday's wildcat strike all the more difficult for people to take.  It affected many people who had made plans for the weekend and it affected them yesterday and today.  Passengers cannot make plans and nobody knows where they stand for the week.</p>
            <p eId="para_444">One driver refused to operate a roster last Thursday and 12 others went out in sympathy with him.  Is 13 the total number of drivers involved?  I accept many drivers want to return to work and they are not happy with the position in which they find themselves.  This issue has been simmering for a long time and anyone who uses the rail service regularly will be aware of stoppages and delays.  When issues have flared up previously, they were resolved in a few days.  This is an unofficial dispute and I acknowledge the role the unions and the LRC are playing.  However, is the Minister committed to the introduction of a "no strike" clause, particularly for essential services?  Earlier, he seemed to indicate his support for such a provision.  Can we take it he does and that he will introduce such a clause for a limited number of essential services in order that the public will not be discommoded to such an extent?</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_252" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_445">With regard to a "no strike" clause for essential services, in 1992 under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, the LRC, following consultation with the ICTU and IBEC, prepared a code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures for essential services.  The code is designed to assist employers and trade unions in making agreements that recognise the rights and interests of the parties concerned and contains procedures that will resolve issues in a peaceful manner and avoid the need for the parties to resort to actions that would lead to a disruption of supplies and services.  This voluntary approach has worked very well in general since it was put in place.  I encourage unions and management in as many companies and essential services as possible to adopt this approach.  However, if a number of workers intend to be as disruptive as possible, all the no strike clauses in the world will not help, whether they are voluntary or provided for in legislation.  It is not up to an individual company or union to negotiate such a clause.  The way to approach this is to discuss such a provision at partnership rather than having it imposed by a Minister or a company.</p>
            <p eId="para_446">The Deputy asked about the total number of drivers involved.  One driver refused to work and he was followed by 12 others who went out in sympathy with him.  The following day a number of drivers in Athlone, Galway and Westport joined the unofficial stoppage in sympathy with the Cork drivers.  I am not sure about the total number of drivers involved nor am I sure about the total number employed by Iarnród Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">On a related issue, the union has sought reduced working hours for drivers and the company has attempted to train additional drivers in order that the agreement on reduced hours could be put in place.  A number of drivers have as little as two hours training to complete and, therefore, the action is not only causing problems for passengers, it is also causing problems for the company and the drivers who would like to work more regular rostered hours.  It is causing them difficulty because the new drivers cannot be deployed, which is regrettable.  I hope sense will prevail and the drivers who are causing major disruption will think a little more about commuters and resume the provision of a quality customer service on the routes in question.</p>

What mechanism is in place to provide for this?  Is that the equivalent of sacking somebody on the spot?  Is the Minister saying it would be preferable to suspend workers with pay and hold discussions?  Will he receive a report on the dispute from the LRC or the company when it is resolved?  Will he investigate it further to ascertain what improvements can be made in order that such an action cannot happen again?

The drivers should work in accordance with the agreements in place and trains should run, irrespective of what is happening at the LRC or anywhere else.  No suspensions should happen or be lifted on the basis of the outcome of the LRC talks.  This is an unofficial action, which should not be happening, irrespective of whether the commission is in discussions with the parties involved.  The trains should be running.</p>
            <p eId="para_450">With regard to my reference to suspensions, previously when such an action took place, drivers were suspended with pay but, in this instance, the drivers are deemed not to be available for work and, therefore, they are not being paid.

            <p eId="para_451">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to contribute.  I am a regular user of the Mallow to Dublin service and I rely on it greatly.  It is perhaps a credit to Iarnród Éireann in some respects that it has rolled out a fairly extensive service.  However, credit is also due to the existing drivers on those routes.  Some of these drivers have eaten considerably into their holiday time over the past 12 months because of the shortage of drivers and were refused leave in some instances when they sought and gave notice for leave for family occasions like confirmation or first holy communion.</p>
            <p eId="para_452">While we agree this is an unofficial strike — I particularly welcome the fact that the LRC machinery is now kicking in and I hope that both sides will come to a compromise on this — there needs to be a roll-out of the drivers as promised.  If that can be expedited so that the service is resumed and the existing drivers are not put under increasing pressure that should be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">There are two sides to this Iarnród Éireann story.  I hope it will come to a successful conclusion.  Some drivers have been very flexible in their approach with Iarnród Éireann and have been more than willing to accede to its wishes in terms of practices.  I hope Iarnród Éireann will reciprocate in kind.</p>

            <p eId="para_454">Services from the town of Tralee could be at risk.  I understand the figures regarding passengers carried from Tralee are dropping.  In view of the competition from Ryanair and so on from Cork Airport, this strike could affect the future or frequency of the service from Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_455">Rather than go into the nitty gritty of the points local people have properly made and which have been answered in many cases, the point I make is that for 14 weeks in a row this spring, the early morning commuter train from Portlaoise was cancelled because of this industrial action.  It is not something that is just confined to Cork but concerns issues that affect commuters right around the country.  In his reply, the Minister said he does not disagree with the idea of legislation to deal with this issue.  In this LRC document, the key point the commission makes is that where the parties have continued to disagree and the LRC forms that opinion, it should then consult the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC.  The document states that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">The objective of such consultation should be to secure their assistance and co-operation with whatever measures may be necessary to resolve the dispute including, where appropriate, arrangements which would provide a basis for a continuation of normal working for a period not exceeding six months while further efforts by the parties themselves or the dispute settlement agencies were being made to secure a full and final settlement of the issues in dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_457">That is the core point I make to the Minister about the "no strike" clause.  Effectively, having gone through all the options, ultimately, the LRC tells both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and business people that they must go back to work for six weeks and that it will continue to make every effort to resolve this dispute.  We must take a firm stand on this and if legislation is needed, I put it to the Minister that this is the sort of "no strike" clause that would effectively come into play at that point.</p>

            <p eId="para_459">Clearly, the right of workers to collective bargaining is a key belief of my party.  Talking about "no strike" clauses is pointless, right-wing rhetoric that does not solve the fundamental issue for commuters and the company.  The Irish Rail Users Union has spoken about the necessity for independently set and monitored standards of service that would be delivered.  I note in respect of the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority, which the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Noel Ahern, took last week because the Minister was not in the House, that, obviously, contracts of service will exist.  However, the Minister is not bringing forward a national transport regulator so in a situation like the one we are discussing this evening, there is no body that can insist on a particular type of service delivery.  Does the Minister think he should look again at the necessity for a national transport authority?</p>
            <p eId="para_460">The Minister did not respond to my earlier question about whether management at Iarnród Éireann brought to his attention the fact that it had a long-running and deep-seated problem in respect of the management of working time and the successful expansion of the network.  I understand it is training 60 drivers at present and so on.  Given that this is the case, was the Minister forewarned that this was likely to happen and could management have done more to stop it?</p>
            <p eId="para_461">The Minister spoke about people signing preconditions but the travelling public would prefer it if at least the bulk of the service would run.  There is no point in trying to make debating points when people are left without a transport service.  The most important point is to get the trains running on time and get the service back.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_259" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
            <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_462">I agree with the Deputy that it would be better to have the service back but not just for 24 hours or 48 hours or until somebody decides to take issue with an instruction again in the future.  That kind of service is no good for anybody.  What everybody wants is for the service to be resumed and for people to be able to make plans and not be left like the people last Thursday who wanted to go to rugby matches, community games or a concert and suddenly found that there were no trains to bring them.  We should not just roll over and let them back without getting them to sign anything so that they can do this again on a bank holiday weekend when they think it is a good day to have another strike.  It is not a debating point or anything else; it is a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">We have had enough of this kind of carry-on from a small number of people who are giving the rest of the drivers, the official trade union movement and the company a bad name and preventing people from making the full change to public transport.  Now that this problem is where it is, it should be resolved finally rather than resolved for 24 hours or 48 hours or until somebody decides that they will head off in a different direction again.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">I apologise for neglecting to answer Deputy Broughan's question about whether I was made aware of a deep-seated problem.  I was made aware in briefings when I came into the Department and in meetings with the company that there is an ongoing labour relations problem within the company to which I averted earlier on.  Attempts have been made to resolve this problem over a period.  The way to solve it is to use the full labour relations mechanisms of the State, as both the official unions and the management have been doing.  I encourage both sides to do this and bring the problem to some conclusion so that we will not have people trying to exploit the problem for whatever reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">I agree with the Deputy that service delivery is extremely important.  The sequence of events I have laid out in the transport area in respect of regulation is that we would set up the DTA, reform the 1932 Act and, in light of the experience, decide on the national transport authority or a national transport regulator.  That is in accordance with the programme for Government and we intend to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">I have dealt with the points made and will not delay the time of the House in respect of "no strike" clauses, with which we have dealt.  I again acknowledge that Deputy O'Dowd raised the matter.  Deputy Sherlock is correct in saying that at various times, some drivers have been under pressure.  I would say that leave could not be granted to them rather, than that leave was refused, because sufficient drivers were not available at any particular time.  Refusing to train the trainee drivers, as was the case in this instance, is not a way to relieve the problems in respect of having to work longer hours because there are insufficient drivers on the roster.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">I accept what the Deputy says regarding some drivers having to work longer hours than they want to but that is not going to be resolved by blocking the 60 people that are in training, some of whom are within two days of being fully qualified train drivers and who would expand the workforce and number of drivers, thereby taking pressure off the current drivers.  That is not the answer to that particular problem.  The answer is to allow the training to continue, as per agreements and to allow the drivers to complete their course.  That will ensure that there are sufficient staff rostered to relieve the pressures that exist.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_470">that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, having considered the need for a new prison in the Dublin area, has decided to proceed with the development of a prison in the District Electoral Division of Kilsallaghan, in the County of Fingal;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_471">that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has caused the documents specified in section 26(2) of the Prisons Act 2007 (No. 10 of 2007) relating to the development of a prison to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas together with a document containing the observations of that Minister on the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_479">(i) the erection of a 3 metre high timber fence on the outer boundary of the car park areas on the west side of the site (marked B on the map placed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Oireachtas Library on 14 May 2008), the re-design and adjustment of the car park, the lowering of the level of the car park at the boundary by approximately 1.5 metres and the imposition of a height limit for lighting fixtures in such car parks so that all the lighting fixtures shall be less than 3 metres in height off the ground;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_480">(ii) the widening of planting areas at the places marked A on the map placed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Oireachtas Library on the 14 May 2008 by not less than 4 metres, the planting, where appropriate, of larger, mature trees and the relocating of the wall further from the boundary by a similar distance not to exceed 10 metres to accommodate the widened planted area;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_481">(iii) the use of concrete, which has been treated or conditioned in such a manner as to make it visually less obtrusive, on the exterior security walls on the West and North of the development; and</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_497">that the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment are:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_498">(i) the use of a design based primarily on two storey buildings (except for the control centre), centrally based away from the perimeter with a cordon sanitaire and extensive tree screening minimising the visual and environmental impact including the impact on the local ground waters;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_500">(iii) the mitigation of potential impact from traffic by the development of a new access road diverting construction and operational traffic away from the road classified by the Minister for Transport as a regional road and assigned the number R130 in the Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 188 of 2006), the town of Coolquay in the County of Fingal and the Francis Taylor National School at Kilcoskan in the County of Fingal and the provision of a regular dedicated bus service, related to demand, linking the city of Dublin to the site of the proposed prison;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_501">(iv) the mitigation of noise, dust and other emissions by prioritising the construction of the perimeter wall that will aid the mitigation of noise, dust and other emissions and the adoption of a Construction Environmental Management Plan;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_502">(v) the management of the surface water system in a manner which controls the quality and quantity of the surface water in a manner likely to avoid any adverse effect on local water drainage systems (which management includes the use of underground attenuation storage);</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_503">(vi) the implementation of an environmental management programme to ensure the correct handling and storage of potentially contaminating materials and waste disposal;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_520">resolves to approve the development of the said prison at Kilsallaghan in the County of Fingal.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">To facilitate a more in-depth consideration of this matter, it is proposed to refer the resolution placed on the Order Paper under section 26(1) of the Prisons Act 2007, approving the development of a prison in the district electoral area of Kilsallaghan in the county of Fingal to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  Technically, the subject matter of this debate, therefore, is a referral motion, but it is agreed on all sides that we should focus on the proposed development itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The development proposed comprises eight separate and distinct institutions designed to hold a total of 1,400 prisoners on a single site of approximately 120 acres, enclosed within a single perimeter with centralised stores, work training, educational and library facilities and visitor facilities.  All the buildings, except the control centre, will be two stories or less.  The existing boundary hedgerows are being maintained.  Inside that boundary there will be a planted area 10 to 20 m in depth, then a fence, a patrol road and then a wall approximately 7 m in height.  Inside that wall is the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> which will be generally 40 m in depth before one reaches the internal fencing of the development.  Car parking for visitors and staff is outside the perimeter wall.  A dedicated public transport service to the development from the city will be provided for those visitors who wish to avail of it.  The floor area is approximately 140,000 m2.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The development of the prison facility centred at Thornton Hall will be the single biggest step in improving standards for prisoners since the foundation of the State.  Its main purpose is to replace existing sub-standard accommodation and allow greater capacity to avoid overcrowding.  It will do away with the current practice of slopping out in the Mountjoy male prison.  Instead of sharing a cell — conditions that have been criticised severely both by the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhumane or Degrading Treatment, CPT, and the former Inspector of Prisons — prisoners will be housed in individual cells meeting the requirements of the 21st century.  The new development will mean that instead of the existing situation where, on frequent occasions, there are more prisoners than beds in both the Mountjoy male prison and the Dóchas centre, there will be sufficient capacity to deal with the number of men and women being committed to prison in the Dublin area by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The new prison will mean that it will be possible to assess individual prisoners as to their level of risk and to assign them to an institution with the appropriate level of security for that prisoner.  Furthermore, it will be possible to keep feuding gangs separate from one another and their ring leaders isolated, reducing the potential for violence between prisoners.  The introduction of a <i>cordon  sanitaire</i> 40 m deep around the perimeter of the prison will make it impractical for anyone to try to throw drugs and other illicit materials over the wall into areas accessible by prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The new prison will have sufficient educational, workshop and other facilities so that all prisoners can be productively engaged.  The entire design of the complex is regimes-led, with a focus on rehabilitation.  Prisoners can progress from high-security, relatively strict regimes to step-down, apartment-style accommodation to prepare them for their re-entry into the community.  Thornton Hall prison will mean that instead of housing more than 990 prisoners on a 20 acre site, and 585 of them in one institution, we will have eight self-contained institutions with a total capacity of 1,400 prisoners on a 120 acre site.  The largest institution will hold 192 prisoners.  The design is such as to gain the maximum rehabilitative benefit from having a collection of small institutions but to also maximise the operational benefits associated with larger prisons by having one perimeter wall, central stores and maintenance service.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">By reducing existing pressure on prison capacity in the Dublin area Thornton Hall will give greater flexibility in developing other prisons.  For example, it will allow younger male offenders to be located at Wheatfield which has the proper facilities for that age group.  The detention of persons under 18 is no longer the responsibility of the Irish Prison Service and the intention is to house all offenders under 18 in Oberstown.  I expect new facilities at Oberstown to be available before the closure of the Mountjoy complex but if for any reason they are not, contingency plans are in place to keep the young males in question in a separate facility at Thornton where they will have no interaction with adult prisoners, pending completion of the necessary works at Oberstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The Prisons Act 2007 sets out a special procedure that may be applied for the purpose of determining whether consent should be granted to larger prison developments.  Prior to the Prisons Act 2007, the procedure for all prison developments was determined in accordance with Part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.  Under those regulations, the Minister of the day was effectively the deciding authority for planning matters for prisons and until the enactment of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 there was no statutory provision for an environmental impact assessment for a prison development.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The purpose of the 2007 Act was to provide a more open and transparent mechanism for major prison developments under which an environmental impact assessment, EIA, meeting EC standards must be prepared and where the Houses of the Oireachtas make the decision whether to grant development consent.  This is done in the form of a resolution, which we are discussing today, which must be then confirmed by an Act.  The confirming legislation can only be presented to the House after the appropriate resolution has been passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The initial stages of the process have already been progressed.  On 29 May 2007 the provisions of Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 was applied to the proposed prison development in the district electoral division of Kilsallaghan.  The main development is at the site of Thornton Hall in the townland of Thorntown although part of the development — mainly the access route — goes through adjoining townlands, all in the Kilsallaghan area.  While the new development has not yet been given any official name, for the sake of convenience it is normally referred to as the development at Thornton Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The Director General of the Irish Prison Service appointed Jacobs Engineering Ireland to carry out the environmental impact assessment; full copies of this are available in the Oireachtas Library.  On 29 February 2008 public notice was given of the proposed prison development, copies of the EIA and visual representations of the proposed development were made available to the public and observations and submissions were invited.  The Prisons Act 2007 provides for a six-week consultation period which ended at midnight of 11 April 2008.  The rapporteur received 130 submissions and has produced his report which has been published.  The purpose of the report of the rapporteur is to identify those who have made submissions, identify the main issues raised and to provide a summary of the submissions and observations received.  There is no provision for the rapporteur to comment on the validity or otherwise of submissions made nor is there any provision for him to make any recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">My predecessor and I have had regard to the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur in proposing the resolution now before the House.  The EIA already had identified a significant number of measures to mitigate the impact of the development on the environment and further mitigation measures are now proposed in the context of the resolution to address concerns raised during the public consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">To facilitate the Houses of the Oireachtas in their consideration of the matter, the Minister must lay before the Houses: a document stating the location, purpose and size of the development, its land use requirements and an estimate of any residues and emissions expected; an environmental impact assessment; visual representations of the exterior of the development; and the report of the rapporteur.  In addition, the Minister may also lay a document containing his observations on any of the above documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">While much of this information, in particular the EIA, has been available to Members of the House since the end of February, all the documentation mentioned was formally laid before both Houses on 14 May 2008.  As well as the report of the rapporteur, an electronic copy of all the submissions received has also been made available in the Library for the convenience of any Member who wishes to examine the original submissions.  I took the opportunity to lay a document setting out my observations pursuant to section 26(3) of the Prisons Act 2007 on the EIA and rapporteur's report.  In particular that document addresses each detailed point raised in the report setting out my observations on it.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_535">It was done quite recently, within the last week or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Moving from the background documentation to the proposed resolution, which is to be considered by the joint committee, the resolution is the consent required for the prison development at Thornton Hall to proceed.  It is, in layman's terms, the planning permission for the prison.  It follows the format prescribed by section 26 of the Prisons Act 2007, including the requirement to list the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment.  It also details some small but, for some people concerned, potentially significant alterations to the original proposals that I have made in response to concerns expressed during the public consultation process and sets out the conditions that are to be complied with in the construction of the prison.  Certain matters of concern raised are also being addressed by the Irish Prison Service in the good neighbour mission statement and operational implementation plan, and a draft has been prepared and will be finalised in consultation with local interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Before turning to the details of the issues being addressed, I repeat that while the resolution is the planning permission, it must still be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas before it takes effect.  If the necessary resolution is passed, I will introduce a two section Bill to confirm that resolution and give it statutory effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Prisons by and large do not have significant adverse impact on the general environment.  At one stage there was a view that a prison development fell completely outside that category of development that would require an environmental impact assessment.  The Prisons Act 2007, however, takes a much more proactive approach and requires an EIA in the case of every prison development that falls within the scope of that Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Any large scale development, whether it be a prison or housing estate, will affect those living in the immediate proximity of the site and, therefore, some impact is likely.  It is clear from the EIA that the overall environmental impact is not significant from a national or regional perspective, but it is also true that a number of individual residents, particularly those adjoining the main site, will be affected.  Considerable efforts have been made to minimise and mitigate the impact of the development on them.  For example, there is extensive use of tree screening and except for one building — the control centre — all the buildings are of two stories or less.  The EIA goes into considerable detail on the mitigation measures proposed to minimise impact both during the construction and operational phase.  Notwithstanding that, the public consultation process and the rapporteur's report identified very specific concerns and further measures are being taken to address those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The small numbers of people living in the immediate proximity of the prison are affected and further alterations are proposed in the resolution to mitigate the effect on them.  In particular, the existing planting area which is 10 m in depth and runs around the outer boundary will be increased in key areas by extending it by another 4 m to 10 m in depth and planting a number of mature trees to greatly enhance the screening effect for those residencies adjoining the main site.  Mature trees will provide immediate greater height and greenery to screen the perimeter wall.  This will require the main security wall to be moved further back from the boundary in some areas.  In addition, 3 m timber fencing will be installed around the car parks on the west side of the site, the parking level will be lowered and light fixtures will be kept below the height of the fence to ensure that the noise and light impact on adjoining residences is minimised.  Visually conditioned concrete will also be used on the sections of the wall most visible to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">From the outset, the major concern of the local residents has related to the possible use of the R130, a secondary route, as the main access route to the new development.  The relevant section of the R130 is a straight stretch of approximately 1.5 km in length.  It passes by a local national school.  While technically the R130 would support the traffic required for the development, concerns were expressed about the implications for the safety of children.  Recognising that these concerns were strongly held and in an effort to minimise the impact of the development on the local community, additional lands were purchased to allow a dedicated access road to be provided running from the former N2 main road direct to the main facility.  It had been intended to use the R130 in the very initial phase to allow this new access route to be completed as quickly as possible.  Once the new access route had been constructed complete with an underpass, all traffic to the development would use it and there would be no need to avail of the R130.  In the light of submissions received by the rapporteur, it is now proposed that the construction of this new access route should be prioritised and that no heavy construction vehicles will be allowed to use the R130 through Coolquay even during the construction of this new access route.  This is in recognition of the fact that there were genuine concerns locally about heavy construction traffic passing a school even if it was only for a limited period.  Some concerns were also expressed about certain emergency exits being used by service and delivery vehicles and this is being addressed in the draft resolution by ensuring that the emergency exits will never be used for deliveries or service vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The resolution includes a number of conditions.  The first is a statement that the development to be constructed must be as described in the EIA and planning notice.  As I have already mentioned, a major concern was the use of roads and the resolution imposes conditions requiring the new access route to be constructed first and makes it clear that heavy construction, delivery or removal vehicles must use the new access route and not the existing R130.  The perimeter wall is in itself an important mitigating feature, reducing the effect of noise and dust on those living in the area.  Therefore, while general construction work will begin, it is intended that the construction of the perimeter wall will be one of the first priorities.  The resolution also requires that a construction environmental management plan must be drawn up by the primary contractor before construction work begins and it must address the mitigation measures already identified in the EIA.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">While not directly relevant to the issue of development consent for the prison complex, I mention the question of a new Garda station for the area and the position regarding the Central Mental Hospital.  A new Garda station is to be provided for the area.  The Garda Commissioner has agreed that its construction will be given priority.  The new Garda station will serve the local community and will be accessible to the public from the existing R130 road rather than through the prison site.  As well as providing added local security, it will deal with any criminal offences committed within the prison complex.  The construction of the Garda station is not covered by this development consent procedure and will be subject to the normal process set out in Part 9 of the 2001 regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">From the maps and drawing, Members will note that approximately 20 acres of the original Thornton Hall site have been excluded from the proposed prison development and have been reserved as a possible site for the construction of a new Central Mental Hospital. That project is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  The resolution on the prison development has no effect one way or the other on the future of the Central Mental Hospital.  I understand that no concrete plans have as yet been drawn up for a new Central Mental Hospital on this site and that any such proposal will be subject to the normal requirements to obtain planning permission from the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">We are in a position today to take a major progressive step forward in improving the prison system.  It will not only improve the life of prisoners and prison staff but will ensure we have adequate secure and safe accommodation for the future with a real, tangible hope for improved rehabilitation work with prisoners.  Once development consent has been granted we will be in a position to finalise and sign the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">There has already been a tender competition for a public private partnership to design, finance, build and maintain the prison complex at Thornton Hall.  A number of consortia were formed and a preferred bidder has been selected.  Negotiations are at advanced stage and the aim is to finalise matters after the decision has been made about development consent.  While I have no reason to believe negotiations will not be successfully concluded, I emphasise that I am determined to get the best value for money and if the preferred bidder does not meet the necessary requirements, then other options can be pursued.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_559">that every prisoner at the facility at Thornton Hall who suffers from a drug addiction have access to a comprehensive drug detoxification programme.".</p>
          <p eId="para_560">We are debating an important motion on the proposed new prison complex at Thornton Hall in north county Dublin, but the debate we should have at this stage is one about the future direction of our prisons system.  We should ask ourselves a number of questions, not least of which is whether the current system is functioning effectively and whether it represents value for money for the taxpayer.  Are Irish prisons successfully rehabilitating criminals or are inmates coming out with the same problems and attitudes they possessed when initially sentenced?  The evidence, as derived from numerous reports, including those of the prison inspectorate, prison chaplains and the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, is that our prison system is utterly dysfunctional.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The CPT's report into Irish prisons, published in October 2007, described a scenario where inter-prisoner violence was rife, fuelled by the widespread availability of illegal drugs and the existence of a gang culture.  Three prisons were singled out as being particularly dangerous in this context, Limerick, Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution.  The fact that the latter is a facility for young people makes this finding all the more shocking.  Figures published last October indicated that more than 770 prisoners were under protective custody for their own safety in prisons nationwide, out of a total prison population of fewer than 3,500.  In the meantime, in 2007 an average of one prisoner per month died while in custody as a result of drug overdoses, murder or natural causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Our prisons are seriously overcrowded.  Why is this the case?  Part of the answer is that the Government has failed to progress measures, such as the Fines Bill — recently on the Order Paper — which aims to prevent people from being routinely imprisoned for defaulting on fines.  We have not yet had the opportunity to debate the Fines Bill, much less enact it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">In Ireland being imprisoned is no obstacle to continuing to run a drugs empire from within.  It may be somewhat inconvenient, but mobile phones help gang members and leaders to carry on their business almost as normal.  A number of mobile phones have been seized in prison searches, but the Government has yet to commit to the installation of mobile phone inhibitors across all our prisons.  I would like the Minister to explain what is holding him back from taking this urgent and important step.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The drip feed of information into the public arena in respect of what prison searches have uncovered has confused the taxpayer somewhat.  After all, it is the taxpayer that foots the bill for Irish prisons.  A year ago, a prison search in my local prison in Portlaoise uncovered an array of objects that included 17 phones, drugs, syringes, home-made alcohol, plasma TV sets, DVD players and two budgies.  With regard to the plasma TVs, a spokesman for the Irish Prison Service stated: "Electrical goods that were bought by the prisoners were allowed in [but] it was felt that type of concession shouldn't have been allowed to the extent that it was."  These events conjure up the image of an incoherent prison policy where it is not clear what rights and privileges inmates should or should not be permitted to enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Far more serious than the availability of plasma TVs in our prisons is the widespread availability of drugs.  In their most recent annual report the prison chaplains state: "The misuse of drugs continues to be a major problem in most of our prisons.  Many people will in fact have been introduced to drugs initially while they were in prison."  It is a shocking indictment on our prison system that people who enter the prison system without a drug problem can acquire one during the time they are in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The chaplains further point to the fact that drug offences are the reason many are incarcerated in the first instance.  In this context, the limited and <i>ad hoc</i> availability of drug treatment programmes within prisons is nothing short of a national disgrace.  Currently, only nine prisoners at a time can avail of the special six-week addiction treatment programme in Mountjoy.  Prisoners seeking drug-free landings to help combat their addictions are denied the facility due to chronic overcrowding.  Mountjoy, with a capacity of 920 to 930, currently has between 980 and 990 prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The Minister had the gall to inform this House last month: "With regard to demand elimination and treatment for prisoners with drug problems, the policy and strategy provides for a comprehensive range of treatment options."  The pathetic reality is that our prison drugs policy is and has been an abject failure.  The Government is not just failing the prisoner, it is failing society.  A prison system that takes a non-addict in off the streets and returns a drug addict to the same streets is, simply, shameful.  One could argue that in our prison system the chickens have come home to roost.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Government's failure to comprehensively tackle the importation of drugs into the State provides some of the inmates with career opportunities and entraps more of the inmates into a spiral of crime and addiction.  We currently have one X-ray scanner to cover all of our ports and one patrol vessel to guard our entire coastline, with one more of each promised.  I would like to know what type of cost-benefit analysis, if any, informed the decision not to provide a scanner for every port, given the impressive success rate of the lone scanner to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The consequences of the failure to invest adequately in our education system or to tackle educational disadvantage and truancy through comprehensive programmes are visible inside our prisons, where 50% of young offenders in St. Patrick's Institution are illiterate, rising to 65% for the adult prisoner population.  These figures starkly illustrate the link between educational disadvantage and crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Does our prison system address these factors? Does it provide a comprehensive literacy, education and training programme for prisoners?  The answer, unsurprisingly, is "no".  Programmes are <i>ad hoc</i> and likely to be cut short or abolished at the whim of the appropriate Minister.  Programmes such as the CONNET project disappear without a trace.  Integrated sentence management is still available, but only to the few.  The probation service is scandalously under-resourced, with provision likely to be further squeezed as our economy goes into decline.  As the Minister opposite me said, “There is not a red cent in the coffers”.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">In his last report before his death, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr. Justice Kinlen, stated that the Irish prison system was dysfunctional and lacking in educational, psychiatric and rehabilitation services.  This is a damning indictment by a man who had spent several years closely examining prisons across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">This leads to the question of the net result of all this dysfunction.  The answer is provided by the shocking rate of recidivism.  The latest figures show that 50% of prisoners re-offend within four years of their release, while 27% find themselves back behind bars within a year.  The duty of Government is to protect and uphold the common good.  It is failing spectacularly to do so in respect of its approach to prisons.  Criminals are taken off the streets for a short period of time, but this time is too short in many cases, particularly in respect of an Irish life sentence, which equates to 13 years.  Offenders are released back into society without rehabilitation, leading to a staggeringly large proportion of them reoffending and being re-incarcerated within a short period.  This is not an issue of public safety alone, although clearly public safety is the key issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">In an era when the Government is happy to close hospital beds and take teachers away from schools, the taxpayers of Ireland are spending almost €100,000 per prisoner per annum to maintain a revolving door prison system.  Is this value for money?  Is it fair to the taxpayer?  A defining feature of successive Fianna Fáil Governments is the willingness to spend other people's money without a second thought.  Ministers frequently boast about spending "their money" as if the Exchequer was a personal account, rather than taxpayers' money to be used for the purposes of careful investment in crucial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">This disregard for prudent spending is abundantly obvious in regard to the purchase of land at Thornton Hall.  The Comptroller and Auditor General found that the site purchased at Thornton Hall was 50% bigger than the size of the site originally sought; the Department did not seek professional advice on the potential impact that advertising its interest in acquiring land would have on the price that it would likely have to pay; the  OPW failed to adhere to the rules in regard to procurement of professional services; the Department failed to consider cost per acre in its evaluation process; and, the State twice ended up negotiating a sale with a single vendor with no effective degree of competition, thereby weakening hand of the State as a negotiator.  Most damming of all, the State failed to secure value for money, paying way above the market value of agricultural land in the area at a cost of €200,000 per acre, leaving the taxpayer with a total bill of €40 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The Thornton Hall project has been characterised by ineptitude from its earliest days.  The idea of a new, modern prison which could address the manifold shortcomings of existing prisons is a sound one, but, as usual, the Government has taken a good idea and sought to replace the positive aspects with a host of negatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The Minister plans to demolish Dóchas, the women's prison, considered one of the few modern and effective prisons in the State, notwithstanding the need for more space.  Dóchas was built ten years ago at a cost of €30 million, but now the Minister proposes to demolish it and relocate to Thornton Hall.  He proposes to accommodate young offenders at Thornton Hall, a breach of international law and human rights.  He promises this will be a temporary measure, yet how can anybody trust this promise?  He proposes to criminalise the mentally ill by moving the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall.  This is despite the likely brain-drain that such a move would precipitate given the reluctance of expert staff to relocate and the assessment by independent economists that it would be more effective to redevelop the Dundrum campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Government proposes to detain asylum seekers at Thornton Hall in direct opposition to international best practice.  If ever a Government was capable of turning a potential positive into a resounding negative it is this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Fine Gael believes it is not acceptable to turn Thornton Hall into a super-sized crime academy where prisoners are locked away with no effort made to persuade them away from a life of crime.  Instead Thornton Hall must be part of a new approach to prisoners characterised by a focus on rehabilitating serious criminals.  The new prison must not become somewhere where current dysfunctional trends are permitted to magnify.  Fine Gael proposes every prisoner has access to vocational training, psychological assistance, drug detoxification programmes and education.  They must also have a dedicated management programme to re-integrate them into the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Thornton Hall should focus on the most serious offenders — the murderers, gangland criminals, rapists and violent burglars.  The last any reasonable person wants is for expensive prison spaces to be taken up by minor offenders or debt defaulters who should not be in prison at all.  I am calling on the Minister to reject plans to place women, juvenile offenders, asylum seekers or those with mental health problems at Thornton Hall.  They have no place in a facility designed for serious offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Thornton Hall presents the Government with an opportunity to critically evaluate its prison policy.  Years of turning a deaf ear to the reports of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, the prison chaplains and the Council of Europe has compounded failures.  It is time the Government faced up to its mistakes and set about comprehensively addressing them.  It is important the Government does not allow an opportunity pass to address a prison policy that has so long been characterised by failure.  The Minister owes it to the people to deliver an effective and rehabilitative prison programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">It has been some time since we have had a debate on prison policy in the House.  I hope the Minister will take on board the sound proposals in amendment No. 1 to the motion.  There will also be an opportunity at the justice committee to hear the Minister's proposals and the local community's concerns.  The Minister will have an opportunity to deal with the various recommendations from domestic and international reports on our prison system.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Prison must be a place where serious offenders are detained and their liberty removed.  It must provide an opportunity to treat, educate and rehabilitate in accordance with human rights concerns and international best practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_585">This motion would be regarded in any functioning democracy as a hugely controversial one.  It is not controversial because it facilitates the closure of the unsuitable, out-of-date prison environment at Mountjoy and the creation of more appropriate prison places elsewhere.  That central proposition is not contested.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The motion is immensely controversial for several reasons.  When passed by both Houses, it will authorise the construction of the largest, most expensive prison in the history of the State at a manifestly unsuitable location.  The manner of purchase of this site was unorthodox, unwise and did not comply with established procedures.  The cost of the site at Kilsallaghan at €200,000 per acre exceeded the variable cost of land in the area by a factor of between 2 and 5.  The community at Kilsallaghan is not an appropriate location for a prison.  The international trend is away from large scale prisons.  There is little evidence of a more enlightened or imaginative penal policy informing the largest decision in prison provision since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">There are two further reasons this motion the Dáil is being asked to endorse is controversial.  First, the developer who is the preferred bidder under the public private partnership arrangement to deliver the new prison is the same developer who last week withdrew from a similar arrangement with Dublin City Council to build five different housing developments.  Second, it is Government policy to relocate the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Thornton Hall, although the wisdom of such a decision is vehemently contested by expert opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The value for money issue is decided.  The horse has bolted and the taxpayer has been taken for a king's ransom.  Taking the most modest calculation — that of the Comptroller and Auditor General — it seems the State has paid twice the market value of the land.  Put simply, it would appear that having failed to purchase their desired site, the Minister and his agents let it be known they were in the market for a site that might be purchased for up to €30 million.  Not surprisingly, they were offered a farm precisely for that amount — 150 acres at Kilsallaghan — even though the instructions to the Office of Public Works were for 80 acres.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The fear now is that having acquired 150 acres, the Government must be seen to attempt to develop it.  The prospect of moving the women's prison and the Central Mental Hospital to Thornton Hall, therefore, is held out as the medium-term plan.  The Office of Public Works had advised that it would be best to proceed confidentially.  Once it became known the State was the client the price it argued would inevitably go up.  That advice was ignored.  Although Departments must comply with EU procurement directives in acquiring professional services and consultants, that was not done here nor was there a formal contract.  There was no competitive tendering for professional services.  There was no consistency in the evaluation of the site.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General summarised in his 2005 report:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">There are a number of respects in which the marks awarded by the site selection committee appear to be inconsistent ... One site got a significantly lower mark than two others in respect of availability of site services, even though the consultants estimated that the cost of provision of water, sewerage and energy services would be higher at the other sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">There may be compelling reasons the site was identified and purchased in this unorthodox manner but if there are they have not been put into the public domain.  It is not difficult to imagine that the purchase of a site for a prison is not exactly a straightforward undertaking.  However, one is left with the impression that, at the height of the boom, the sky was the limit, the taxpayer could afford to pay and a deal was sealed that for whatever reason bordered on the reckless.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">There is a certain irony in the fact that the man who sat atop this squandering of taxpayers' money was the very man who devoted a large part of his political life to lecturing the rest of us on public spending.  It has never been properly explained how he became mired in this decision, one of the most foolhardy purchases in the history of the State.  How did he become suckered into it and what kind of Cabinet allowed itself to sanction it?  It seems now that in order to put the redundant acres to some use, both the women's prison and, temporarily, places for youth detention, but most seriously of all, the Central Mental Hospital, will be transferred to Kilsallaghan.  People concerned with the most successful innovations at Dóchas, the women's prison, believe that the proposed transfer is most unwise and profoundly mistaken in policy terms.  People concerned with the Central Mental Hospital today published a well argued report entitled, Patients Not Prisoners, exposing why it is wholly undesirable to uproot such a hospital from its long established communal setting in Dundrum and juxtapose it with a prison in such an isolated setting.  The decision to railroad through such a large scale traditional development for the incarceration of prisoners at such an unsuitable location raises the major question as to what extent, if at all, has this massive, new, expensive prison decision been informed by modern thinking in terms of penal policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">In a recent paper by Paul O'Mahony, the author elaborates on his assertion that our prisons have played a key role in developing a flourishing drugs environment throughout the country.  It is estimated that 75% of prisoners have an addiction to drugs or alcohol or both.  Mountjoy prison, it can reasonably be said, is the largest drugs treatment centre in the country.  However, it cannot reasonably be argued that it is equipped to deal with that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The annual report of the Irish Prison Service for 2005 shows that 40% of people sentenced to imprisonment received sentences of three months or less; eight out of every ten people sentenced were given terms of less than 12 months.  Most prison sentences that year were for crime at the lower end of the scale of gravity and 85% were for non-violent offences.  In short, for every ten prisoners serving a sentence for a headline crime such as murder, manslaughter and sexual offences, there are 12 in prison for property crimes without violence.  Would it not be more appropriate for the Government and the prison authorities to focus on how the number of prison places might be reduced, and how to extend the use of alternative penalties as a more effective response to those who come before the courts?  Should the Government not be focusing on how to wean as many prisoners as possible off the drugs habit rather than fulminating about a drugs-free prison environment that everyone knows is only hot air?  Ought the Government not concentrate on how to keep young people out of a prison environment and estranged from the prison mentality?  In so far as some provision for the detention of women prisoners is unavoidable, does the Government not agree that the necessary supports should be available to Dóchas to continue to develop along present lines, where it is, as distinct from being housed within the confines of a predominantly male prison?  I invite the Minister to respond to what the rapporteur records in his report at paragraph 9.4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_595">The relocation of the Dóchas Centre is a backward step. The retention of it at its current location must be given further consideration. There appears no purposeful reason for the relocation of both this centre and the Training Unit other than to maximise the revenue realised from a sale of the full Mountjoy site.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">This is the opinion of a man who has not committed himself too much in the report.  If, as reported, it costs the taxpayer of the order of €100,000 per prisoner <i>per annum</i> , surely even in financial terms alone there is a strong argument to rethink our traditional approach.  The latest figures suggest that the average number of prisoners held in Mountjoy is 860.  We are being asked essentially to consider a planning proposal that could accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners.  The proposed configuration of confinement arrangements at Thornton Hall in terms of penal reform gives rise to many questions.  These questions cannot be teased out here but are more appropriate to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights.  The legislative workload on the select committee is disproportionately severe but the joint committee — which has a less onerous workload — ought to give audience to certain interested organisations and persons who have substantial points to make in the period before the Houses of the Oireachtas approve the proposal before us.  I have a communication from a Member of the other House, Senator Joe O’Toole, suggesting that the joint committee would make arrangements to hear submissions from interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">In conclusion, Mountjoy is unsuitable to continue as a prison.  Although 1,000 new prison places have been provided in the past decade it is perhaps inevitable that the extent of violent crime in our society will make more places necessary.  However, Kilsallaghan is a costly folly on the taxpayer and an unwelcome imposition on a community ill suited to cope with such a development.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">I am extremely disappointed that the Green Party has failed to be present in the Chamber.  I recall the public representative for Thornton, the current Minister for vegetables, making the most extreme promises to the various public meetings which were held by local residents and I recall Green Party candidates doing the same at that time.  The Green Party manifesto declared that, " the Green Party will abolish plans to relocate Mountjoy to Thornton Hall and instead review options to refurbish and extend the present buildings".  It is cowardly of the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, not to be present in the Chamber to account for his complete U-turn and his ignoring of the obligations which he entered into, I assume with some honour, at the various public meetings in the run-up to the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">This proposal reflects the boom years of the Celtic tiger when the obsession of the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was with property speculation and the facilitation of that golden circle that seemed in those days to continuously surround Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt that the current move to bring forward this proposal at this time is very much linked to the recent stories about the preferred financial bidder, the developer who has walked away from three to five regeneration PPPs in Dublin city, three of which, I understand, have been subject to some kind of contract and two are to be subject to a preferred bidder status, as in this case.  The Minister has a question to answer as to whether the preferred bidder status stands in the context of this developer walking away from commitments of up to €1.5 billion in Dublin city.  Is the Government seeking to shore up the status of this particular developer by bringing forward and assuring his status with regard to this development?  The decision to locate the women's prison — one of the few bright lights in penal reform — on this site is a disgrace.  It is an insult to the successive women Deputies on all sides of the House who fought for penal reform with respect to women in prison and got it during the years of the Rainbow coalition Government, manifested in the Dóchas women's prison at the Mountjoy site, Dóchas being the Irish word for "hope".</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The proposal to bring the Central Mental Hospital out to Thornton is particularly wrong.  People in this hospital are patients rather than prisoners, although in some cases they have done horrific things and probably will have to remain in custody for the rest of their lives.  This is regressive policy implementation at its very worst.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">We are now in changed financial circumstances.  The economics of this prison development no longer stand up.  The Minister previously talked about being concerned by red cents, but he now has an opportunity to reconsider this grandiose, overblown and overpriced proposal.  It is not in the interests of the financial future of this country.  Neither is it in the interests of the rehabilitation of those who have committed crimes and their eventual re-entry into society.</p>

          <p eId="para_604">On a number of occasions, I had the opportunity to visit Mountjoy with community school students who were studying in transition year.  The prison officers used to ask if we would like the rough or smooth version of the tour, but there was only a rough version.  On that basis, therefore, I welcome the principle of new prison facilities for inmates.  I agree with previous speakers who referred to the Dóchas women's facility.  There was some hope there and whoever named it, did so appropriately.  However, it would be a retrograde step to relocate that prison to Thornton Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">A new planning permission process has been used for the development of this facility.  Local people will have an opportunity to make observations but unfortunately, as with other State developments, they tend to be just that — observations and nothing else.  It is a token gesture for local people whose lives will certainly be changed when a quiet backwater will accommodate up to 2,200 inmates on that site, along with a Garda station and other developments.  The synergy of that area will never be the same again.  The Minister should take the observations of local residents on board.  A development of that size should not proceed without their views being considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The cost of the site has been mentioned at €40 million for 150 plus acres.  Speaking as a farmer, it is cracked; nobody in their right mind would ever consider paying that price for that amount of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">As regards the PPP, the McNamara group has not been named but I am naming it now.  It has attempted to withdraw from €900 million worth of PPP housing contracts with local authorities in Dublin city.  I question how somebody is attempting to take the opportunity to withdraw from a housing PPP worth €900 million and then becomes the preferred bidder for Thornton Hall.  I wonder if there is a penalty for that.  Can he just walk away with impunity or take his risk with the courts?  Perhaps the State will not pursue those PPP contracts.  It is a crazy scenario whereby somebody can say: "There's a bit of a risk there guys.  I'm not that interested, but I'll go with the Thornton Hall deal because the risk is much lower as the State will be paying me."  The PPP deals are certainly a cash crop for developers who get paid every month for costings, professional fees, maintenance and their margin.  When one consults the record of the McNamara group in recent years, one can see that it has won five of seven PPP housing deals.  He has been hugely successful in other projects throughout the State in recent years.  There is a perception that if McNamara is in for this — in particular where there is a low risk — he will get it.  We need to scrutinise and analyse how one person can be hugely successful in those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">As regards any version of the Tallaght strategy for the prison service, Fine Gael is willing to accommodate the proposed prison services if our amendments are considered on Committee Stage.  In such a case, we would be in favour of these new prison places.  However, women and minors should not be relocated on this site under any circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">I refer to the juvenile justice aspect of this motion.  As part of the Mountjoy complex, St. Patrick's Institution, which deals with 16 to 21 year old offenders, is to close when Thornton Hall prison is completed.  The Government has also decided to develop new children's detention facilities on a State-owned site at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  The fact that we are at a relatively advanced stage in the development of Thornton Hall, with little or no progress in the development of facilities for 16 to 18 year olds, indicates to me that the Minister will have a significant problem on his hands by 2011.  This is because the State will not have appropriate space to deal with that age group.  This very real scenario will be in direct contravention not only of the Children Act 2001, which stipulates that all children who are detained must be kept in suitable detention centres, but also of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Government has no integrated plan to deal with the separation of juveniles from adults once St. Patrick's Institution is closed.  In answer to a recent parliamentary question I tabled, the previous Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said "In the interim, 16 and 17 year old boys may continue to be detained in St. Patrick's Institution".  He also referred to "those who will continue to be held there pending the new development at Lusk".<b> </b> This reply seems vague and displays a non-committal attitude to the issue of developing appropriate facilities for juveniles.  The previous Minister also stated that “The development at Lusk, which is a children detention school model and not a prison, will require careful planning and consultation”.  The term “careful planning and consultation” would again indicate that the Government is way behind in developing the juvenile facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">Furthermore, the previous Minister practically admitted that Thornton Hall will be used for juvenile offenders when he said: "Should it be required when the Mountjoy complex is closed, interim accommodation for 16 and 17 year old boys, segregated from adults, will be provided on the Thornton Hall campus, pending the provision of children detention school facilities.  On completion of the detention school development project in Lusk, all children under 18 years of age being detained will only be accommodated in dedicated children facilities."</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I note that in his earlier speech to the House, the new Minister confirmed that children will be accommodated in the Thornton Hall facility.  This situation is totally unacceptable and is in breach of the Children Act 2001.  The Government appears incapable of planning for the future of such juveniles.  The Minister has an opportunity to develop appropriate juvenile facilities for this century, as part of an overall integrated detention school and prison package.  However, he continues to run the risk of placing juveniles on the same campus as more mature prisoners, thereby failing to break the cycle that has continued for generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Minister should give a clear indication of how he proposes to proceed with the development of facilities for juveniles.  He should outline a specific timeframe for the Lusk project.  He should also tell this house how he will fast-track the juvenile detention centre at Lusk so it can be delivered in parallel with the Thornton Hall project.  There is a distinct possibility that the continued pursuit of the Thornton Hall prison without integrating the plan for a specific juvenile detention centre and its associated rehabilitative measures such as education, training and restorative justice will perpetuate the mistakes that have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Minister cannot think that merely creating a super prison will cure all ills.  We have a stack of reports such as the 20 year old Whitaker report, the 1994 report on the management of offenders and the 2002 report on the reintegration of prisoners by the National Economic and Social Forum all pointing out the same things.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">We in Fine Gael say it is time the Minister dealt with this problem and put the necessary measures in place to prevent the housing of juvenile offenders with adult prisoners in Thornton Hall.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_617">I will speak about the judicial process by which individuals end up in places such as Mountjoy and, possibly, Thornton Hall.  I will speak specifically about mandatory sentences for the possession and sale of certain amounts of drugs and the impact the most recent Criminal Justice Act 2007 has had and how it is viewed by the Judiciary.  I have corresponded extensively with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Courts Service and have come to the conclusion that no one, either in the Oireachtas, the Department or in the Courts Service, is aware whether the Judiciary is abiding by the guidelines set down by the Oireachtas in this House in 2007.  I do not believe the Courts Service is active in getting that information.  Given the effect of the illegal drugs trade on society I would consider that reasonably important information that needs to be gathered and assessed by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Considering the mandatory drug provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 are a rewrite of the impotent provisions included in the Criminal Justice Act 1999, it is time to determine whether the Judiciary is taking the views of the Legislature seriously enough.  If the answer is that the Judiciary is not abiding by the new guidelines, it is time to consider the issue of its discretionary powers.  In regard to the possession of large amounts of drugs and the sentences being handed down, the sentencing regime is not having a substantial impact on the overall levels of importation of drugs and on the general drug culture.  This is after much hard talk from the benches opposite in 2006 and 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">In April 2008 I received a response from the Courts Service on this issue.  It said that the number of people who received the mandatory ten-year minimum sentence for misuse of drugs under Part 5 of the 2007 Act is 22 but it added that part of the sentence was suspended in 12 of these cases due to exceptional and specific circumstances.  I wrote again asking the Courts Service to specify the reasons a suspended sentence was handed down in those 12 cases.  On one hand, it said the courts have full discretion.  It was made clear that there is clear and detailed legislative language the Judiciary need to act within and take account of.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">It appears to me that every one of these court cases needs to be analysed to determine whether the Judiciary is acting in accordance with the legislation and within the guidelines set down.  If the Judiciary is not acting in accordance with the legislation it is time for the House to consider the Judiciary's discretionary powers in the matter of mandatory sentences for the possession of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">We in this House have a serious role to play in the area of illegal drugs which revolves around sentencing.  At the very least, we need to determine on an active and regular basis, whether the legislation that purports to act as the main deterrent to drug importation, trafficking, and the sale and supply of drugs is working.  As it stands, the Government agency tasked with determining whether the legislation in question is being acted upon is not capable of answering the most basic questions regarding the implementation of such a pivotal Act and its provisions.  This is an issue about which the House should be concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I thank Members for their comments.  Any criticisms they made were in regard to the prior system which revolved around Mountjoy, a prison built in the 1850s where it is impossible to run a 21st century prison service that is fair to everyone, not just staff, but prisoners and families.  It is impossible to run that type of service from Mountjoy prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The whole reason for the new prison is to try to relieve some of the pressure in the Dublin area.  Part of that will address the issue of dealing with young male offenders who, hopefully, can be located in Wheatfield which has the proper facilities for that age group.  In regard to the under 18 age group, it is expected the facilities at Oberstown will be available long before the new Thornton Hall prison will be put in place.  It is impossible to run a prison service from a prison such as Mountjoy, which was built so long ago and has been added to, in the context of trying to rehabilitate prisoners, proper security and ensuring that items such as drugs are not thrown over walls and so on.  That is one of the reasons for a brand new prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Dóchas is probably the most overcrowded centre in the country.  A judgment had to be made.  It makes no sense from an economic or practical point of view to continue with Dóchas and build a second prison to house the overflow of female prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I wish to clear up facts in regard to some comments made about the probation service.  There has been massive investment in the probation service.  During the past two years alone, there has been a 30% increase in staffing in the probation service.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The design of Thornton Hall will take full advantage of all the best lessons that have been learned from the Dóchas centre.  It will have single occupancy domestic style accommodation based around courtyards.  It will have three separate sections in order that, for example, women on remand can be kept separate from sentenced prisoners.  Also at Thornton, women prisoners will be further away from male prisoners than at present in the Mountjoy complex——</p>

          <p eId="para_631">In regard to the PPP arrangement, some Members have likened it to the PPP arrangement for the regeneration of Dublin city centre and that involving Dublin City Council.  It is a different type of PPP arrangement.  McNamara and Company is just one element of the consortium selected as the preferred bidder.  Nothing has been said to me that would suggest that consortium will not be in a position to go ahead once the development consent has been given.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">The technology to inhibit the use of mobile phones is currently nearing completion in the midlands prison.  It will then be evaluated and rolled-out across the prison estate.  Prison numbers in the State have increased.  At one stage the numbers were artificially low because of the revolving door mechanism.  This Government and previous Governments, of which I have been a member, have endeavoured to ensure we do not have a revolving door mechanism.  What was happening was that prisoners were being released to make room for new committals.  The number of prisoners has increased because of that and because of longer sentences, particularly life sentences.  The sentences being served by life prisoners have been increased to fairly significant levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The capacity of Thornton Hall is based on the study carried out by the Irish Prison Service on projected prison numbers for the period 2005-13.  We need this new development to proceed as quickly as possible if we are to avoid problems of overcrowding.  Irrespective of Members' views, I know they do not want overcrowding in our prisons.  I would welcome the support of all sides to allow us to proceed with the development in Thornton Hall.</p>

It specifically addresses promises made and broken by a Government which treats local school communities as mere pawns on a chess board, there to be used and abused as fodder for the Fianna Fáil Party at election time.  In short, class size matters and the scandal of super-size classes being acceptable in education must become a thing of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It matters that six and seven year old children must try to learn in classes of 30 pupils or more, many weaker pupils are being left behind because crowd control is now the order of the day in so many of our schools, Ireland has one of the highest average class sizes in the European Union and this Administration has reneged on a clear commitment that this issue would be addressed in its first three years.  Instead of making progress on class size, we have been moving in the opposite direction in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has a golden opportunity to wipe the slate clean and begin delivering on the promises made so forcefully by his party only 12 months ago.  He could send out the most positive signal to date on class sizes by agreeing to this motion, the terms of which would prevent the loss of teachers in schools from September only where they would otherwise have kept the teachers had the Government kept its word.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Meeting the terms of the motion would not create a significant cost in the context of the Department's €9.3 billion expenditure allocation for this year.  The Minister would give a small sign of goodwill and show flexibility on this issue if he were to accept the motion which would only affect a small number of schools.  The schools cited would not lose a teacher if the Government had kept its word.  This is the reality they face.  Amending the staffing schedule is possible for the schools in question and would indicate a strong sign of intent on the Minister's part that he takes seriously the issue of class size and intends to deliver on it during his stay in Marlborough Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Six years after Fianna Fáil promised that by 2007 no child of nine years or under would be in a class of 20 or more, at least 200,000 children find themselves in this position.  We do not know if this promise still holds.  I want the Minister to state unequivocally where he stands on the commitment.  Has he dumped the promise made by his party in 2002 or is it still a priority?  This is a straight question to which I want him to give a straight answer on the record tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">All the evidence shows that early intervention and small class sizes, particularly for younger children, make a major difference in terms of giving children the best start in school.  While smaller classes are not of themselves the only factor in improved educational outcomes, when allied to school leadership, professional development, learning supports and support for special needs, these factors can make all the difference in the early years.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">I have been the Fine Gael Party education spokesperson for the past eight months and throughout that time I have not yet met anyone involved in education who can justify how a young child can possibly be given every opportunity in large classes.  It is beyond comprehension that in 2008 anyone would claim that seven year old children can get the attention they deserve in classes with as many as 35 children.  The motion is important because the Minister can start a process, albeit in a small way, by sending out a signal that large classes in our primary schools will not be tolerated and will become a thing of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Minister will no doubt point to the new teachers who are being appointed and inform us again of the commitment in the programme for Government to provide 4,000 additional teachers during the lifetime of this Administration.  What he will not tell the House is that the vast majority of new teachers appointed will simply go to serve the massive intake of new children entering our primary school system every year.  We have more teachers because we have more children coming into the system.  Unless a start is made on reducing the staffing schedule, no progress will be made on eliminating large class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The schools referred to in the motion have been the victims of a Soviet-style planning system which the Department of Education and Science describes as the "staffing schedule".  On one day last year — 30 September — the Department asked schools all over the country how many children were on their rolls.  In the vast majority of the schools referred to in the motion, last year's enrolment showed numbers had fallen by one or two on the previous year.  This small change has resulted in the loss of a teacher in each of the 28 schools despite the fact that many of them have enrolled more children since 30 September last year.  This is a ridiculous way to run a system.  Schools which experienced a tiny reduction in their numbers were confident they would not lose a teacher because the programme for Government includes a commitment to reduce the staff schedule.  However, the commitment was made before the election when, in typical Fianna Fáil style, promises were made to be broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Many Deputies will use this debate to place on record the implications of this broken promise for schools in their constituencies and we make no apologies for doing so.  One of the schools listed in the motion is in my constituency of Dublin South-West.  The implication for St. Killian's senior national school, which is in my parish of Kingswood Heights in Tallaght, is that the four current fifth classes will have to be reorganised as three sixth classes, each with 30 pupils.  Such a measure would break the Department's guidelines on maximum class size.  Moreover, each of the three classes will contain pupils with special educational needs who need additional one-to-one attention due to their circumstances.  The teacher who will be lost to St. Killian's is currently doing postgraduate work and study in the area of inclusion and special educational needs.  This is an example of a real teacher in a real school being let down by the Minister's stroke politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">During Question Time last week, the Minister suggested his Department's failure to adhere to the proposed staffing schedule was due to the current economic and budgetary environment and a need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  However, in light of the already overcrowded conditions in classrooms, significant evidence of chronic under-funding of schools, over-reliance on temporary accommodation, dependence on voluntary contributions from parents, cutbacks in grants for minor works and summer works, excessive waiting lists for special needs assessment and services as well as excessive water charges, the commitment on class sizes is the latest in a long line of promises to be broken by the Government and the current programme for Government is not yet one year old.  Now is not the time to make education pay for the economic incompetence of this Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Irish class sizes are among the largest in the EU and regarding the OECD — they are just above Korea, Chile, Japan, Turkey, Israel and Brazil.  At primary level, the average class size across OECD countries is 22 students per class, while the average in the EU is 20.3.  The average primary school class in Ireland comprises 24.3 pupils.<b>  </b>We have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Since the start of this year I have tried to obtain from the Minister for Education and Science the list of schools that would lose out from this broken promise.  I was first told it was about 50 schools.  Having raised the matter as a priority question on 9 April, I was told that information would be sent soon after.  As the then Minister, Deputy Hanafin, left the Department by the back door, I finally got the list on 6 May and it contained the names of 40 schools that would lose out.  However, when the schools were contacted, only 28 were sure that they had received correspondence from the Department confirming that they would lose a teacher this September.  Either some schools still have to be informed by the Minister and his Department or I have deliberately been given misinformation by the Minister.  Either way, it represents a shocking indictment of the Minister and his Department, and the way in which schools are routinely treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Members opposite have a choice to make tonight and tomorrow night.  They either support schools in their own areas and the commitments made in the programme for Government or they can face the wrath of those communities.  I propose this motion and I submit that this is the way forward and must play a part in education.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_687">I second Deputy Hayes' motion in the name of the Fine Gael Party and I thank him for sharing time with me.  This Private Member's motion highlights the Government's failure to adhere to a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce class size on a year by year basis, eventually ensuring that there will be one teacher for every 24 students by 2011.  It remains unclear how many schools and teachers will be affected by this failure.  Some 28 schools have declared a loss of teachers, but many others will receive notification of further cuts from the Department in the next couple of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The new Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has suggested that his Department's failure to adhere to the proposed staffing schedule is due to the current economic and budgetary environment.  However, the Government also reneged on its commitment during the Celtic tiger era of budget surpluses.  The programme for Government in 2002 stated that the Government would continue to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in our schools and would progressively introduce maximum class guidelines, ensuring that the average class size for children under nine would be below the international best practice ratio of 20:1.  When the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was challenged on those promises, she admitted that this was a noble aspiration.  Nothing has been done on this issue since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The programme for Government in 2007 stated that the Government would increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000, which would enable it to reduce class sizes, while the pupil-teacher ratio would be reduced from 27:1 in 2007 to 24:1 in 2012.  It was agreed to reduce class sizes, but the Government did a U-turn on the issue when it abandoned the commitment for economic reasons in last December's budget.  The programme for Government pledged to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 26:1 by September 2008, but the Government reneged on this promise earlier this year.  As a result, schools that would have kept their full complement of teachers will instead see teachers sacked.  I ask the Minister to rescind his predecessor's order regarding the schools involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">There are overcrowded classrooms across the country, with 200,000 pupils in classes of 20 or more.  The OECD report stated that Irish classes are the largest in Europe, with an average of 25 per class in 2005.  In County Galway, there has been an increase in the number of students in classrooms with over 30 pupils from 2,500 in 2001 to 2,787 in 2007.  A quarter of all students in Galway are in classes of 30 or more.  Can the Minister state that he is committed to reduce class sizes to that planned originally in 2002, or even that planned in 2007?  I support themotion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_691">I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on his tenacity in bringing this motion before the House tonight.  It is an issue that was extremely important in last year's general election.  We all remember the campaign by the INTO to highlight the fact that the previous Government did not follow through on its commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in classrooms, particularly in primary education.  That was a real issue for parents, students and teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The Minister represented my constituency of Cork South Central until the last election.  In that area, three schools are losing teachers.  The boys' schools in Turner's Cross and Beaumont are losing one teacher each, while the boys' school in Douglas is losing two teachers.  I spoke to the principals of those schools and they are not losing teachers because of falling numbers but because of a commitment made by the Government that it would reduce the pupil-teacher ratio from 27:1 to 26:1 and because they based their enrolment policy last year on that commitment.  Last week, they received a letter from the Department stating that they would be losing those teachers, even though there will be extra demand for places in some of those schools this September.  This means that the pupil-teacher ratio will go up instead of down.  That is the sting in the tail for those schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">What is so disappointing is that this does not really involve a large amount of money as each post would cost about €60,000.  Even just restricting this to the 28 schools that are losing teachers, it is not a great amount of money in the overall budget.  The Minister and his colleagues should consider this motion.  Many of them made a commitment in front of packed halls last year to pupils that they would support a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Now is their opportunity to do it.  It will not break the budget and I ask the Minister to look at this issue.  It is his first opportunity to come before this House for Private Members' business and it would be a break with precedent set by his colleague.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The OECD report showed that 4.6% of our GDP is spent on education.  That is very low compared to the OECD average of 5.8%.  I heard Professor Drumm on the radio suggesting we should not compare ourselves to Germany in respect of health spending because it has an older population.  If that is the case, we should be spending above the EU average because our population is so young.  The pupil-teacher ratio is not just about space for desks or cubic capacity for pupils but about giving teachers an opportunity to do the job they are trained to do: imparting information, supporting individual students and helping pupils with needs.  Anyone who visits a school will see it is not a question of standing in front of rows of students and using a blackboard but of group teaching and supporting students in groups, which demands more attention and time from teachers.  It is not rocket science that the fewer students a teacher has, the more support can be given to individual students.  It is accepted Government policy and I ask the Minister to review this matter.  It is small beer in the overall scheme of things but it will make a major difference to these schools, pupils and teachers.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">I thank Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this motion.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Last year we had a crisis in schools because of water charges and a few months later some national schools are engulfed in a crisis of cuts in staff numbers.  The importance of a first-class primary education cannot be stressed enough because it is the foundation of all further education and the period in which lifelong aspects of personal character are initiated and shaped.  A well educated population has been the cornerstone of our economic success.  Investment in education has delivered a well educated, highly confident and motivated population well equipped to take advantage of the opportunities in the global economy.  After last year's election the agreed programme for Government promised to reduce class size.  Specifically, the Government said that class sizes were to be reduced in 2008-09 and over the following three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I am delighted that people from Rathcormac national school are here this evening.  On 30 September last year the school had 229 children on the roll, in line with the expected retention figure as outlined in the Government's commitment to reducing class sizes, but recent U-turns by the Fianna Fáil-led Government has decreed that this enrolment figure is not high enough to retain all current staff members.  As a result of the Government decision not to honour its commitment to reduce class size each year over the next three years, Rathcormac national school has been informed that one teaching post is to be suppressed on 31 August.  Once more, the Government has broken its promise to the parents of school-going children and let down the children.  My son attends a class of 34 students so I speak with knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">School enrolment figures are set to rise in Rathcormac national school for the foreseeable future.  Next September it is expected that 233 pupils will attend the school.  If the school must reduce the number of teachers by one in August 2008, this year's expected increase in pupils will mean that the school will be entitled to appoint a teacher in September 2009.  It is absurd that the school will lose a teacher because of the number of pupils in the school on 30 September last year, yet class sizes are projected to go up in the current year.  The school will have more pupils and one fewer teacher to teach them.  The suppression of this post will have serious repercussions for the school.  Not only will the school lose a teacher with a wealth of experience and expertise in the area of special education, it will be forced to replace her with a teacher who has responsibility for a mainstream class.  The obvious knock-on effect will be larger classes.  I urge the Minister to review the decision and not reduce the number of teachers in Rathcormac national school.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">It makes no economic sense to fire a teacher in August 2008 and reappoint another teacher in September 2009.  A little flexibility and common sense is required in the case of Rathcormac national school.  The educational needs of the pupils of this country demand that the Fianna Fáil-led Government should honour its commitment in all aspects of primary education.  It must increase capitation grants and it should preserve the capital investment programme and reinstate the summer works scheme.  Otherwise, parents will be driven back to endless local fundraising to ensure the best education for their children. These steps are essential requirements so that teachers are provided with the best possible circumstances within which to deliver a first-class primary education to the young people.  I ask the Minister to intervene in the Rathcormac national school situation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_700">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion because this time last year the Government made serious commitments on class sizes and at every single door on which Members knocked they witnessed frustration and fury from parents and teachers.  On foot of that campaign, commitments were given and promises were made, and while they were not to the desired extent, they were realistic and achievable but now they have been reneged on.  People believed those promises notwithstanding the promises of the previous election regarding the pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 for nine year olds, which has gone up.  The most recent commitment has been reneged on and since the budget we know that the class size commitment will not be met.  What disturbs me is that there is no intention of meeting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">There is a simultaneous clampdown in the school building programme.  One cannot increase the number of teachers if rooms are not provided.  The Government clearly intends to provide neither teachers nor rooms, which go hand in hand.  It is one thing to teach many pupils in a modern, bright, airy, purpose-built classroom but it is another matter to teach the same number in a dilapidated, cramped, isolated prefab.  The outcome for children must be sub-optimal.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">In my constituency, schools await accommodation for the class sizes they have at present, never mind the promised smaller classes.  When Deputies, as public representatives, ask a question about the status of the school on the waiting list we get the same inane answer, that the matter is being considered on an ongoing basis in the context of a multi-annual programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">That is nonsense and it means nothing.  It is utterly frustrating for schools.  Recently, the answers have become more frustrating, referring to the economic climate, budgetary constraints and the need for responsible spending.  The suggestion seems to be that looking for spending and classrooms for children is somehow profligate and irresponsible and that we are feckless spendthrifts to suggest it.  If the Government thinks spending on education is feckless, there is no hope for the future.  This spending is vital investment in our future productive stream and is precisely the kind of investment our new Taoiseach said would be given priority in the new economic climate.  We have less money but what could be more important use than spending money on our children?  As parents, no matter how hard times get and how little money we have, we prioritise our children and expect the Government to do the same.  It is shameful and short-sighted to do anything less.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">In St. Colmcille's, Knocklyon, one of the biggest schools in the country is about to lose a teacher in September.  Some 500 children are taught in prefabs that are so old and dilapidated that their condition cannot even be maintained.  I thought about the terrible conditions of the hedge schools of old but they did not have the class sizes of today nor the challenges teachers must face today.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">In Divine Word, Rathfarnham, there are three sets of isolated prefabs with no commitment to build although one was given before the election.  Now, three junior infants classes must be merged with two senior infants classes.  This is taking place all over the constituency.  So much for a reduced pupil-teacher ratio — the opposite is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The situation is outrageous at Our Lady's Grove.  It got the go-ahead through the stages of planning, up to having planning permission, but now it is told the project cannot go to tender.  Two teachers who retired from the school recently spent their entire teaching careers in pre-fabs.  The conditions of these schools are sub-optimal from a learning point of view.  Even if the promise to decrease the pupil-teacher ratio was to be kept, they have no meeting rooms or, in many cases, PE facilities.  Cloakrooms and toilets are being converted to facilitate meetings, breaks and special needs supports.  Small prefabs are being partitioned off into even smaller inadequate spaces.  This is the stuff of the Third World.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Holy Trinity national primary school in Stepaside, a newly developing area in my constituency, is now entering its fourth year in prefabs.  It has spent more than €1 million already on prefabs and site works for prefabs.  This is money down the drain.  Parents will not commit to a school that has not received a commitment in regard to a school building and has been told not to apply for planning permission.</p>

I accept this is not the Minister's fault but I hope he will correct it.  The Minister has inherited a false promise from his predecessor, former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, who two weeks before the last general election gave a commitment to reduce class sizes, thus hoodwinking many voters and saving Fianna Fáil many seats that it would otherwise have lost.  However, she has paid the price and been moved sideways to other pastures. The electorate will have its chance for revenge in the local elections next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In a time of economic contraction, it is the Minister's job to protect the interests of our school-going children.  If he were to amend the order and allow these 40 schools to at least maintain the <i>status quo,</i> he would be doing his job.  Just over three hours ago I was contacted about Scoil Mhuire national school in Schull which was informed today that it will lose a teacher in September, reducing it from a five teacher to a four teacher school with one class now having 35 children.  This makes a mockery of the Minister’s so-called target of 28:1.  I will raise this specific issue with the Minister at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">It is bad enough that the Department makes school principals and boards jump through bureaucratic cartwheels for years to get school building projects moved on to the next stage of a shaky rope ladder to which they will have to hang on until it is approved at some unknown date in the future.  I will come back to this subject another day when I will look for definite commitments in respect of a number of schools building projects in Cork South-West that have been lost in the pipeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">It is nothing short of a disgrace, with schools in Cork South-West already suffering from a lack of funding and overcrowding, that Our Lady of Mercy School in Bantry and Scoil Mhuire national school, Schull, have been ordered to let go another teacher.  I ask that the Minister maintain the <i>status quo</i> and allow these 40 teachers to remain in the classroom, teaching our children, and that he keep his promise to reduce the ratio by one more next year.</p>

Then I was.  Now I ain't again."  The Minister should not let this be his epitaph.  If the Deputies opposite vote down this motion and force the schools in Bantry and Schull to sack a teacher, then I will have to agree with Voltaire that common sense is not so common.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">I will get to the point.  I thank and commend my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on bringing forward this motion.  I represent Kerry South and wish tonight to speak on behalf of Scoil Mhuire in Killorglin which has 378 pupils and 14 teachers, a ratio of 27:1.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Like my colleagues, I too was out canvassing during the last general election when we were told that the Government would, during the following three years, reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 24:1.  Teachers and parents believed this, which made our work harder.  I am not shocked that Fianna Fáil has again broken its promise.  It is more of the same.  My colleagues are shocked by this, but I am not because it has happened so many times.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">If Scoil Mhuire, Killorglin, loses a teacher, the ratio will automatically increase to 29:1, which is an absolute disgrace.  The Government's promise may have been aspirational but one would expect it to at least maintain the <i>status quo</i> this year and to try to reduce the ratio nextyear.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">I wish to speak specifically on behalf of Scoil Eoin, Balloonagh, Tralee.  I have raised several times in this House the issue of accommodation at this school.  A solemn promise in respect of a new school given prior to the last election by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, has not been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Scoil Eoin will lose a teacher next September based on its enrolment figures as of 30 September last.  The school had at that time 367 pupils on its roll book, but by November it had 378 pupils, an increase of 11 pupils which would have allowed the school to retain that teacher.  Broken promises aside, perhaps the Minister will agree to have his Department examine the reference date in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">If Fianna Fáil had kept its promise made during the last general election to provide 4,000 extra teachers, thereby reducing the pupil-teacher ratio over four years, Scoil Eoin would have retained its teacher.  Whatever about the con job perpetrated in 2002 on the Irish people, teachers, the INTO, pupils and parents, the con job in the last election is unforgivable.  This is the bottom line.  It is amazing how the INTO, teachers and everybody else accepted the Government's bona fides on the 2002 promise, but to be caught again is inexplicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Will the Minister consider the reference date of 30 September?  It is grossly unfair that a school where children arrive in the month following the opening in September, which they do, is penalised the following year.  The Minister and I are teachers and we know full well that every child in the country must go through the primary school system.  It is the only aspect of the education system that is equal.  We spend less on it than we do on secondary and post-primary education.  All that should be done is that it gets a fair deal like all the other sectors of the education system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_755">I am glad to set out for the House my commitment and that of the Government to the provision of teaching resources to primary schools.  This is being done as part of our overall investment in education which has increased significantly in recent years by more than 70% since 2002 to more than €9.3 billion this year.  This represents a significant increase of more than €690 million, or 8%, on the funding position after budget 2007 and will enable us to consolidate the major service and funding improvements put in place in recent years and to make further progress in a wide range of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Ultimately, this investment is about improving outcomes for our learners whether in schools, colleges or non-formal settings.  The specific issue before the House on reductions to class sizes in primary schools is important in its own right.  Nonetheless, it is but one policy instrument among many by which we are trying to ensure learning outcomes that enable the individual child or student to achieve his or her full potential and participate to the fullest extent possible in society. The €9.3 billion being provided for education this year will enable us to deliver significantly on a number of fronts by investing almost €600 million in school buildings, by bringing expenditure on special education to twice the 2004 amount, through putting additional teachers and special needs assistants in place in primary and post-primary schools and by providing €4.6 billion, or €380 million extra, for teacher pay and pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I will now discuss the specific issue of class size.  The programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position on the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4,000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The programme also sets out how improvements in class size in primary schools will be brought about by changes to the staffing schedule that is used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools based on the total enrolment in the school.  The schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils.  The programme for Government sets a revised basis for the 2010-11 school year of an allocation based on an average of 24 pupils to a class and this will be achieved on a gradual basis by a series of annual reductions of one point on the schedule.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">While the schedule allocates on the basis of an average, each individual school decides how to arrange its classes.  This means that two different schools with the same enrolment and allocated the same number of teachers may choose to configure their classes differently.  Depending on a school's own circumstances one school may aim for an even distribution across all class groups while another school may chose to have lower numbers in a particular class group or groups with consequently larger numbers in other classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">In any discussion on class size and classes where the number of pupils exceeds the average, it is important to understand how the main staffing schedule sets out to treat schools in like circumstances in a fair and consistent manner.  As I stated, the current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and the fact that schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups.  With more than 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">Of course it is the case that some schools can have class sizes of greater than 27 but, as I pointed out, this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">We in this House are aware that the mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  In any year, not just this year, when enrolments are falling in a school this can result in the loss of a teacher.  Equally, when enrolments increase a school can gain a teacher under the operation of the staffing schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">While approximately 120 schools will lose a teacher in the next school year compared to this year, there will still be a net increase of approximately 500 teachers.  The reason for this is that five times as many schools are expected to employ an additional teacher due to an increase in enrolments.  An important consideration with regard to the staffing allocations for schools is that schools should be treated in an equitable manner.  The staffing schedule should operate in a manner that treats schools in like circumstances equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I am aware that the Opposition has put a particular focus on those schools that will lose a teacher in the coming year simply because the total enrolment at the school on which the teacher allocation is based is one pupil fewer.  Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule, it is a fact of life that a single pupil change in enrolment can cause a school to lose or gain a teacher.  In recent years, when improvements were being made to the staffing schedule it was also the case that there were winners and losers depending on individual enrolment profiles.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">It is opportunistic of Deputies on the benches opposite to argue for special treatment for some schools.</p>

This was a substantial additional investment, given the economic environment on which the budget was based.  The allocation provides for pay increases to all teachers but, critically, it will also fund more than 2,000 additional primary teachers, more than the number in schools when the Government took office less than a year ago.</p>

In making choices within available resources, these were the correct choices to make in terms of our priorities.  However, in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4,000 additional teachers over the five-year life of the programme for Government, we have gone well down that road in a short time.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is also provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure and an excess of five over the appointment figure for the post in question.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  Up to the 2006-07 school year the specified figure to attain the post was either 25 or 30, depending on the size of the school.  In the 2006-07 school year the specified figure was changed to 25 for all schools.  An improvement in the arrangements for the allocation of developing school posts to smaller schools, that is, schools with a mainstream staffing of principal plus six mainstream class teachers or fewer, was made this year.  In the case of these schools, the required stipulated increase in enrolments was reduced from 25 to 15.  These supports reduce the threshold for getting a developing school post so as to help schools experiencing large increases in enrolments each year.  More than 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007-08 school year compared with 280 in 2006-07.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">In addition to the supports provided in the classroom, additional resources, including teaching resources, are also provided to cater for the needs of pupils with special educational needs.  I intend to build on the progress made in recent years, which has resulted in a huge increase in resources for special education.  Since 2004 investment in this area has doubled to €900 million and significant progress has been made.  Almost 6,000 additional teachers and SNAs have been put in place mostly at primary level, bringing the total number of special education staff to approximately 19,000.  The training available to teachers has improved significantly.  All schools have been assigned learning support resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures and the application process for additional supports has been transformed for the better with the establishment of the NCSE and its team of more than 80 local special educational needs organisers.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">There has been a particular focus in recent years on improving services for children with autism.  In the past year alone, approximately 100 additional special classes for autistic children were set up, bringing the total number to almost 280.  In addition, my Department has also, in consultation with educational interests, developed a model of general teacher allocation for pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia.  This model was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.  The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.  There are a number of advantages to using a general allocation model.  First, it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments.  Second, it ensures that children can be given help at a much earlier stage as the resource will already be in the school.  Third, it gives schools more certainty about their resource levels.  Finally, inclusion is the desire of the vast majority of parents and my Department is providing the necessary supports in schools throughout the country to facilitate this wherever possible.  There are four special schools among the list of schools that are planned to open in September.  How am I doing on time?</p>

          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_828">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the amendment tonight.  At the outset, I welcome the appointment of my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, an appointment I believe is long overdue.  I have no doubt that he will leave his mark in a very positive fashion during his tenure as Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">In particular, since he comes from a rural constituency and represents rural people and schools, I welcome the fact that the Minister attended a rural primary school.  I hope and appeal to him to ensure that we can continue investment in our rural schools over the coming years.  That is very important.  We have needs to meet in urban centres but, equally, we have needs to meet in rural centres throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Unfortunately, because of the economic situation, we saw a situation whereby the summer works scheme and the devolved grants scheme had to be abandoned, for want of a better word.  Both of the schemes were very positive and of huge importance to rural schools to improve accommodation.  It is very important that we continue to improve accommodation throughout the country, particularly in our rural schools.  I thank the Minister for visiting my constituency last weekend.  We have a very serious problem with accommodation in Kilfinnan national school.  I again appeal to the Minister to make every effort to ensure that this problem can be overcome in the shortest possible space of time because the people have been patient and need to have their project moved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">It is fair to say that any of us who find ourselves in a tight economic situation are faced with priorities.  I will be honest.  I do not want to be confrontational but it is important to be honest when we have debates such as this.  All of us have to make priorities when the resources which were there in previous years are not there.  It is very easy to govern and be a good Minister and all things to all people when one has plenty of money and resources.  Unfortunately, the Minister has found himself in a situation whereby those resources are not as plentiful as they were in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Government has decided to make priorities.  I welcomed the commitment in the programme for Government to continue the reduction in class sizes.  It is an important aspect of ensuring that we improve our education system because overcrowding in classes is not good for teachers, pupils or anybody.  We must be honest and say that we cannot always live in ideal situations or in the ideal world.  While that aspect needs to be addressed, and the Minister is on record tonight as saying that it will be addressed during the lifetime of the Government, I will roll back five or six years to when a similar downturn in the economy occurred in the days when Charlie McCreevy was Minister for Finance and each Department had to curtail its spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Despite that, during the five years of the last programme for Government, the Government managed to deliver on all promises made.  I am very proud of that fact and have no doubt that during the five years of this Government's lifetime, it will continue and deliver on the promises made, be they in education or in any other Department.  I am quite confident that this will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Again, I appeal for honesty from the other side of the House.  When Fianna Fáil set out its election manifesto prior to the last general election, at all times, the Taoiseach or any Minister or Member who spoke stated that what was in that manifesto or what would be in the programme for Government would be dependent on the economic position of the day.  On the Opposition benches, Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and others rightly said the very same thing.  They said they would put their priorities in a manifesto initially and, if elected, in a programme for Government.  One then looks at the economic situation and is honest with the people.  One tells them that we do not have enough money and must prioritise and that we would love to deliver upon what we have promised and will do so when times get better.  That is exactly what the Minister and Government are saying.  It is important to recognise that because it is no different for any other party.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Reference was made to the retention figure.  It is also important to be honest and acknowledge that this figure is agreed by all the partners in education.  It is important to point out that it was not a figure that the Minister, his predecessor, Deputy Mary Hanafin, or anybody else plucked out of the sky and decided that this was going to be the cut-off point.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The September date has been mentioned.  Perhaps it is wrong or unfair.  I do not know.  Again, this is the agreed date.  Of course, it seems cynical.  One takes a teacher out in the month of September and the numbers go up again the following year when a teacher, perhaps a different teacher, goes back in.  That is the biggest issue I have with that because, obviously, teachers might have to leave one school and take up a post in another school and it might be discommoding for them.  That is being honest about the situation.  It is very important to recognise that this date is agreed by all the partners involved in education.  Trade unions and everybody else who has an input has agreed that.  One must have a cut-off point.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I acknowledge that we have had serious and unprecedented investment in education over the past number of years and why not when we could afford it?  We all go on record as saying that if we do not have the good and solid foundation of a good education for our children starting at primary schools, we have nothing.  I am quite proud of the record of Fianna Fáil-led Governments over the past number of years.  When the resources were there, they were spent and were not spared across all the different aspects of education, from primary schools to second and third level education and onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">Tonight, the issue is about class sizes and primary schools and I respect that.  I would love it if the Government was in a position financially to say that it could honour its commitment.  We honoured our commitment in 2007-08 and I have no doubt that when things take a turn for the better financially, we will go on to honour our commitments next year and in future years.  At the end of those five years of Government, people can stand up and say that the Government did not implement what was in the programme for Government over the lifetime of the Government and I will accept that.  What I cannot accept are accusations being made that this did not happen in the first, second and third years.  It is not so long ago that allegations were made with regard to a promise in a previous programme for Government to increase the number of gardaí on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">It is fair to say that after five years in Government, that commitment was met.  We were accused in years one, two, three and four that we were not doing it but it was done by the end of the five years.  I hope and feel confident, given what the Minister has said, that he will be totally committed to improving every aspect of education.  It must be balanced between rural and urban schools.  We must take account of the schools that need temporary accommodation immediately, which is as important as any class size.  For the school that needs permanent accommodation, that need is as important as any class size.  There are schools with other needs, which have their own priorities and it is important that the Minister recognises those priorities in the context of the limited resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">We can drive on forward, together, ensuring balance between rural and urban, between adequate accommodation and optimal class sizes, as well as meeting the needs of our special needs children, in which this Government has a very proud record in recent years.  More must be done, of course.  I accept that fully, but the points I have just made are relevant.  We must have balance in what we do.  I fully support the Minister and am confident that he will deliver on class sizes, accommodation and the other aspects, when the necessary resources are available.</p>

        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_377">
          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_841">I wish to share time with Deputies Ciarán Lynch, Martin Ferris and Ruairí Quinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I am absolutely flabbergasted at the nerve on the Government side of the House, that Deputies can stand up here and go back on a very clear promise that was made in the programme for Government.  That promise does not refer to what the Government "might" do, but to what it "will" do and reads: "The staffing schedule will be reduced from a general rule of at least one teacher for every 27 pupils in 2007/08, by one point a year, to one for every 24 children by 2010/11."  That is a definite commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio this year by one point but the Government Deputies stand up and tell us they are not doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I was in this House on many occasions when the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, defended the fact that the Government did not fulfil the previous commitment in the programme for Government either.  That commitment was that all children under the age of nine would be in classes of 20:1 or less.  She said she could not do it then, in times of plenty.  Now we are being told that it cannot be done because the money is not available.  These are two broken promises by the Government to the children of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">I note the Public Gallery is full and I presume most of those listening to this debate are involved in schools in some capacity, whether as teachers or parents.  I am sure they must be as flabbergasted as I am at the nerve of the Government.  I do not blame the current Minister but the Government as a whole.  It is unbelievable that they would come in here and say what they have said.  I include the Green Party Deputies in my criticisms.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">The Green Party claimed that it was prioritising education.  I listened to Deputy Paul Gogarty more than 100 times claiming that his party was prioritising education but there is no Green Party Deputy here tonight.  It is disgraceful to renege on these promises and to tell the children of this country that they should tell the truth while Government Deputies come into this Chamber, in good times and not so good times, and renege on a specific promise to them.  It is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">In the limited time available I wish to refer to the school in my constituency that is listed in the motion, namely, the JFK Memorial School, which I visited this morning and on a number of previous occasions.  The school was one child short at the cut-off date at the end of September.  The school now has that additional child, who moved from the north west of the country.  If the promise had not been made by the Government, that child could have moved to the school a week earlier to ensure that the school would retain its teacher.  The school believed the promise and had the numbers that it thought it would need to keep the teacher at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">A number of other schools listed here are in the same situation.  Those schools, at least, should be allowed to retain their teacher.  In all good faith, they thought they had the numbers to do so.  They believed the Government of this country and those that were elected to govern and understood they could keep their teacher.  It was the Government which broke its word; the schools did nothing wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I know the negative effect this will have on the school in my constituency.  Indeed,  all Deputies know the effect it will have.  We have the second highest average class size in a long list of European Union countries.  The only country that is worse than us is the United Kingdom and we do not want to take example from it.  Let us imagine what it is like, for example, to be a child with special needs, most of whom are being mainstreamed now, a quiet child sitting at the back of the class trying to get attention or to be a teacher trying to cope with all of the different needs in a classroom with the size of the classes we have in this country.  We still have a very large number of children in classes of more than 30 and some in classes of more than 35.  That small children, who so need to get a good start, should be subjected to that, is appalling.  The Government claims it is committed to education but reneges on a promise to children at the very time when they need individual attention — in the early years of their school lives.  The Government Deputies blithely pronounce that they have priorities.  What could be more of a priority than the small children in primary schools in this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Many Deputies attended meetings in schools before the general election.  I attended numerous such meetings because I was my party's education spokesperson at the time.  There were three Private Members' motions in the House on class sizes in the space of a couple of years.  We all know how important an issue it is.  We heard the promises and saw rooms packed full.  Parents, because they know how important it is, made the effort to attend the meetings.  Our party gave commitments on reducing class sizes and on the need for 4,000 more teachers and we did the sums.  We stood by our promise and intended to implement it if we were in Government.  I cannot understand how people can vote for the parties in Government after two broken promises on one of the most important issues, namely, the chance we give our young people in our schools.  Once again, I find it absolutely mind boggling.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I commend Deputy Brian Hayes for tabling this motion and share his concerns about the entire primary sector.  Many of those involved in that sector are listening to the debate in the House tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Prior to last year's general election, I attended a meeting in Cork, which the current Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe also attended.  More than 1,600 parents turned up to that meeting which was on classroom sizes.  One of the things that stuck in my mind that night was how badly Ireland rates in comparison to other countries in the OECD and the EU.  Our pupil-teacher ratios, despite having one of the best GDPs and GNPs in Europe, place us as the bottom of the list.  Even the 27:1 ratio referred to in the programme for Government reflects an absence of ambition on the issue of classroom size.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">The Minister spoke about how this decision will allow him to transfer funds from one area of primary school education to others, such as special needs.  This is nothing short of robbing Peter to pay Paul in what is the Cinderella of the education sector.  The Minister knows that primary school education, when compared to second and third level, has the least amount of investment per head.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The three schools in my constituency that are affected by this decision are Christ King Mon in Turners Cross, SN Barra Naofa Buachaillí in Beaumont and St. Columba's Boys NS in Douglas.  I spoke to the three principals of those schools about the four teachers they will lose as a result of the Department's announcement.  They provided the solution to the problem themselves.  They suggested that we should return to the situation where the retention figure and the appointment figure had balance and flexibility built in that allowed for a sustainable and measurable approach.  What we have now is a guillotine that comes into effect and removes a teacher immediately but the enrolment shortfall may be rectified by the following year's enrolments.  That is a very blunt instrument to use but the problem is correctable.  Even if one was only to stick to the Minister's ratio aspirations, if we had flexibility built in the problems caused by this blunt instrument could be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">A number of the schools affected have been providing an educational service for decades, with an expertise and experience that has come from working in their communities over a protracted period.  Some of those communities are going through a process of regeneration.  The last thing we should be doing is sending a signal from this House that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If a school loses a teacher, the word on the street is that this school is in decline.  Parents will stop sending their children to that school.  One of the reasons young people return to communities such as Turner's Cross and other such communities, which have been in existence for 40 or 50 years, is the existence of a successful school.  I remind the House that the boys' school in Turner's Cross,  one of the schools that will suffer the loss of a teacher, was once attended by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, a former Minister for Education and Science.  That makes a statement in this respect.</p>

          <p eId="para_857">There is no strategic sense to what is being proposed by the Minister.  It will create greater class sizes or has the potential to create combined classes.  Do we want to return to the practice of fourth and fifth classes being taught side by side, given that teachers find it difficult enough to teach one big class without having to teach two different curriculums at the same time?</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The Minister will save €2 million by this measure.  When one considers the size of his Department's budget, one must ask why he is creating such a major difficulty over €2 million.  The cost of overcrowded classes is not measured in terms of €2 million or even in terms of bricks and mortar.  I worked as an adult literacy organiser for 20 years.  During that time I saw the cost involved for people later in life if primary education is not properly delivered.  The true cost is far greater than the figure of €2 million.  The cost involved when children are deprived of all types of opportunities and educational attainment, which the rest of us take for granted, is far greater than any sum of money.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_859">Despite Government commitments to reduce class sizes, more than a quarter of all pupils in primary schools are still in classes where the number of pupils exceeds 30.  That accounts for more than 100,000 children.  This State has the second largest class size at primary level in the EU.  The corresponding figure for Kerry in 2007 was 21%.  When one compares this economy, which has enjoyed unprecedented economic growth and wealth during the past 15 years, to that of a Third World economy such as Cuba, one must note that its target class size of 15 pupils is almost met in most cases.  The benefits of such a class size to a child in terms of education cannot be more striking than in Cuba.  The fact that we cannot reach that target or even a class size of under 30 pupils is an indictment of how money is being spent in this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Funding for primary education here also lags behind other member states of the EU, being only 70% of the EU average.  According to recent surveys, eight out of ten schools fundraise to meet their daily running costs.  Many schools find that Government funding covers only 50% of the school's basic costs.  I doubt if there is a Deputy in this House who is not involved in helping boards of management or parents to raise funds for their respective primary schools.  That is not right.  Given economic growth, it is shameful that parents, pupils and teachers must collect money to meet the running costs of schools.  It is an indictment on the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Because of these problems and parents' concerns regarding primary schooling, we witness parents queuing up with their infants to secure places in a school which they believe will cater for them.  However, even that is no insurance, as we witnessed last year where demographic changes meant that schools in certain areas were unable to cope with the demands placed upon them.  This is especially the case in growing urban centres coping with the pressure of development where there is a lack of proper infrastructure to provide schools and allocate teachers.  In recent years this pressure has been added to by the increase in the number of non-nationals or immigrants — the new Irish, as we call them.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">With primary school pupil figures expected to climb to 500,000 by the end of 2009, the Government needs to treat as a matter of urgency the issue of class sizes.  The current scenario of pupils being taught permanently in prefabs, which occupy school yard space, in class rooms that are run down, in converted toilets and PE halls — or having to travel miles to a school with adequate space — is completely unacceptable.  According to a recent reply to a parliamentary question by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, she was not even aware of the number of schools currently using prefabs.  I urge the Minister to make such statistics available.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">A number of years ago the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, published a list of all school buildings which included priority ratings and indicative dates for construction.  This allowed schools to track the progress of their applications, but now no indication is given in this respect.  Many of us are all too familiar with that, given the number of questions tabled to the Minister requesting such information.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">We are also aware that the issue in this motion is addressed daily.  Two of the schools listed in the motion, Scoil Eoin in Tralee and Scoil Mhuire in Killorglin, are in my county, the former being in the constituency of Kerry North.  Unfortunately, they are not the only primary schools facing this and other problems.  I recall debates prior to the 2002 general election when all sorts of promises were made.  Prior to the general election last year, in debates on school facilities, allocation of teachers and calls for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, all sorts of promises were again made, but they have been reneged upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">Scoil Eoin was referred to in the north Kerry area plan drawn up last year by the Commission on School Accommodation.  It was noted that while the school was very carefully maintained, 54% of pupils were accommodated in prefabricated buildings that were 20 years old, while 24% of pupils were accommodated in a building constructed 46 years ago which had not been modernised.  A further 22% of pupils were accommodated in a building that was 86 years old, and part of it was 116 years old, which had not been modernised.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">With the projected steady increase in the number of pupils seeking places in this school, something needs to be done urgently to address the situation.  Scoil Eoin has the largest number of primary pupils in the County Kerry.  The loss of a teacher in any school causes great difficulties on many levels and in large towns these challenges are multiplied.  The system of judging class sizes based on enrolment on 30 September is grossly misrepresentative of the true picture.  Scoil Eoin had 567 pupils enrolled on 30 September 2007, but by November 2007, only six weeks later, the number of pupils had increased to 578.  Such increases in enrolments are replicated throughout the country, with more pupils being enrolled after 30 September.  The cut-off date of 30 September has a major impact on schools, because the number enrolled can drastically increase in a short period following that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">A similar urgency attaches to the addressing of accommodation needs in Scoil Mhuire, Tralee Educate Together and other schools in Ballybunion, Listowel, Tarbert, Ballylongford and elsewhere in the north of the county.  Many of the problems relate to the perceived lack of future capacity of schools to cope with increased numbers.  Adequate staffing levels are a crucial element.  One of the schools referred to in the report, the O'Brennan national School in Ballymacelligott, found itself in the ridiculous position last year of paying €1,200 per month to hire prefabs because of the delay in initiating renovation and reconstruction of the school.  Such expenditure is replicated in many other schools.  School authorities pay out such dead money when it should be invested in putting a proper structure in place which would resolve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">There are ongoing problems with the building of a national school in Blennerville, which is a disgrace.  Prior to the general election last year the headlines in the local newspapers read "Fianna Fáil deliver", "Money allocated to build new school in Blennerville", "Site located" and so forth.  Elected representatives were invited to a meeting a number of weeks ago, attended by the parents, teachers and everybody else in the area with an interest in the issue.  At the meeting, the audience was told quite categorically that the issue was not on the immediate agenda.  People were hugely disappointed as a result.  Three Fianna Fáil county councillors at the meeting said they were both embarrassed and ashamed by the Government's actions with regard to building the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I urge the Minister to revisit all the promises made before the election and to live up to the responsibility to provide proper facilities and an adequate number of teachers to provide education to our children.  Money could not be better spent than on education.  The lower the pupil-teacher ratio, the better the attention for both teacher and pupils.  Proper facilities should be a given.  We should not have to stand here begging the Government to invest in our children's future.  With money in the coffers of the Exchequer, there is no excuse for the failure of this and previous Governments to meet this need.  It is a disgrace.  I hope this Minister will take a hands-on approach, unlike the previous Minister, on the issues I have raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
            <p eId="para_870">I seek the Minister's immediate intervention in the case of Kerry Anne McLoughlin of Glenballythomas, Tulsk, County Roscommon, a 17 year old girl who has been attending UCHG for the past seven years with a thyroid problem and who is still awaiting an appointment for treatment in St. Luke's following the removal of a malignant tumour last July.  I have tried to raise this matter on the Adjournment on several occasions and I am delighted it is being heard tonight.  It is a frustrating and serious matter which should have been dealt with long before now.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In 2004 a scan showed a growth on Kerry Anne's thyroid gland and a repeat scan in 2006 showed the growth had doubled in size.  Surgery was eventually arranged for July 2007, when one part of the thyroid was removed.  Unfortunately, the result showed there was a malignant tumour on the thyroid gland and the patient received an urgent phone call from UCHG to say more surgery was necessary.  Further surgery was carried out and it showed there was cancer of the thyroid gland with total invasion.  Radio iodine ablation treatment was necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">This young girl was put on the waiting list for St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin and for St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London.  In November 2007, UCHG told the family Kerry Anne would receive treatment in St. Bartholomew's Hospital in eight weeks' time.  The family was delighted with this breakthrough and waited patiently for two months for the call.  The then worried and concerned parents rang the hospital to inquire about the commencement date of the treatment, but were told her name had been removed from the list.  Some weeks later the family contacted St. Luke's only to be told her name was not on the waiting list there.  When they contacted UCHG, they were told her name had been removed from the St. Luke's list because she was supposed to go to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.  This situation is the worst cock-up I have seen in my time in political office.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Following this, Mrs. McLoughlin made a phone call to UCHG in which she could not hide her anger and frustration at the way she and her daughter had been treated by hospital authorities, particularly by someone whom I will not mention but who is on the Minister's list and who was responsible for handling this case following surgery by Mr. Quill.  Following her cry for help to St. Luke's, an appointment for Kerry Anne was arranged the following day.  However, she was informed that owing to the long waiting list in St. Luke's, she will not be reached until after September, but before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The distraught family has contacted a hospital in Belfast in desperation.  The head of department there listened to the nightmare story of how this 17 year old girl's life has been put at risk owing to the lack of services.  A shocked consultant has promised to intervene and, hopefully, provide help.  However, he is not able to provide the family with a definite appointment date at such short notice.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">This girl has lost a serious amount of weight, suffers from anaemia and lies in bed most of the day with no energy.  She is unable to attend school and mix with her friends and feels that nobody cares about her.  So much for our cancer strategy of early detection and treatment and our promise that cancer prevention is of utmost importance.  This girl was told in UCHG that if one was to get cancer, her type of cancer is the best type to get.  This is not a great consolation for a 17 year old girl.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The family has decided to make one last plea for help.  Before they go public with the heart-breaking story of this 17 year teenager, I implore the Minister to make an early and positive intervention in this sad case.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_877">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">As the Deputy will be aware, the organisation and management of the health services is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has advised the Department of Health and Children that in November 2007 the individual was referred to St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  Owing to the substantial waiting list for specialist radio iodine ablation treatment at that time, the medical team in University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, cancelled the appointment with a view to referring the individual to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London.  The HSE has further advised the Department that this referral was not followed through by staff in UCHG due to an administrative error.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The individual was again referred by her consultant to St. Luke's Hospital on 11 March 2008.  Scans have been arranged for 28 and 31 July and the individual will be admitted for treatment during the week of 10 August.  The HSE would like to apologise to the individual and her family for the distress caused by the prolonged delay in her treatment as a result of a breakdown in the referral process.  The HSE will also make every effort to get an earlier appointment for the individual with the consent of her referring clinician.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The Department has sought and received assurances from Professor Tom Keane, director of the HSE national cancer control programme, that efforts are being made to ensure acceptable clinical waiting times for patients requiring radio isotope treatment.  Professor Keane has already made significant progress in delivery of the programme to ensure equity of access to services and equality of outcome irrespective of geography.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">Last February, we raised this issue of gynaecological services in Cork.  On that occasion, the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, was acting on behalf of the Minister, who incidentally is not in the House this evening.  She stated in her response that it was planned that some minor surgical procedures would be carried out at the Cork University Hospital on a trial basis on Thursday, 27 March, with the aim of expanding the gynaecology service from the first week in April.  She stated the ultimate aim was to have the gynaecological theatre open on a five-day per week basis.  She claimed these developments indicated that gynaecological services continued to be improved in Cork University Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">That was three months ago, but no improvement has taken place.  Waiting times for Cork women in need of urgent gynaecological investigations are set to remain as health officials continue to renege on promised services and the Minister fails to deliver on her commitment.  This is despite the warning from general practitioners in Cork that women's lives are being put at risk by the wholly inadequate gynaecological service based at a maternity facility that cost €75 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The doctors, members of the Cork city branch of the Irish College of General Practitioners, have described the situation as a disaster waiting to happen.  Cork women over the age of 50 with suspected cancer of the womb have been forced to wait for months for crucial investigations, due to what has been described as underfunding in the service.  These are women who could be treated in a morning.  Two of the three operating theatres are closed and women with cancer will be told they cannot be examined.  This is a diabolical state of affairs.  A hospital in which €75 million has been spent on developing state-of-the-art gynaecological facilities has two of these facilities closed.  This is because the HSE has failed to put staff in place due to a recruitment embargo by the Minister for Health and Children.  I would like the Minister of State to inform the House this evening when the doors to these facilities will open and services will be put in place.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_389">
            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_886">I thank Deputy Ciarán Lynch for sharing time.  When this matter was first raised, certain commitments were made.  One commitment was that from September 2007 two of these theatres in Cork University Hospital would be opened on a part-time basis, leading in time to full-time occupancy.  This has not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">There are four operating lists for gynaecology for Cork University Hospital.  A list comprises a half-day of operating.  Of those four lists, two are taken up by two gynaecologists while ten consultants must compete for time in the other two lists.  There is one gynaecologist who specialises in investigation but has a list only every two weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">The lives of women diagnosed with cancer are being put at risk.  The necessary procedures could be carried out immediately.  However, there is no space available at the theatres because the management at Cork University Hospital and HSE South have decided the money is not available to open them.  One theatre could be opened for two days a week but this cannot be done because there are not enough staff to carry out the necessary sterilisation procedures for the theatre.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">I am sure Deputy Harney is still the Minister for Health and Children, despite the fact we have not seen her for some time.  However, she takes no responsibility for this situation.  I am not blaming the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, as he is only here to do a job tonight.  Someone, however, must be responsible.  This is a disaster waiting to happen.  Consultants in Cork University Hospital, dedicated professionals, are in such a plight they are fast becoming disillusioned.  We all buy into the notion that more consultants are needed.  With no operating theatres and no time available, they can only sit around drinking coffee.  If this is what the consultants will have to do, why are we employing more?  The Minister is responsible, despite the fact that she wants to keep the health service at arm's length.  She will eventually be made to confront the women in Cork whose treatment will be protracted.  She is putting women's health and their lives in danger because of these delays.  She should face up to her responsibility and deal with the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_890">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, as she is at another engagement.  In fairness, last week she spent three hours in the House dealing with the cancer strategy on Private Members' business.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">The Government is committed to the provision of high quality gynaecological services across the country, including the Cork region.  There are currently five gynaecology theatre slots per week in Cork University Hospital, amounting to the equivalent of two and a half day's service.  Approximately 1,152 elective gynaecology procedures were carried out there in 2007.  In addition, approximately 17 emergency gynaecological procedures are carried out each month.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">There are three operating theatres in Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, one obstetric and two gynaecological theatres.  The HSE has indicated that the obstetric theatre is fully staffed and the hospital has recently completed the recruitment process for several senior nursing staff for the gynaecology theatres.  In addition, a consultant anaesthetist is being recruited to facilitate the commencement of a gynaecology service in CUMH.  In the interim, gynaecology procedures continue to be carried out in Cork University Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">In March 2008 several minor surgical procedures were carried out in Cork University Maternity Hospital, on a trial basis.  The ultimate aim is to have the gynaecology service operational on a full five-day per week basis.  These developments illustrate that the gynaecological services continue to be improved in Cork University Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The HSE has designated Cork University Hospital as one of two cancer centres in the managed cancer control network for the HSE South.  The decision by the HSE to have four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  Professor Tom Keane took up his position as interim director of the national cancer control programme in November 2007.  Professor Keane will engage in detailed planning to facilitate the progressive, gradual and carefully managed transfer of services between locations over the next two years.  A decision on the location of gynaecological cancer services for the HSE South cancer control network will be made by Professor Keane and the national cancer control programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The development of cancer services and the continuing emphasis on improving cancer care underline the Government's commitment to providing safe and accessible services for patients in the southern region.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_896">The matter I raise was referred to me recently by a concerned constituent.  While he was attending a food and drinks fair in England, he was given a sample of what is termed a "shot pack".  As a father and family man, it would frighten him, and likewise me, if this product were allowed into Ireland without strict controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The shot products are advertised as "shots without glass".  The manner in which the product is promoted indicates it is intended for the teenage market.  The product's brochure claims it has revolutionised the single serve alcohol category by introducing a single shot of premium liquor in a lightweight, durable plastic pouch.  The 50 ml shot comes in a safe, break-resistant plastic pouch which makes it safer than a glass and has built-in spout making it easy to pour no matter where it is taken.  The stand-up pouch, which is sustainable and earth-friendly compared to rigid containers, has a tear feature for an immediate, ready-to-drink shot anywhere.  The brochure claims these shots are perfect for concerts, sporting events, holidays, cruise ships and planes.  It boasts, "You name it, you can take it anywhere" and "No glass to break, no liquor to spill".</p>
            <p eId="para_898">This product of Canadian whiskey has an alcohol proof of 80%.  It can be hidden easily on one's person and brought into a nightclub without observation.  The Minister of State as a publican knows that all liquor sales in the State must be licensed.  I shudder to think what could happen if these products are allowed into this country.  They originate in the United States, Mexico and the Virgin Islands.  They are promoted by an English company.  When I challenged the managing director of the company today, he said they had no products of 80% proof, despite the fact that I had one of them in my hands and he only admitted the fact then.  They are out to increase the vulnerability of young people in this country.  We decry the binge drinking of some teenagers but if this product is allowed in, where will it be sold?  It certainly will not be sold in the usual outlets but rather in the forecourts of petrol stations and other places where there is easy access for young people on their way to the disco.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">The Minister of State has an ideal opportunity to include an amendment in the forthcoming legislation to prevent the sale of these products in Ireland.  The manager of this company said that he is in active and forward negotiations to find an agency for the sale and distribution of this product in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">I refer to the report by Dr. Ann Hope on alcohol-related harm in Ireland.  It lists about 60 instances of the damage done by alcohol.  The report highlights research which found that alcohol affects an adolescent brain differently from the adult brain.  The damage from alcohol used during adolescence can have long-term, irreversible effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">I ask the Minister of State to bring to this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to ensure that something provision will be included in the forthcoming legislation to prevent added misery being heaped on the teenage population of Ireland, as demonstrated by the ease with which these products can be hidden on the person.  Anywhere one goes, these products can go.  We must prevent this situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">I welcome this discussion of the alcohol-related harm which is so prevalent in our society and, in particular, the opportunity to mention the decisive action which the Government is taking to address the problem.  Last year, the Health Research Board published its overview of health-related consequences of problem alcohol use in which it drew attention to the fact that alcohol consumption in Ireland has increased significantly over recent decades.  We have one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the European Union.  In 2006, alcohol consumption levels in this country were about 30% higher than the EU average.  Moreover, we have a particular problem with binge drinking which is far more common here than in other EU countries.  The 2007 Eurobarometer survey found that 34% of Irish drinkers consumed five or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting compared with the EU average of 10%.  When asked about the frequency of consuming five or more drinks on one occasion, 54% of respondents in Ireland stated that they did so at least one a week.  This was the highest figure recorded for any of the countries in the survey.  Ireland emerges with the highest level of binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The health-related consequences of excessive alcohol consumption are by now well known.  They include an increased incidence of accidents, injuries, domestic violence and suicide.  Adverse social and economic consequences include absenteeism and loss of productivity.  I do not need to spell out the impact of excessive alcohol consumption on levels of crime, public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">I wish to detail the decisive action which the Government is taking to combat alcohol-related harm.  The Government alcohol advisory group was established last January last to conduct an urgent examination of the public order aspects of the sale and consumption of alcohol.  It submitted its report on 31 March 2008 which contains 31 recommendations for legislative and other reforms in areas covered by its terms of reference.  On 22 April, the Government approved the drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 which contains proposals for urgent reforms to licensing law and public order legislation in response to certain recommendations in the report.  Both the report and details of the proposed legislation were subsequently published.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 is at an advanced stage and the Minister for Justice, Equality and law Reform intends to present it to the Dáil in the very near future.  With the support of both Houses, he is confident that this legislation can be enacted before the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">On the specific subject matter of this discussion, the product in question appears to be a distilled spirit-based drink, originating in Mexico, Canada and other countries and marketed in lightweight plastic containers.  Each container holds a single serving.  These products have high alcohol content, typically of 35% to 40%, although Deputy Burke said it is close to 80%, which is alarming.  While it is not clear at this stage that they are being promoted specifically with young people in mind, the fact that the containers are light, portable and easy to conceal means that they could be attractive to persons under the age of 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently in contact with the Department of Health and Children about this product and both Departments will explore the possibility of a statutory prohibition or controls on its marketing.  However, where any product is in free circulation within the EU internal market, difficulties arise in prohibiting its circulation and consumption within a single country.  The introduction of specific national controls or regulations is also problematic.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Some Members may recall that a similar problem arose in 2004 with regard to plastic sachets of vodka, known as Bullseye Baggies, which had been placed on the market and which appeared to be directed at young people.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought and obtained the co-operation and agreement of the licensed trade, both the on-trade and off-trade, not to market the product and this strategy proved effective and successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">The Minister would ask the drinks industry and the licensed trade for their support and co-operation in refusing to market and supply the product.  There now is a high level of awareness of the extent of alcohol-related harm in our society and anything that is likely to exacerbate or add to existing problems should be avoided.  I thank Deputy Burke for raising this issue and for providing the opportunity for this discussion.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_395">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_913">I welcome my constituency colleague, Deputy John Moloney, to the Dáil Chamber in his ministerial capacity and I wish him well in health and happiness in that role.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">I wish to address the current situation regarding outstanding warrants and court orders, committal applications and other applications, be they bench warrants or otherwise, that have gone unenforced.  I do not have the exact figures to hand but I ask the Minister of State to provide the House with the up to date and exact figures.  It seems to me there could be up to tens of thousands of bench warrants actively recorded which remain unexecuted.  Many of these are committal applications on foot of court orders lawfully given and granted.  I venture to suggest that among these tens of thousands could be many serious criminal cases which gives rise to questions of public safety where there may be suspects at large.  These may be persons responsible for serious criminal offences who have been ordered to turn up in courts but have failed to do so.  Whether any efforts are being made to track them down to bring them to court, to ensure compliance with the court order, is in doubt.  A couple of years ago, the matter attracted the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General who pointed to gross inefficiencies in the system.  In expressing his concern, he recommended that certain action be taken.  I would like to know what has happened since those remarks were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">Earlier this year, a judge in a case in Donegal struck out an application for a bench warrant when it was discovered that it was over four years old.  The judge felt that justice would not have been done by validating, implementing or executing a warrant which had been outstanding and unenforced for a period of four years.  That is indicative of the type of problem which is bringing the justice system into disrepute.  Is it a question of Garda resources?  Is the Garda properly resourced to deal with these matters?  Is priority being given in Garda districts to deal with such matters?  Are specific officers designated in Garda areas with the responsibility of dealing with these matters?  If it is not a question of Garda manpower or willpower, is there a problem with the computer system or other communications?  Is there a difficulty in executing these warrants because Garda computer equipment is faulty, outdated or in need of review?</p>
            <p eId="para_916">What reforms are in the offing?  Earlier this year, the Fines Bill was listed on the schedule of legislative reform.  That legislation would have the effect of allowing fines to be paid by instalments, as well as improving the means of assessing a person's ability to pay.  If both these measures were introduced it might obviate the need for outstanding bench warrants or unenforced committal orders.  Yet the Fines Bill has been withdrawn by the Government for reasons that have not been properly explained to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">In January this year, there were 35,000 outstanding bench warrants.  How many of those have been executed since?  What improvements have been made to reduce that figure?  If we do not have targeted action to reduce these tens of thousands of outstanding warrants — many of them concerning bail and others concerning serious criminal charges — we are undermining the integrity of the criminal justice system.  By not dealing with these issues, we will also be putting down a direct challenge to the authority of the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State for replying to it.  I hope we can achieve a targeted reduction by way of adopting a strategic approach to this issue.  In that way, by the end of this year, we can perhaps show that we have tackled the problem, thus averting a serious issue which is bringing the law into disrepute.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_396">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_919">I thank Deputy Charles Flanagan for his good wishes and for displaying his usual decency.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that owing to other business he is unable to be here for the debate this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">In any criminal justice system it is inevitable that, at any given time, there will be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution.  It should be borne in mind, too, that the vast majority of the outstanding warrants concern financial penalties, not violent crime.  The Garda Síochána continues to give priority to the enforcement of warrants arising in serious cases.  Apart from the large volume of warrants being issued, there can also be unavoidable reasons why warrants take time to execute or, indeed, prove ultimately unenforceable.  Many individuals are subject to multiple warrants and try to evade Garda attention through moving to different addresses.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">Of its nature, it is difficult to be precise as to what level of outstanding warrants at any point in time represents the optimal situation.  The number of warrants outstanding has to be seen partly from the perspective that the strength of the Garda Síochána is now over 13,800.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The Minister has been informed that the Garda authorities are committed to strengthening the warrants enforcement process.  The Garda Commissioner has raised the issue of the execution of warrants with each regional assistant commissioner.  A range of measures aimed at reducing the number of warrants on hand has been identified and these are being implemented.  The measures include the reassignment of additional gardaí to this function.  The position is being closely monitored by senior Garda management and consideration is also being given, at an organisational level, to further measures to address the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The Minister is also taking a number of steps to deal with this issue.  A particular difficulty is that cases concerning the non-payment of fines clog up the courts system, since gardaí must seek warrants to enforce their payment.  A pilot project was introduced by this Department under which outstanding fines were pursued in terms of debt collection by an outside agency rather than moving directly to the stage where gardaí seek a warrant.  The pilot project suggests that this proved successful as an alternative method of fine collection.  The Department, in consultation with the Garda and the Courts Service, is considering how best to take this forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">There is also a Fines Bill currently before the House.  Among other things, it provides for the payment of fines by instalment and an improved means of assessing the capacity of a person to pay a fine.  These proposals, if implemented, will result in a smaller number of warrants being issued and thus reduce pressure on the warrant system.  The Minister is also examining other legislative measures which might help to improve the efficiency of the fines collection system, particularly by reducing the amount of Garda time dedicated to the warrants process.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The third programme of law reform of the Law Reform Commission has been approved by Government and is now under way.  It includes an examination of the enforcement of court orders and the service of proceedings in both civil and criminal cases, in particular the procedure for the execution of bench warrants and search warrants.  This topic was included because it is recognised that there are significant difficulties in this area at present and that the procedural problems in this area have resulted in an inefficient use of resources.  Based on experience with the Law Reform Commission, which invariably produces reports and recommendations of the highest standard, the work of the commission should prove of immense value in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">The Minister and the Garda Commissioner are aware of the importance of administering an efficient warrants process and will continue to monitor the operation of the system with a view to making whatever changes may be necessary to improve its operation.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_935">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 105, 455, 457, 461 to 463, inclusive, and 478 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">Homelessness involves a complex interplay between personal, economic, social and structural issues and the Government is, therefore, committed to addressing homelessness in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.  Significant progress has been made since the adoption of the Integrated Government Strategy on Homelessness in 2000.  This has resulted in an improvement in both the quality and range of services for homeless persons, leading to a reduction in the number of persons classified as homeless.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">There are a number of streams of funding which support the running costs of homeless services.  My Department is responsible for accommodation and related costs for homeless persons and, under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, recoups 90% of expenditure by local authorities for such purposes.  Funding to local authorities under section 10 has increased significantly in recent years and, in 2008, the provision exceeds €53 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The funding of care-related costs for homeless services is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Discussions have taken place at Ministerial level in relation to the provision of funding by the HSE for the opening or bringing into full operation of certain new homeless facilities and my officials are engaging with the HSE and Department of Health and Children to achieve a satisfactory resolution of the issues involved as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">To underpin future progress on homeless issues, a revised Government strategy on homelessness is being developed by my Department, under the aegis of the Cross Department Team on Homelessness with input from the National Homeless Consultative Committee, which includes representatives of local authorities, the HSE and voluntary bodies.  The work of these groups helps to ensure a full and integrated response to the many needs and issues involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The strategy will aim to eliminate long term occupation of emergency homeless accommodation and the need to sleep rough by 2010, and will also address the prevention of homelessness, where possible.  This builds on the commitments in both the Programme for Government and the social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  It will include specific national and local actions and will be implemented in accordance with timelines for the key objectives set out in the strategy, supported by a specific implementation plan to be put in place following the strategy's publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">I expect the revised strategy to be submitted to Government shortly, with publication to follow as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

The relevant Technical Guidance Document H provides guidance on how to comply with the requirements of Part H and incorporates, inter alia, Irish Standard Recommendation SR:6 of 1991 — Recommendations for Domestic Effluent Treatment and Disposal from a Single Dwelling House, issued by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).  Compliance with the Building Regulations is primarily the responsibility of the builder and the owner of the building while their enforcement is a matter for the 37 local Building Control Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">A new European Standard for small wastewater treatment plants has been introduced and will come into force on 1 July 2009. The need for new systems to comply with this standard, together with recommended performance levels for treatment systems, has been brought to the attention of Local Authorities by Circular Letters from my Department in November 2006 and January 2008 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">I understand that the EPA Code of Practice on Wastewater Treatment Systems, when finalised, will refer to relevant European Standards and that the NSAI propose to withdraw SR6: 1991, in favour of this Code of Practice.

            <p eId="para_950">In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">In working to compile the Register for 2007/8, local authorities undertook and completed, with assistance from my Department, the most extensive registration campaign in decades. On the basis of the work undertaken, I am satisfied that local authorities achieved a significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register compared to previous years. The task now for local authorities, in relation to the Register, is to maintain and build on the progress made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Beyond that, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register. In this regard, I welcome the recent report of the Joint Committee on Environment, Heritage and Local Government in relation to The Future of the Electoral Register in Ireland and Related Matters. The report is consistent with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government to establish an Electoral Commission, and is an important input to future Government decisions in this area.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_954">As announced in my Carbon Budget of 6 December 2007, a fundamental change is being made in the manner in which motor tax is charged for new cars to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to introduce measures to rebalance motor tax in favour of cars with lower CO2 emissions. The Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Act 2008, giving effect to the changes was enacted in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The new motor tax system complements the new CO2 based VRT system which applies to the purchase of a new car and which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Both the new CO2 based motor tax system and VRT systems come into operation on 1 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">Linking the VRT and motor tax rates to CO2 emission levels will mean that those purchasing cleaner, low emission cars will pay less while those opting to purchase higher emitting vehicles will pay more. Both systems apply the same seven bands for determining the taxation class.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">My Department has worked closely with the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Transport and the motor industry to ensure the smooth introduction of the new system.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The websites of both my Department and the Revenue Commissioners include comprehensive information, including questions and answers, on the new motor tax and VRT systems. Information on the new motor tax system has been supplied and is available on motor tax offices websites.  The website of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) has more specific information on the CO2 emissions ratings of individual car makes and models as does the website of Sustainable Energy Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">On a more individual basis, motorists who registered their cars in the first six months of this year will, next month, prior to receipt of the motor tax renewal notice, receive a letter explaining the new system and how it affects their motor tax position.  Many of these owners will be transferred to the new CO2 based system on first renewal of their motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">A key part of both the new CO2 based motor tax and VRT systems will be a new mandatory labelling system for cars based on CO2 emission levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Experience has shown that existing labelling requirements are not sufficiently consumer-friendly, and that an improved design would be beneficial to car buyers. It is my intention to introduce a new information label based on the seven CO2 bands from 1 July. The label will be similar to the energy-rating label which already exists for many consumer electrical goods and which is already familiar to consumers. The label will also include information on fuel efficiency, the amount of motor tax and the applicable rate of vehicle registration tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">In this way, consumers will be fully aware of the incentives that are being created through changes to the motor taxation system. This will assist them in making informed decisions. The new labelling regime will be promoted as part of the climate change campaign. Separate legislation to give effect to labelling proposals will be brought forward shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_964">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently preparing legislation to establish the National Property Services Regulatory Authority (NPSRA) on a statutory footing. This legislation will provide for licensing and standards-setting for property management agents and other property services providers. Details of the proposed legislation are available on that Department's website, www.justice.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The legislation will give effect to key recommendations of the Auctioneering-Estate Agency Review Group on which my Department was represented.  My Department was also consulted in 2006 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as part of that Department's preparation of proposals for the Government regarding the establishment of the NPSRA. More recently the two Departments have been in contact as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform drafts the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">My Department has no function in relation to the operation of property management companies. These companies, consisting of the owners of dwellings, are generally constituted under the Companies Acts and are required to operate in compliance with company law, which comes within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the lead role in progressing issues relating to management companies. It chairs a high-level interdepartmental committee, also involving the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance and my Department, to consider the matters involved, including any recommendations for legislative changes that may be contained in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments.  Any necessary legislation relating to the regulation of management companies will be progressed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment being involved in relation to any company law aspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">Subject to the finalisation of the above processes, I have no proposals to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to management companies.  However, my Department has issued updated policy guidance to planning authorities on the taking in charge of estates.  One of the main principles now set out in the overall framework for taking in charge is that, in general, planning authorities must not require the establishment of management companies as a condition of planning in respect of traditional housing estates, save in very exceptional circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government  (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_971">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 103 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">The Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and the National Development Plan 2007-2013 (NDP) reflect the strong commitment to expand social and affordable housing provision contained in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  The NDP provides the resources — some €18 billion in total — which will support increased output from social and affordable housing measures and result in the needs of some 140,000 new households being met in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Within this, a significant programme of activity to assist house purchase is provided for. In particular, over the period of the NDP, some 40,000 households will benefit from affordable housing.  In addition, the needs of some 100,000 households are to be met through a range of social housing measures, including through the commencement and acquisition of 63,000 new social homes in the period 2007-2013.  Over the period   2007 to 2009, sufficient resources will be made available to commence or acquire some 27,000 of these.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The impact of the record levels of investment this Government is committing to these housing programmes is already evident.  Last year, over 13,000 social and affordable housing units were delivered and, overall, the needs of almost 18,300 households were met through the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes, 24% up on 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">The funding provided for housing programmes has been increased again in 2008, with some €2.5 billion available to local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative sectors for their activities.  This will allow for the commencement of a significant number of new social housing units, further progress under regeneration programmes, and the completion of a large number of units under both the local authority and voluntary housing programmes.  Preparations for the introduction of a new Incremental Purchase Scheme are also underway and a study on affordable housing delivery mechanisms is currently the subject of a public consultation process, with a view to submitting proposals to Government in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">I am satisfied that Part V of the Planning and Development Acts is operating effectively, evidenced by its significantly increased delivery of both social and affordable housing. From a position where just 46 homes were delivered under Part V in 2002, delivery has increased significantly since then, with over 3,240 social and affordable homes coming on stream under this mechanism in 2007.  In total, up to the end of 2007, over 7,600 social and affordable houses had been acquired and in excess of 5,000 units were in progress at that stage on foot of Part V agreements with developers.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Local authorities are currently carrying out the 2008 statutory housing needs assessment, the results of which will be published in due course. While comprehensive information on the numbers applying for affordable housing is not collected by my Department, the indications are that demand for affordable housing remains strong in certain areas, particularly in the Greater Dublin Area and near other major urban centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 107 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste sets challenging targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  In the case of Ireland, the diversion rates required are projected to equate to 59% for 2010, 73% by 2013 and 80% by 2016 for this particular waste stream.  The recent National Waste Report 2006 published in January 2008 by the EPA presents the scale of the challenge in sharp focus: while the recovery rate for this waste stream increased to 38% from 35% in 2005, the quantity of this waste going to landfill rose by 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">A National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, published in 2006, sets out a wide range of integrated measures, designed in accordance with the waste hierarchy, to support biodegradable municipal waste minimisation and diversion from landfill.  The Programme for Government is clearly committed to the effective implementation of this Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">My Department is supporting the roll-out by local authorities of segregated ‘brown bin' collections for food and garden waste; this will make a significant contribution to diversion of household waste from landfill as we have already seen in places like Galway and Waterford.  In addition, it has become clear that landfill gate fees have fallen thereby making landfill more attractive as a waste disposal option.  I have, therefore, recently announced my intention to increase the landfill levy to encourage recycling and will shortly be making an Order and associated Regulations to give effect to the proposed increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">In line with the commitment given in the Programme, a major review of waste policy is currently being initiated.  The review will examine the potential contribution that mechanical-biological treatment (MBT) and other technologies can deliver towards our landfill diversion targets, particularly in the context of recovering the biodegradable fraction in residual waste arising from domestic households.  I have already placed on the record my position that an over reliance on incineration is not the answer for residual waste treatment.</p>

The primary aim of these guidelines on design standards for new apartments is to promote sustainable urban housing by ensuring that the design and lay-out of new apartments will provide satisfactory accommodation for a variety of household types and sizes, including families with children, over the medium to long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">More recently in February 2008, I published draft Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas for public consultation.

            <p eId="para_1067">Standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">As part of the Action Plan to promote improvement in standards of private rented accommodation, my Department requested the Centre for Housing Research to undertake a study of measures to promote improvements in these standards and develop good practice guidelines to assist housing authorities in their functions relating to the private rented sector. Two reports — the first entitled Good Practice in Housing Management: Guidelines for Local Authorities, the second Promoting Improved Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Review of Policy and Practice — were published by the Centre in late 2007 and were launched by my predecessor at the Housing Practitioners' Conference in November 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">Copies of these reports were circulated by the Centre for Housing Research to a wide range of relevant bodies including local authorities. As set out in the reports, it is a matter for each local authority, having regard to its particular situation, to decide on its own approach to the recommendations contained in these reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Relevant recommendations from the reports are also being taken into account in the review of the regulations relating to the standards for private rented accommodation, which is currently underway.  I expect to be publishing revised regulations in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">In addition, my Department is providing significantly increased funds from the proceeds of tenancy registration fees to support local authorities in their inspection functions relating to the private rented sector. Over €7m has been provided to local authorities for this purpose since 2004, and I expect to provide further increased resources in respect of 2008, linked to actual inspection performance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">The Green Paper, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, presents a set of options which share a common theme of strengthening local democratic leadership. In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, Stronger Local Democracy proposes a Regional Mayor for Dublin to address the strategic challenges the city faces. The Paper also considers that local leadership, accountability and connection with the citizen can be achieved through the provision of directly elected mayors, with key powers of initiative, for all counties and cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">Stronger Local Democracy proposes for examination measures such as the empowerment of existing town councils through devolved decision making and the negotiated transfer of functions from county to town level. The Paper states that town government can best be empowered by giving local councillors a greater say in decision making while working with county council staff and resources to implement those decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">The Green Paper is part of a transparent, inclusive policy formulation process. It includes key proposals for strengthening local democracy and sets out a range of options as to how those proposals may be brought forward.

            <p eId="para_1081">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 134 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">Section 144 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides powers of direction in respect of a tenancy that is not registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) but which, in the opinion of the Board, ought to be registered. The improper use of licensing arrangements in order to avoid tenancy registration is an offence under the Act and a person found guilty of such an offence is, on summary conviction, liable to a fine of up to €3,000 and/or up to six months imprisonment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The PRTB has a function of reviewing the operation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and of making recommendations for the amendment of the Act and any other related enactments, where this is considered necessary. I am open to considering any such recommendations and am aware that the PRTB has recently identified possible amendments to the Act that may enhance the Board's operations. These amendments are being considered in the context of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">I understand that the PRTB has, in reviewing the operation of the 2004 Act, considered licensing arrangements and makes no recommendations in this regard. Such issues are understood not to be the subject of a significant number of cases received by the PRTB. The Board is however mindful of the need to ensure that tenancy registration requirements are not avoided through licensing and other arrangements and will continue to adopt a robust approach in dealing with any such cases arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 provides that the Minister may make regulations prescribing standards for houses let for rent or other valuable consideration. Minimum standards for private rented accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 1993.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The revision of the Standards Regulations is an important element of an Action Programme to promote improvement in standards, which was launched on foot of the Towards 2016 agreement.  My Department, in consultation with local authority and sectoral representatives, is conducting a review of these Regulations and I intend to finalise the revised Regulations in July.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_412">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1091">I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 126, 137 and 139 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">My Department's Report on the Status of Habitats and Species in Ireland is the first comprehensive compilation of the status of those habitats, animals and plants in Ireland which have protected status under national and EU law.  The Report highlights the pressures and threats that habitats and species face in Ireland including through peat cutting, overgrazing and undergrazing, pollution, unsustainable exploitation, and from alien species and recreational pressure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">The Report is important and highlights many substantial and difficult challenges.  The critical issue in the next few years will be the need to maintain and restore habitats, especially in Special Areas of Conservation, and to monitor and report on changes achieved. Ireland is currently moving from a phase of designation to one of more targeted management and protection. This requires the involvement of land owners, Government Departments, planning authorities and licensing agencies, and my Department is carrying out substantial work with the relevant groups to improve the situation. The Programme for Government 2007-2012 includes a commitment to strengthen Ireland's implementation of the Habitats Directive and I have secured greatly increased funding for my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">The report was compiled according to a strict template provided by the European Commission. The template required that any deterioration in status in recent times should receive an assessment of "poor"; and any significant deterioration an assessment of "bad".  For a habitat or species to achieve good status, there must be evidence that it is being maintained or is improving, and it must have good prospects in the future. The results outlined in the report reflect the position that many of these habitats and species were already considered threatened, that Ireland has seen substantial economic growth and agricultural intensification, and that the assessments cover all the habitat or species range, both inside and, critically, outside protected areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">There are already significant policies and work programmes in place which will address the conclusions in the Report.  These include the designation of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, respectively; continued enforcement of the Habitats Regulations to protect SACs and SPAs; the Single Farm Payment scheme which removes incentives for overgrazing, the Commonage Framework Plans which assessed appropriate grazing levels on commonages; implementation of the Water Framework Directive; the Water Services Investment Programme; and the ban on drift netting of salmon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">In relation to the freshwater pearl mussel, 19 sites have been designated as SACs for this species and these sites contain about 85% of the known populations of the mussel.   The Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food earlier in 2008 published a document on requirements for forestry management in the catchments of pearl mussel rivers. In addition, I will be making Regulations later this year on water quality objectives for freshwater pearl mussel rivers. Given the extreme threat to this species, my Department is also funding a programme of captive breeding in several locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">A number of significant steps have been taken in recent years to secure the long term future of the otter in Ireland.  44 SACs have been designated for the otter of which most are large sites incorporating extensive river, lake or coastal systems. My Department has also liaised closely with the National Roads Authority to prepare strict guidance for the protection of otters during the planning and construction of national roads. Furthermore, considerable efforts are being made under the Water Framework Directive and the Water Services Investment Programme, to improve water quality nationally. Significant progress has been made in recent years to eliminate water pollution from non-domestic and domestic sources and progress is also underway in this regard within the agricultural and forestry sectors. A Species Action Plan has also been recently published by my Department for the otter which outlines the conservation actions that are needed to secure the future of the otter throughout Ireland over the coming five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">In relation to the hare, my Department conducted the first national hare survey of Ireland in 2006 and 2007. The survey showed that the Irish hare is widespread, occurring throughout the entire country. However, population densities for Irish hare were found to be highly variable and it seems that populations can rapidly increase and decrease in a short space of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">My Department has also published, together with the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland, an all Ireland Species Action Plan for the Irish hare. This plan identifies actions to be delivered in areas such as policy and legislation, site safeguard and management and research and monitoring. Implementation of the actions identified is ongoing. While the recent survey estimates suggest that the population is healthy, the hare was assessed as "poor" in this report due to habitat loss through agricultural intensification and the expansion of towns and cities into formerly rural areas.  Measures in relation to the Atlantic salmon include the ban on drift netting of salmon.</p>

            <p eId="para_1120">General purpose grants from the Local Government Fund are structured to bring about equalisation, over time, so that each authority will have sufficient resources, either from central grants or from its local income base, to provide an acceptable level of day to day services to its customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">In determining these grants I take into account a number of factors including the overall funding available for this purpose, the estimated cost to each authority of providing an acceptable level of day to day services to their customers, the income each authority should generate from local sources and the necessity to provide each authority with a baseline allocation that will ensure financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">The Needs and Resources Model has been used in determining these grants since the year 2000.  While the Model has been refined and adjusted since it was introduced, there have been a number of significant changes to local authorities' expenditure and income patterns and financial systems over this period.  It is intended therefore that the Model will be kept under review with a view to maintaining the process of equalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">Longford County Council's general purpose allocation for 2008 is €15,522,985, an increase of 5.91% over the 2007 allocation.  General purpose grants to Longford County Council have increased by some 265% since 1997, which is more than a third higher than the average increase to local authorities over that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1132">I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 454 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is at the mid-point in its initial implementation period and is operational in all housing authorities, with, in some cases, the County Council managing the scheme for the county at large. All housing authorities have transferred cases from Rent Supplement to RAS and, since the commencement of transfers in September 2005, the pace of delivery has increased.  Some 13,000 households with long-term housing need have been accommodated to date in either voluntary, private rental properties or other social housing options.  €51 million is being provided to local authorities for RAS for the current year and the aim is that a total of at least 15,000 cases will have been accommodated through the scheme by the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The experience to date suggests that the response to meeting the needs of households on rent supplement with a long term housing need in some areas will be mainly through the existing local authority and voluntary/co-operative housing programmes. In other areas, particularly in larger urban areas, RAS will play a substantial role in meeting housing need. Over the longer-term the use of leased accommodation will become an integral part of the approach of local authorities to meeting social housing need. Ultimately this is a matter for local authorities to decide taking into account demographic factors, the available supply of different types of social housing, the level of long-term housing need in the area, market conditions and the individual aspirations of households.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">As indicated, the Rental Accommodation Scheme is midway through its implementation period and my Department is currently carrying out a Value for Money and Policy Review of the scheme to date.  A report of the review is currently at an advanced stage of drafting. A specific aim of the review is to evaluate the operation of RAS in the light of the objectives set for it, including the financial arrangements under which the scheme operates.  A further review is planned for the scheme, at the end of the implementation period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme is part of a revised framework of grant aid, introduced in November 2007, to assist older people and people with a disability with their accommodation needs.  The Scheme, which amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme (SHAE), is designed to provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">The Scheme facilitates the implementation of a Government Decision, taken in February 2006, to transfer the SHAE from the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department.  That decision arose on foot of a recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report that a more integrated service and better value for money may be achieved by transferring responsibility for the SHAE to the local authorities, who already had responsibility for the Essential Repairs and Disabled Persons Grant Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">I am conscious of the need to ensure a smooth and seamless transfer of the SHAE from the HSE to the local authority sector.  For that reason it is essential to allow sufficient time to resolve relevant issues, including the allocation of staffing and other resources. It has therefore been agreed with the HSE that the Scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the HSE, until such time as the appropriate arrangements are in place to ensure that the local authorities are in a position to accept the scheme on transfer.  My Department is engaged on an ongoing basis with the HSE to conclude this process as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">In the meantime, applicants who require repairs or improvements to their homes can avail of either the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme or the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1606">Active Citizenship is a priority area for the Taoiseach evidenced in the fact that he has assigned special responsibility to me to lead this initiative as Minister of State in his Department.  Over the coming years, I look forward to working with the various stakeholders in this area of community cohesion and social interaction.  Working together, I believe that we can achieve a strong policy and delivery platform for all citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship covered a wide and cross-cutting range of public policy areas specific to a number of Government Departments.  The recommendations also relate to the community and voluntary sectors, to business and educational interests and, of course, to individual citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">I am currently undertaking a series of meetings with key officials in my own Department and in relevant other Departments to assess the level of progress on implementation to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">The Deputy will be aware that the timescales for the recommendations will vary in terms of the complexities of consultations required in Departments with their respective stakeholders and in terms of resource issues and detailed planning of initiatives.  I am, however, pleased to report that the audit of community facilities has commenced under the direction of Local Authorities and coordinated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">The Green Paper on Local Government Reform was recently published by Minister Gormley.  It seeks to strengthen the links between local government and communities.  I intend to progress the Active Citizenship agenda as quickly as possible.  I will be assisted in this work by a Steering Group, especially in the areas of public policy, business and the media chaired by  Mary Davis.  I will guide and support the Active Citizenship Office in the implementation of the recommendations.  In the coming months, I look forward to supplying more extensive updates on the important elements of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Active Citizenship.</p>

            <p eId="para_1751">Traditionally the recruitment grades to the civil service were at Clerical Officer, Executive Officer and Administrative Officer (graduate) levels.  Appointments to the middle management grades of Higher Executive Officer and Assistant Principal and more senior management grades of Principal Officer and above were made exclusively through internal promotion processes and therefore were confined to serving civil servants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">These arrangements changed as a result of the National Partnership Agreement Sustaining Progress 2003-2005.  In this agreement arrangements were put in place for open recruitment into the civil service at Higher Executive Officer (HEO), Assistant Principal (AP) and Principal (PO) levels.  The quota of vacancies to be filled was to equal the number of staff who had resigned from the civil service in the previous year to take up positions in the private sector or elsewhere in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">As a direct result of this agreement recruitment campaigns open to all qualified people were launched in 2003 and 2005.  These campaigns were initiated to fill the vacancies that arose as a result of civil servants leaving to take up positions in the private or wider public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">For the 2005 Open Higher Executive Officer Competition 2,737 applications were received.  Based on the agreed criteria in Sustaining Progress it was determined that 3 positions were due to be filled.  The Public Appointments Service could, if the need had arisen, have filled many more vacancies from this campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">While initially small in number, the establishment of the principle of open recruitment to higher grades is an important one in the context of the public service modernisation programme.  Subsequent National Agreements have now significantly increased the quota of people who can enter the civil service at senior management grades from outside the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">Costs:</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">For reasons of efficiency and economies of scale the Open HEO campaign was run alongside a number of other campaigns (Open AP and Confined AP).  This meant that test centres were shared as indeed were staff costs and advertising costs.  It is not possible therefore to be definitive and apportion specific costs to the HEO campaign component alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The approximate cost for the running of this particular HEO campaign was €37,000.  This included: equipment hire, staff costs, staff expenses, venue hire and advertising.</p>

            <p eId="para_2227">Before addressing the specifics of the Deputy's question, I might firstly explain that the first and most robust line of defence for depositors is a well-managed system of prudential regulation and supervision so as to minimise the risk that a Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) might need to be activated.  Recent assessments by reputable international bodies such as the IMF and the OECD have confirmed that the Irish system of financial regulation complies with best international practice.  I might also add that Irish banks are well capitalised, liquid, profitable with strong asset quality and no material exposure to sub-prime securitisations and are thus well placed to cope with the uncertainty currently prevailing at the international level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">As regards the coverage of the current Irish DGS, the Deputy will probably be aware that it guarantees 90% of deposits with a credit institution up to a limit of €22,222, which means that the maximum payout is €20,000.  This is in line with the requirements of the EU Deposit Guarantee Directive and as highlighted in the recent OECD Economic Survey of Ireland, it is in the mainstream of European law and practice and should be sufficient to provide protection to the vast majority of depositors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">The Deputy may be aware that arising from an ECOFIN Council meeting in October 2007 in the wake of the dislocation in the global financial markets, the EU has been considering possible enhancements to the EU Deposit Guarantee Directive. This review is ongoing and Ireland is participating in those discussions.  I and my Department will consider the efficacy of national arrangements in the light of this to ensure that savers in Ireland benefit from safeguards in line with EU best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2320">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Customs Officers have powers to search persons at ports and airports under the Customs Acts. Officers must, in the first instance, have reason to suspect that a person has concealed on his/her person uncustomed or prohibited goods (including drugs) which have been imported or that the person is attempting to export prohibited goods. The authorisation of a senior officer must be obtained before a person is searched. This officer reviews the case to ensure there is a valid reason for the search and that such action is proportionate in the circumstances of the case before the search is allowed to proceed. The officer(s) conducting a search must be of the same sex as the person to be searched. Search rooms are provided for this purpose in all the larger ports and airports. Officers are trained in search of person as part of their enforcement training programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">Customs also have powers under proceeds of crime legislation to search persons if they suspect an attempt is being made to import or export cash which is not less than the prescribed amount (currently €6,350) and that the cash directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime or is intended by the person for use in connection with any criminal conduct.</p>

            <p eId="para_2334">I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Customs controls at the airports listed are risk based and are carried out by mobile Special Compliance/Enforcement staff. A drugs detector dog is used frequently and attendance by staff is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of general seizure trends, traffic frequency, route and similar risk indicators. These attendances are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increase at the airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the European Union. Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than anti-smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of aerodromes listed where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community.  In this context, Revenue's approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">The Revenue Commissioners assure me that having regard to the context set out above, they are satisfied that their risk based approach, which is in line with the methodology adopted by other EU administrations in similar circumstances, remains valid.  I am also assured that the Revenue Commissioners will continue their strong commitment to playing their part in combating smuggling criminal activity without unduly impeding international travellers or international trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">I am advised that a risk rating for these airports was carried out at the beginning of this year and is due to be reviewed by 30 June 2008.  Any enforcement issues arising from this review will be dealt with.</p>

Since 2000 the European Commission has imposed Cohesion Fund financial corrections for breaches of tendering amounting to €10.3 million.  This represents only about 0.5% of the total of €2,081.2 million in Cohesion funding approved for Ireland in the 1993-2003 period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2532">The yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2544">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 190 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who are living at home and who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance.  The current Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is €299.60 per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">Entitlement to Domiciliary Care Allowance ceases on the child's 16th birthday. However, when the child is approaching the age of 16, the HSE advise the family to apply for the Disability Allowance, operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I understand that the Health Service Executive notify the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the child at least six months prior to the child's 16th birthday. Claimants must satisfy a means test and medical criteria.  The personal Disability Allowance rate is €197.80 per week. While the automatic entitlement to respite care grant lapses with the Domiciliary Care Allowance, a respite care grant is available from the Department of Social and Family affairs, subject to the satisfaction of eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">There are no proposals to extend the age limit of the Domiciliary Care Allowance.  My Department has asked the HSE, if it is possible, to estimate the cost of extending the age limit to 18 years of age net of those people who would switch to Disability Allowance and to reply directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2551">The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) will shortly implement a quality assured national population based screening programme, so that unnecessary deaths from cervical cancer among women can be avoided. The (NCSS) have announced a preferred bidder for the provision of laboratory testing services for the National Cervical Screening Programme. This is an important milestone which will enable the NCSS to launch the first quality assured, population based National Cervical Screening Programme for women in Ireland aged 25-60 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">The Deputy will appreciate that quality is a critical requirement of the new programme in the context of patients' best interests. In keeping with EU procurement legislation, the procurement process is being conducted in an open and competitive manner.  Submissions were invited from local and international laboratories during the process. Quality standards formed the key measurement criteria and there were strict quality criteria/accreditation required. The necessary entry criteria in choosing a cytology partner also included a laboratory dealing with a volume of a minimum of 25,000 smears per annum.  These criteria were chosen in line with international acceptable criteria for cervical screening programmes.  The NCSS has concluded that the preferred bidder can deliver a service that meets all of the required quality criteria.  The initial contractual period with laboratories will be for a two year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2553">The HSE has undertaken a review of its laboratory medicine services.  I welcome steps that are being taken by certain HSE funded laboratories to secure accreditation.  I believe that if all those involved work together in partnership there is scope to provide high quality and cost effective services within HSE funded laboratories.  The National Hospitals Office (NHO) of the HSE  has a commitment to staff currently employed in cytology services, and has met with their representative.  Any decisions regarding reassignment of employees will be addressed after the National Cancer Screening Service has completed the procurement process for cytology services.</p>

            <p eId="para_2595">The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established in May 2007.  The Board has statutory responsibility for planning, designing, building, furnishing and equipping the new National Paediatric Hospital.</p>

The Executive is working closely with the Development Board in progressing the project.</p>

Tenders for a Business Adviser Service are currently being evaluated by the Board, while invitations to tender issued recently to short-listed candidates for Planning and Design support services (including architects, engineers etc).  Tenders are required to be submitted to the Board by the end of May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">Following the recruitment of the support teams, the next stage of the project will involve the preparation of a detailed Development Brief for the new hospital. This will build on the work undertaken for the HSE by RKW, which involved the preparation of a High Level Framework Brief for the hospital. The target of the Board is to have the Development Brief completed by the end of the 1st Quarter 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">The Brief will be converted into a detailed design, outlining the exact dimensions and specifications for the new hospital, to allow the project proceed to tender for construction.</p>

            <p eId="para_2608">At present there is no legislation in Ireland governing laser eye treatment.  However, the involvement of medical practitioners in this practice is subject to the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act and the Medical Council's guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2609">Under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, the Medical Council is charged with responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities.  The Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides for a clear compulsory requirement for registration of all medical practitioners, changes to the Fitness to Practise process and the introduction of a mandatory scheme for the maintenance of professional competence.  Provision is also made for the Medical Council to have a function in relation to advertising by registered medical practitioners.  The Act will be commenced on a phased basis over the coming months.  When commenced, these and other new provisions of the Act will afford greater protection to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2610">In January 2007, the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  One of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for public and private health care providers and services. The Commission is due to report by July this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2612">Section 10(c) of the Adoption Act, 1952, as amended by Section 2 of the 1964 Act provides that, in order to be eligible for adoption, a child must be "illegitimate or an orphan" or be a child who has been legitimated, but whose birth has not been re-registered. The Adoption Act, 1988, does permit the adoption of any child (including children of marriage) but only in exceptional and very limited circumstances where the parents are shown to have completely abandoned their parental duties, and there is an expectation that they will continue to do so until the child reaches the age of eighteen. After its passage through the Oireachtas, the President referred the Adoption Bill, 1988 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on whether the provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution. While it was found to be Constitutional, and subsequently became the Adoption Act, 1988,  it was clear that these narrow circumstances, based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution, were the basis for the decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2613">The Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children and included a provision to ensure that all children would be eligible for voluntary adoption, subject to appropriate consents. The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 and to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children [JCCAC] was established in November, 2007, to report back within four months, on the proposals set out in the Bill. The Committee recently received Dáil and Seanad approval for an extension of their timeframe to 30th November 2008. The Committee is now progressing with its work and the Government awaits the outcome of its deliberations before proceeding further with the proposed amendment of the Constitution in relation to children.</p>

            <p eId="para_2694">I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 to 225, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">Under the Child Care Act, 1991 the Health Service Executive (HSE) has the responsibility of promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  Social workers have the major responsibility in HSE child protection duties under this Act and conduct assessments under this legislative basis.  These responsibilities are carried out through locally based community care teams.  The thrust of the 1991 Child Care Act promotes the welfare of children within their own families where possible, with the welfare of the child being regarded as the first and paramount principle.  The social work service in the HSE actively supports children being cared for in their own family environment through its family support programmes.  There are, however, a number of vulnerable families who despite intensive family support input have long-standing and/or acute difficulties which require a different intervention.  Health Service staff are then engaged in assessing the risk to children's welfare, and whether or not they can safely remain in the care of their families.  Partnership with the Garda Síochána as outlined in Children First — National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children is an essential element of this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2696">The introduction of Children First — National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children was intended as an aid to professionals to recognise and respond effectively to children who are vulnerable to abuse and neglect in various forms, arising from their dependency and vulnerability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2697">In relation to the Deputy's question on whether all allegations of children are investigated by social workers, I have asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE to arrange to have this information issued directly to the Deputy. In relation to the statistics sought by the Deputy, from 1998 to 2005 the Department of Health and Children collated information from the HSE's Child Care Interim Dataset.  From 2005 the HSE has the responsibility for the collation of this information.  Extracts from the Analysis of Child Care Interim Dataset Reports from the years 1998 to 2004, which are relevant to the Deputy's questions, are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.  In relation to data from 2005 to date my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this information issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2699">Neither my Department nor the Health Service Executive has a direct responsibility for the operation and management of private hospitals. I am not therefore in a position to provide the information sought by the Deputy in that regard.  My Department has requested the Health Service Executive to forward directly to the Deputy the detailed information sought by him in respect of public hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2700">In 2001 the Government made a commitment, in the context of the Health Strategy Quality and Fairness, to increase public acute hospital bed numbers by 3,000 over ten years.  This commitment included both acute in-patient beds and day places.  The Government is substantially on target to reach this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_2701">In 2001 the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145, based on returns to the Department (11,374 in-patient beds and 771 day places).  The number of acute hospital beds recorded by the HSE for 2006 was 13,771 (12,574 in-patient beds and 1,197 day places) based on a total bed complement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2702">This represents an increase of over 1,600, an average of some 325 new bed and day places per year, a very high level of annual increase by historic standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2703">The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds. About 1,000 of these will be provided through the co-location initiative and the balance through the HSE's capital plan, which is part of the National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2704">With regard to the important area of home supports, a key-stone of the Government's policy in relation to older people is to support them to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2705">In this context, over €190 million additional funding was provided in Budgets 2006 and 2007 to expand a wide range of existing community-based services.  These include Home Care Packages, Home Helps, Meals-on-Wheels, and Day/Respite Care.  This has significantly enhanced the capacity of the HSE to meet increasing service demands in the last two years. In 2007, for example, the Executive:</p>
            <p eId="para_2706">had in place some 4,300 Home Care Packages, benefitting in the region of 11,500 clients;</p>
            <p eId="para_2707">provided around 11.7 million Home Help hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2708">supported in excess of 21,000 Day Care places.</p>
            <p eId="para_2709">In addition to these community based developments, the HSE's Fast Track Beds Initiative is due to provide 860 public beds over the period 2007-2009 under the Executive's capital programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2710">The HSE earlier this year published a Review of Acute Bed Capacity carried out by PA Consulting, together with a HSE discussion document which proposes an integrated approach to health service delivery.  The Review considered that taking account of such factors as our ageing population and the increase in chronic diseases, we will need to plan for a 60% increase in demand for health care by 2020.  It suggests that if current practices and processes were to continue, the demand for public hospital beds would escalate to nearly 20,000 by 2020.  To meet this need we would have to provide the equivalent of twelve new 600-bed hospitals over the period to 2020.  It concludes that such reliance on acute hospitals for service delivery is neither sustainable nor in the best interests of patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2711">The Review examined alternative approaches to meeting this demand.  It recommends an integrated approach to health service delivery involving substantial change in the way care is provided.  Among the measures proposed are significant increases in day beds in hospitals, more long-term care beds, more rehabilitation beds and more services in community-based, non-acute hospital settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2712">The Review outlines a number of bed demand scenarios.  It suggests for example, that if the proposed model of integrated health service delivery was 100% operational by 2020, the number of acute beds required could be reduced to about 8,800.  If the model was 75% operational, the number would be about 10,700; at 50% the number is estimated at about 13,000 and at 25% the number is about 16,000.  It makes the point that other developed countries, such as Australia, Canada, Denmark and England have achieved results of this kind through their reform programmes.  It also points out that some of our hospitals are already achieving the required efficiencies, such as shorter lengths of stay, more day surgery and admission on day of surgery.  The challenge is to achieve these standards of service across the entire acute system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2713">Pending the implementation of such reforms, the Review estimates that 1,100 additional acute hospital beds are needed to meet current demand. As outlined the Government has already committed itself to providing 1,500 extra acute beds through a combination of direct capital investment and the co location initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2714">The Review forms a basis for discussion with key stakeholders on how best to plan for the provision of public health care delivery to 2020.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2732">I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 to 234, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2733">Following publication of the Pollock Report in 2005, the Health Service Executive established a Working Group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services.  The Group, which was multi-disciplinary in its composition, was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland.  The Group identified a range of service improvements required for persons with Cystic Fibrosis, including the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professional staffing in Cystic Fibrosis units around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2734">Arising from the Pollock Report and the emerging recommendations of the Working Group, I identified the development of cystic fibrosis services as a policy priority in the Estimates process.  In 2006 and 2007, additional revenue funding of €6.78 million was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2735">My Department is advised by the HSE that 44 additional staff dealing with cystic fibrosis were recruited on foot of this additional funding and that the necessary funding is available to facilitate the recruitment of a further 37 staff nationally.  The HSE was asked to place a particular focus on the development of services at the National Adult Tertiary Referral Centre at St. Vincent's Hospital.  A number of capital projects have recently been completed at the hospital and have helped to improve facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2736">However, it is accepted that these developments do not fully address the immediate needs of patients.  The HSE has been working intensively with the Hospital and with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to progress options for further interim improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2737">In the longer term, a new ward block is to be built and will include 120 replacement beds in single en-suite accommodation.  The new facility will accommodate cystic fibrosis patients and will include appropriate isolation facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">Beaumont Hospital operates as a regional centre in providing services to adults with cystic fibrosis.  In the 2008 Budget, a special allocation of €2.5m capital funding was provided to enable Beaumont Hospital to provide out patient facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">I understand that the Report of the Health Service Executive Working Group on Cystic Fibrosis will include a recommendation that cross border arrangements should be facilitated if this provides closer access to specialist care and is the preference for the person with cystic fibrosis.  The requirement for such an arrangement will need to be considered by the HSE in the context of the implementation of the Working Group recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">From my perspective I am supportive of collaborative arrangements between our respective health authorities which reduce the distance patients have to travel and which have the potential to match or improve health outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the other issues raised, including the provision of services in the North West and the publication of the Working Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_2745">Responsibility for the enforcement of labelling and traceability legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and its official agents, which includes the Health Service Executive and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">Between 2005 and 2007 the Health Service Executive (HSE) reported to the FSAI that, in the course of its inspection programme, 3,683 breaches of labelling regulations were detected.  Food business operators were notified of these non-compliances and appropriate follow up action was taken.  The HSE has taken 58 prosecutions against food business operators in this period, some of which included charges in relation to labelling.  I have asked the Chief Executive Officer of the FSAI to forward, directly to the Deputy, details of how many of these prosecutions relate to labelling and how many of these prosecutions resulted in convictions.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has indicated to the FSAI that between 2005 and 2007 it detected 662 breaches in relation to the labelling of poultry and egg products.  Food business operators were notified of these non-compliances and appropriate follow up action was taken.  Two prosecutions were taken in 2007 and 105 seizure notices were served.  In June 2007 the FSAI secured a conviction in the District Court against a food business operation for illegal labelling of food.  In March of this year South Dublin County Council secured a conviction in the District Court against a food business operator for breaches of general and beef labelling legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2748">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_2749">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioner services.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006, I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For medical card and GP visit card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this general review, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards in the context of economic/financial, medical and social need is being undertaken with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card, and is expected to be completed by Autumn 2008.  This review will have regard, inter alia, to the Programme for Government commitment in respect of medical cards and GP visit cards to treble the income limit eligibility of parents of children with an intellectual disability under 18 years of age.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2752">The Government is committed to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability as illustrated by the substantial investment in the disability sector over the last number of years.  An integral part of the National Disability Strategy is the Multi-Annual Investment Programme, published in December 2004, which contains details of specific commitments in relation to the provision of high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009.  These commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism in each of the years covered by the programme.  Additional funding was also provided to enhance the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services, available to adults and children with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and those with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">One of the central elements of the National Disability Strategy is The Disability Act 2005.  The Act is a positive measure designed to advance and underpin participation by people with disabilities in everyday life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2754">Part 2 contains the health and education related elements of the Disability Act 2005 and the Department of Health and Children together with the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and Science and the National Council for Special Education are working together on the implementation of Part 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_2755">In recognition of the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment, Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1 June, 2007.  Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides people with disabilities with an entitlement to: an independent assessment of health and education needs; a statement of the services (Service Statement) which it is proposed to provide; pursue a complaint through the Health Service Executive complaints process if necessary; make an appeal to the independent Disability Appeals Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004.  The Department of Education and Science has informed the Department that it is envisaged that all sections of the EPSEN Act 2004 will be implemented over a five year timeframe, with the assessment process as provided for in the EPSEN Act 2004 due to commence in 2010.  The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">In preparation for its implementation, health related support services for children aged 5 to 18 and adults will continue to be enhanced to enable the Health Service Executive to meet needs identified for this group.</p>

            <p eId="para_2763">Persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services qualify for a medical card, which entitles them to a range of health services free of charge.  In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who did not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">In general, eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is determined following an examination of the means of the applicant and his/her dependants (income and relevant outgoings).  The main exception is persons aged 70 and over, who have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card.  The GP visit card assessment threshold is 50% higher than the medical card threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2767">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, ‘A Vision for Change', which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a seven to ten year period.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">Responsibility for the implementation of the Report is a matter for the HSE and in this regard an Implementation Plan has now been approved by the HSE.  The plan sets out six key priorities for implementation in 2008 and 2009, including mental health services for people with an intellectual disability.  It is understood from the HSE that considerable work in planning the reconfiguration of mental health services for people with an intellectual disability was undertaken in 2007 following the Report of the Forum on Mental Health and Intellectual Disability.  That Report also had regard to the recommendations included in ‘A Vision for Change'.  Further progress on the reconfiguration of services, in association with the voluntary partners, is anticipated in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2824">The Mental Health Act 2001 provides a modern framework within which people who have a mental disorder and require treatment or protection can be cared for and treated.  It puts in place mechanisms by which the standards, care and treatment in mental health services can be monitored, inspected and regulated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2825">Sections 1 to 5, 7 and 31 to 55 of the Mental Health Act 2001 were commenced in April 2002.  These involved the establishment of the Mental Health Commission to promote, encourage and foster the establishment and maintenance of high standards and good practice in the delivery of mental health services and to promote the interests of people detained under the 2001 Act.  It also provided for the establishment of the Office of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, replacing the former Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">The remaining provisions of the Act were commenced on 1 November 2006.  This included the establishment of the Mental Health Tribunals, under the auspices of the Mental Health Commission.  The Tribunals conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis, or to extend the duration of such detention, the latter as a consequence of a renewal order at 3,6 and 12 month periods.</p>

            <p eId="para_2847">The National Disability Strategy was launched in September 2004 following a number of positive legislative and policy measures in prior years, and contains a suite of elements, principally the Disability Act 2005, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004, Sectoral Plans prepared by six government Departments during 2006, the Citizens Information Act 2007 and a multi-annual investment programme totalling some €900m between 2006 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2848">Recognising the cross-cutting nature of this subject, the Government announced the establishment of the Office for Disability and Mental Health in January 2008, to support the Minister for Disability &amp; Mental Health in exercising his responsibilities across four Government Departments: Health &amp; Children, Education &amp; Science, Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment and Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">The new Office brings together responsibility for a range of different policy areas and State services which directly impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health issues.  The Office will aim to bring about improvements in the manner in which services respond to the needs of people with disabilities and mental health issues, by working to develop person-centred services, focussing on the holistic needs of clients and service users and actively involving them in their own care.  The Director of the Office is a member of the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, which monitors progress on the Government's commitments in relation to social policy, including the National Disability Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">Very substantial progress has been made in recent years in the areas of disability and mental health, but much remains to be done.  In particular, there is a need to improve co-ordination and communication across different Government Departments and agencies in their delivery of services to this client group.   This will be the main focus for the new Office in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">A key priority for the Office for Disability and Mental Health is to support the implementation of the Health Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005.  The Office will focus in particular on facilitating the delivery of integrated health and education support services for children with special needs, by further developing existing mechanisms for co-operation and co-ordination between the health and education sectors, both at national and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2852">A Cross-Sectoral Team consisting of senior officials from the Office for Disability and Mental Health, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, the Health Service Executive and the National Council for Special Education was established in 2006 and meets on a regular basis. This group continues to address issues arising in relation to the implementation of both Acts. A sub-group of this team was set up in January 2008 in order to plan for the commencement of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 and the relevant sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 in respect of children aged between 5 and 18 and adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">The focus of these groups is on the interaction required between the education and health sectors in order to advance and enhance services to people with disabilities. A wide range of matters are discussed in these fora and the matter raised by the Deputy will be considered by the Cross-Sectoral Team in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_2865">The Deputy will be aware that the Health Service Executive must live within its overall allocation from the Oireachtas each year.  Under the Programme for Government, the Government has committed to removing the regional disparities in the provision and funding of palliative care, and to ensuring that the needs of all those who require palliative care are met. The Department of Health and Children is committed to working with the HSE and other key stakeholders in developing palliative care services throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">Funding is being provided for the development of palliative care services in line with the recommendations in the Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (2001) and in the context of available resources and workforce planning across the health service.  Additional funding totalling €18 million was provided by the Government in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Not all of this funding was used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its approved overall allocation.  Funding  was primarily in respect of 138 additional whole-time equivalent (WTE) posts to support a range of  new service developments nationally.  I understand that approx 40% of these posts have been filled to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2867">The Executive is developing a five-year capital and revenue implementation framework, in consultation with the Irish Association for Palliative Care, the Irish Hospice Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society. Work is ongoing on the development of this plan and good progress has been made to-date. The question of progressing outstanding service developments not yet implemented is being considered by the Executive in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2868">In relation to the additional €51.2 million development funding provided in 2006 and 2007 for the implementation of  A Vision for Change, the Department has been advised by the HSE that this was not used as planned because of competing expenditure pressures and the overriding obligation on the HSE to live within its approved overall allocation. As a result, some of the planned developments in mental health services have been delayed. However, some of these developments will proceed in 2008, for example the recruitment of 8 child and adolescent mental health teams and the provision of 18 beds for children and adolescents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2897">The use of Public Private Partnership procurement in relation to each of these projects represents an opportunity for value for money, innovation and optimal transfer of risk over the lifetime of the infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">The Metro North, Metro West and Luas Lucan line projects were identified at an early stage of Transport 21 for procurement as unitary payment PPPs. The Government, decided, earlier this year, that certain national road projects and elements of the DART Interconnector which were originally planned to be Exchequer funded would now be procured as unitary payment PPPs. The NRA subsequently identified the N11, N17 and N20 projects outlined above, as suitable for procurement as PPPs. The total amount of Exchequer and PPP expenditure under Transport 21 remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">The Exchequer will usually fund the planning phase of PPP projects, including obtaining the relevant statutory consents.  It may also fund advance land acquisition and preparatory works and in appropriate circumstances may provide a capital contribution towards the construction costs.  The cost to the Exchequer will be decided on a case-by-case basis for each PPP project and will be met from the overall Exchequer allocation in the Transport 21 capital envelope.</p>

            <p eId="para_2913">The provision and maintenance of regional and local roads in County Kildare is a matter for Kildare County Council to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State grants provided by my Department.  The upgrade of the Edenderry to Enfield road is being undertaken by Kildare County Council with grant assistance provided by my Department.  The Council has been allocated €2.5 million for this scheme in 2008.  The design of the route is primarily a matter for the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">Before works of this nature may proceed, the local authority is obliged to comply with requirements of planning legislation. I understand that those requirements, which include extensive public consultation, were complied with in respect of this project and that the works were approved by the elected members of Kildare County Council in December 2006.  My Department has no function in that process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2918">I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 to 286, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2919">The three States referred to in Deputy Mc Grath's question are among those which have decided not to take part in the Oslo Process because, as we understand it, they do not feel able to commit themselves to its objectives. Specifically, full participation in the Dublin Diplomatic Conference requires States to have endorsed the Declaration adopted at the preceding Wellington Conference in February 2008, which included a commitment to the objective of concluding at Dublin a legally binding instrument prohibiting cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. On that basis, 110 States are present in Dublin as participants with another 18 attending as observers. Naturally, following the adoption of a Convention at Dublin and its envisaged signature in Oslo in December, we will do all we can to encourage as many States as possible to become party to it.  Some 22 EU Member States are full participants in the Dublin Diplomatic Conference, while five are present as observers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">The last recorded use of cluster munitions by an EU Member State was by the UK in Iraq in 2003.  Several Member States have never had cluster munitions. This is the case with Ireland. Some others have already decided never to use them and to destroy their stockpiles. One of the most complex issues under negotiation at the Conference is the precise definition of a cluster munition which causes unacceptable harm to civilians and, as such, will be banned under the Convention. Up to 17 Member States possess weapons which might conceivably fall within the eventual definition agreed upon, but this remains to be determined.  All States which become party to the Convention will of course have to comply with its provisions, which it seems clear will include a prohibition on the acquisition or use of specified munitions and a requirement to destroy stockpiles.</p>
            <p eId="para_2921">Nationally, Ireland is, in line with the provisions of the Programme for Government, strongly pressing for the most ambitious outcome possible in the negotiations. Of course, as chair, and consistent with the Conference's rules of procedure, we have a particular responsibility to seek as broad a consensus as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2926">I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2927">The Government and our EU partners have expressed increasing concern at the serious and sustained erosion of human rights protections in Iran in recent years. We have been particularly concerned at the increase in the use of the death penalty, including executions of minors. Freedom of expression has been severely curtailed, and there has been an increase in the level of harassment of minority groups, including Iran's Baha'i community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2928">I am very concerned about the arrest of six members of the Baha'i faith in Tehran on 14 May. They are being detained and questioned by officials of the Ministry of Intelligence. On 21 May, the European Union called on Iran to release the six detainees. The EU stated clearly that Iran must act to uphold fully the right to adopt and practise a religion of choice and must end the persecution of the Baha'i community. I reiterate this position today, and repeat the Government's call for the release of the detainees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">Ireland participates actively in discussions within the EU on how best to advance our human rights concerns with Iran. In recent years, we have also co-sponsored a Resolution at the UN General Assembly on the human rights situation in Iran, along with Canada and others. We did so again last November. Regrettably, Iran has shown little interesting in engaging constructively on these issues. A formal Human Rights Dialogue between the EU and Iran is now effectively in abeyance. The last meeting was held during the Irish EU Presidency in 2004, and it seems clear that, for now, Iran is not willing to pursue the dialogue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2930">The Government and our EU partners will continue to use every opportunity to draw attention to, and where possible to uphold, the fundamental rights of the Iranian people. We will continue to raise our concerns about human rights abuses in our direct contacts with the Iranian authorities.</p>

All Employment Permits issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are granted specific to the employment in respect of which the application was made.  In addition, the Spousal/Dependant Scheme was introduced to give greater ease of access to employment for spouses/dependants of all employment permit holders, who have been admitted to the State under Family Reunification by:</p>

In recent months there have been two announcements for Carlow town with a potential to create a total of 370 new jobs. In February, 2008, Unum announced that it intended  to establish a strategic software service centre in Carlow town.  The new investment has the potential to create up to 200 new high-level positions and recruitment is currently underway.</p>

            <p eId="para_3028">Current projects underway in the Section include a review of the Competition Act 2002, a review of the Sale of Goods legislation and participation in the review of the EU Consumer Acquis.  In addition to providing the secretariat to the Advisory Group on Media Mergers which was established at the end of March, day to day work of the Section includes an oversight/support function in relation to both the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency and monitoring and contributing to competition and consumer developments at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3029">I remain committed to ensuring that the Competition and Consumer Policy Section is adequately resourced to enable it carry out its important work of delivering a modern and effective national competition and consumer policy.</p>

In this regard, NERA recovered almost €2.5 million in arrears in total in 2007 arising from breaches of certain employment rights legislation.

            <p eId="para_3103">Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC, [known as the Seveso Directive], applies to all establishments where the inventory of dangerous substances exceeds specified thresholds.  I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority that there are currently 90 such establishments notified to it.  Of these, 32 are classified as "upper tier", and as such, in accordance with Article 11 of the Directive, require that external emergency plans be prepared.</p>
            <p eId="para_3104">The European Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion to Ireland on 23 October 2007, concerning the failure by Ireland to draw up such external emergency plans in respect of 11 establishments.  The authorities in Ireland responsible for drawing up these external emergency plans are designated pursuant to the European Communities [Control of Major Accident Hazards] Regulations 2006, S.I. No. 74 of 2006.  These include Local Authorities, an Garda Síochána and the Health Services Executive.  I am informed that all but one external emergency plans are in place.  In relation to the one outstanding plan, I am informed that it is expected that the plan will be finalised before the end of next month.</p>

            <p eId="para_3106">The Employment Permits Section of my Department informs me that this application was refused on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for non-EEA nationals already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits.  Furthermore, the above named is resident in the State on a Visitor stamp and is, therefore, ineligible to enter employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3109">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_3110">I am informed by the Agency that in the 5-year period from 2003 to 2007, there have been a total of 1329 site visits by foreign investors to various locations around Ireland.  Details of these site visits are set out in Tabular Statement 1.</p>
            <p eId="para_3111">It is not possible, in the time available, to indicate the results of each of these individual site visits.  However, in the same 5-year period (2003-2007) there have been 78 announcements by foreign investors establishing Greenfield investments in this country, with a potential to create 12,405 jobs.  Details of those announcements are set out in Tabular Statement 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_3112">In the period 2003 to 2006 IDA Ireland paid out a total of €347,047,723 in grant payments to its client companies.  Details of grant payments in each of those years are set out in Tabular Statement 3.  Figures of grant payments for the year 2007 will not be available until the publication of the IDA's Annual Report later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3765">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), which is administered on behalf of the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Executive can also provide assistance with rent deposits to enable people to secure private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must satisfy a number of conditions including a means test and a habitual residence condition.  The Executive must also satisfy itself that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to those needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and their landlord.</p>
            <p eId="para_3767">Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the appropriate basic weekly payment rate of SWA, less €13. This €13 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants may also be required to contribute part of any assessable means which they have in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3768">In recent years improvements have been made in the means test to encourage eligible people to engage in employment without losing their entire rent supplement payment.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result o f taking up such an opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3769">In addition, rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person who engages in full time employment, subject to their satisfying the improved means testing arrangements, as outlined above, and where they have been accepted as having a long term housing need under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).</p>
            <p eId="para_3770">There are a number of other qualifying conditions such as the cost of the accommodation, application for local authority housing etc. which need to be considered by the Executive when determining entitlement for rent supplement.  More detailed descriptions of all of the qualifying conditions for rent supplement can be found on the Department's website (www.welfare.ie) under the heading of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3845">The back to education allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to work.  It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and in addition an annual €400 cost of education allowance is payable.  This will be increased to €500 from the beginning of the next academic year 2008/2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">To qualify for participation an applicant must, inter alia, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  People in receipt of disability allowance, blind pension and incapacity supplement may access the scheme at 18 years of age.  Similarly, lone parents and people in receipt of unemployment payments can qualify at 18 years of age if they have been out of formal education for at least 2 years.  An applicant must also be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, in the case of a person wishing to complete a second level course, or twelve months in the case of a person wishing to pursue a third level qualification.  The twelve-month requirement is reduced to nine in the case of people who wish to attend a third level course and who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan.  Under the plan persons aged 18 and under 64 years who are approaching three months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or offer of training.</p>

            <p eId="para_3848">Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly allowance administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Eligible children from birth to the age of 16 who are living at home and who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age may qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance.  The current Domiciliary Care Allowance rate is €299.60 per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3849">Entitlement to Domiciliary Care Allowance ceases on the child's 16th birthday.  However, when the child is approaching the age of 16, the HSE advise the family to apply for the Disability Allowance, operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I understand that the Health Service Executive notify the parent(s) or guardian(s) of the child at least six months prior to the child's 16th birthday.  Claimants must satisfy a means test and medical criteria.  The personal Disability Allowance rate is €197.80 per week.  While the automatic entitlement to respite care grant lapses with the Domiciliary Care Allowance, a respite care grant is available from the Department of Social and Family affairs, subject to the satisfaction of eligibility criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_3850">There are no proposals to extend the age limit of the Domiciliary Care Allowance.

            <p eId="para_3852">Disability allowance is a weekly allowance paid to people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66 years. The disability must be expected to last for at least one year and the allowance is subject to both a medical examination and a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_3853">Records in this Department show that 198 persons in the period February to December 2005, 246 persons in 2006, 248 persons in 2007 and 93 persons in the period January to April 2008 who were awarded Disability Allowance had been in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance.  Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment which provides financial support to families with children with severe disabilities up to the age of 16 years.  In addition, an annual respite care grant is also payable with the allowance.  This scheme is currently administered by the Health Service Executive under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.</p>

            <p eId="para_3856">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the Department, by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable the different eligible household types to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.</p>
            <p eId="para_3857">Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels.  This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low wage employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3858">Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the HSE may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits.  This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_3859">The current rent limits were set in January 2007.  A review of rent limits is currently being undertaken.  A consultative process is being used to ensure that the views of all relevant parties are sought and taken into account in the process.  This includes consultation with the HSE, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and voluntary agencies working in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3860">This process helps ensure that the new rent limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country.  As the review is still underway, no decisions have been made regarding what changes may be necessary.  Any adjustments to rent limits, resulting from this review, will be effective from 1 July 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3875">The disposal of waste materials in all sectors, including agricultural, is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3876">Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics — that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting — must take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question.  Since 1997 a silage plastic collection service has been operated by the Irish Farm Films Producers Group (IFFPG), and involves payment of a levy of €127 per tonne by producers (manufacturers and importers).  Since May 2006 an additional weight-based charge has also been levied on farmers.  The necessity for such a charge emerged from a review which sought to address a lack of resources to collect plastics, which resulted in a build-up on farms.  Stakeholders, including the farming organisations, were consulted on the introduction of this levy, which aims to incentivise the presentation of clean, dry plastic by farmers, and to help ensure that collection can be assured, by putting in place, along with the producers levy, an adequate return to contractors.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has no involvement in the running of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3877">As a temporary measure in order to deal with the backlog on farms, local authorities provided designated facilities where farmers could deposit stockpiled farm plastic free of charge.  In total, some 35,000 tonnes of materials were collected at these temporary facilities over the period 2006 to 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3878">The operation of these temporary facilities proved so popular with farmers that the IFFPG have now developed a calendar of some 130 collections nationwide where farmers can deposit bale wrap and silage wrap, at a reduced weight-based charge.  These collections have commenced and run through to the autumn of this year.  Farmyard collections are still available from IFFPG but they are more expensive to operate and consequently involve a higher charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_3889">The Minister for Health &amp; Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency. It is a matter for the FSAI to ensure that appropriate checks are carried out and any breaches of food labelling legislation should be reported to the FSAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_3890">I understand from FSAI that all agencies concerned check on compliance with labelling legislation in the course of their routine inspections of food premises. There is a commitment to enforce the regulations by all the agencies concerned. For example:</p>
            <p eId="para_3891">In June 2007 the FSAI secured a conviction in the District Court against a food business operator for illegal labelling of food. Fines and expenses totalling over €18,000 were imposed and,</p>
            <p eId="para_3892">In March 2008 a food business operation pleaded guilty to charges made by South Dublin Co. Council for breaches of general beef labelling legislation. While applying the Probation Act the District Judge required the food business operator to make a donation of €12,000 to the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and awarded €1,500 expenses to the Council.</p>

In this context, energy constitutes a significant and rising input cost and it is in the interest of all farmers, and indeed other competitive sectors, to manage such costs efficiently and to limit use where possible.  My Department has baseline data on greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture, including fuel usage, and it is worth noting that in recent years the sector has achieved significant production efficiencies which have kept emissions per unit of food as low as possible.  My Department and Teagasc will continue to assist and support the agriculture sector in pursuing such efficiencies. My Department will also continue to encourage farmers to plant forestry and energy crops, which have such an important role to play in the achievement of Ireland's renewable energy targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_3934">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.

            <p eId="para_3935">Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 624 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 23 mainstream class teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3937">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.

            <p eId="para_3945">The school referred to by the Deputy initially applied for an extension and refurbishment project.  This application was assessed and was assigned a band two rating under the band rating system operated by my Department.  The long-term projected enrolment for the school was originally assessed at 500 and a schedule of accommodation was drawn up and agreed on this basis. However, the current enrolment is 441. This figure represents a 5% decline on the enrolment of 466 in 2003.  In light of the trend in enrolments in the school in the past five years, the application is being reassessed to review the optimum solution to the school's needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3946">I am aware that the trustees of the school have entered into negotiations with a local landowner regarding the possible purchase of a site for use by the school.  The school has been in contact with my Department seeking a written commitment that its preferred option for the school is a new second level school on a greenfield site.  However, as the Deputy will understand, it would not be prudent for my Department to give any such open-ended commitment which would, in effect, limit the Department's scope for manoeuvre in the future regarding the optimum solution for secondary school services in east Clare. My Department will continue to assess the needs of St. Joseph's and the east Clare region generally and progress on any building projects will be considered in the context of the resources available under the multi-annual building programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3947">The final decision on the most appropriate solution to the accommodation needs of the area will include consideration of the possibility of building a new school on any suitable sites that are available in the area.  However, this option will only be implemented if it results in the optimum solution for the school and the area and provides value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a Principal and 2 mainstream class teaching posts.  This is based on an enrolment of 72 pupils at 30 September 2006.  The school also secured an additional mainstream class teacher for the 2007-08 school year under developing school criteria resulting in staffing of Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.</p>

The Board of Management of the school is therefore entitled to appoint one additional mainstream class teacher for the 2008-09 school year.  The Board of Management submitted an application for an additional post under developing school criteria for the school year 2008-09.

With regard to guidelines on discipline in schools, Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  The school Principal is required, before registering a child in the school, to provide the child's parents with a copy of the Code of Behaviour and may, as a condition of registering the child, require his or her parents to confirm in writing that the Code is acceptable to them and that they will make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the child will comply with the code.  Guidelines for drawing up codes of Behaviour are currently being distributed to all schools by the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB).

Band 1 projects address the needs of schools in rapidly developing areas, the provision of specialist accommodation for special needs pupils, schools with structural issues and rationalisation projects.  Band 2 projects address the needs of schools that have a deficit of mainstream accommodation and/or require refurbishment.  Band 3 projects address the needs of schools that have no deficit of mainstream accommodation but that have a deficit of ancillary accommodation.  Band 4 projects address the needs of schools that have desirable but not urgent needs.  When it is necessary to select projects from within the same band, as a general principle, projects will be selected on the basis of enrolment stability; projects that have been the longest period in the planning process and the most cost effective solution.  In this regard, it should be noted that a project's banding, or classification, can be subject to reassessment having regard to demographic developments in the area served by the school and also, for example, if on foot of a technical examination of the school it was found that the proposed project put forward by the school was not an appropriate design solution to meet the accommodation requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_3970">Demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  In considering the need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years, my Department has prioritised putting the extra teachers into schools as soon as possible.  This in many cases meant that the quickest way of providing accommodation was through prefabricated units.  Where it was possible to provide permanent accommodation, this was done by using the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, for example.  While the ideal solution is to provide permanent accommodation, where this is not possible, modern prefabricated units conform to health and safety regulations and are suitable for use as school accommodation in Ireland.  Against this background, my Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary accommodation low.  When the rental and purchase of temporary accommodation is taken together, it still only comes to 6.2% of overall investment in school buildings last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3980">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 233 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007-08 school year is a Principal and 9 mainstream class teachers.  According to data submitted by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2007 was 229 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department’s website, <i>www.education.ie</i>, and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008-09 school year will be a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3981">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) on my Department's website.  The school referred to by the Deputy lodged an appeal with the Primary Staffing Appeal Board.  The appeal was heard at the Appeal Board meeting on 20 May 2008 and was unsuccessful.  The Board of Management of the school was notified in writing of the decision of the Appeal Board on 22 May 2008.

            <p eId="para_3983">In general, individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, under Safety, Health and Welfare at Work legislation for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care.  It is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools.  The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils.  The Safety Statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.  In practical terms, individual school authorities are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety requirements.  My Department is working with the Health and Safety Authority and the State Claims Agency  to develop a health and safety management system to support post-primary schools in meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  This work forms part of a wider initiative to reduce the administrative burden on post-primary schools by supporting them in preparing policies to meet a range of legislative and regulatory requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3984">Eight such policies have been published to date.  They are available on the Department's website, <i>www.education.gov.ie</i>.  The Department takes great care to ensure that all health and safety requirements are incorporated into new school buildings and extensions.  The Department ensures that its technical guidance documentation takes cognisance of all health and safety legislation to inform Design Teams of their obligations in this area when designing building projects.  Provision is built into the School Building and Modernisation Programme to enable schools to address urgent health and safety problems.  Over €27 million was paid out to primary schools throughout the country in 2007 under the Minor Works Grant to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.  Individual primary schools received a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3985">The Summer Works Scheme, which was introduced in 2004, provides capital grants for small scale refurbishment works at primary and post-primary schools.  Responsibility for the delivery of the projects is entirely devolved out to the schools and their design teams.  The scope of works covered under this scheme is intended to address Health and Safety issues in all schools as well as improvement works to the existing fabric of the buildings.  Since 2004, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of €300 million have been completed.  With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008.  Accordingly, there is no Summer Works Scheme for 2008. However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3991">The Department's report on school retention, which was published on 31 March 2008, is based on a detailed analysis of the records held in the Post-Primary Pupils Database for the cohort of entrants to the first year of the junior cycle in 1999.  The report is available on the Department's website, <i>www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/pp_retention_1999_report.pdf</i>.  It must be noted that the figures refer to retention in State-aided second level schools only and do not include students progressing to further training and education at Junior or Leaving Certificate level, such as Youthreach courses, FÁS schemes, apprenticeship training as well as students in private, non-aided colleges at second level.  The report shows that the national retention rate to completion of the Junior Certificate examination is 94.6%.  The retention rate to completion of the Junior Certificate examination by county is given in table 5 of the report.  The Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their full potential and participate fully in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3992">Steps designed to improve school attendance include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002, under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, with a remit to monitor school attendance, help parents to get a school place for their child and run promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, one of the functions of the Board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it.  The Board has finalised the development of Guidelines for schools on developing Codes of Behaviour and work is commencing on the development of Guidelines on Attendance Strategies for Schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3993">Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central to DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion, which is being implemented at present in 873 schools comprising 670 primary schools (338 urban/town schools and 332 rural schools) and 203 second-level schools.  A key objective of this action plan is to enhance integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and between all other relevant Government departments, agencies, organisations and groups.  Under DEIS, my Department, through the network of ten regional offices is enhancing its capacity to work in partnership with locally based agencies and individuals promoting social inclusion measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3994">Measures under DEIS range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle attendance and early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community.  A key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving is the School Completion Programme.  This programme was implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and in line with current thinking favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process.  It entails targeting individual young people aged between four and 18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.  In addition the Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3995">In 2006 the National Behaviour Support Service was established.  A National Co-ordinator and five Assistant National Co-ordinators have been appointed.  In addition, ten Regional Development Officers and 14 part-time Associates were recruited to ensure the success of this significant initiative.  A Research Officer has been appointed and will carry out research of current Irish and international literature and test against reality situations in Irish schools.  This should provide an invaluable benchmark of the level of disruption in schools and the effectiveness of intervention by the NBSS.  A full-time administrator is based in Navan Education Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_3996">Since its appointment, the team has been working on a number of key issues, including the development of a Draft National Framework for Behaviour Improvement, the development of models of good practice for systems in schools which assist with and impact on classroom and whole school behaviour, ongoing training for the NBSS team and research into and communication with behaviour support systems in other jurisdictions.  The NBSS is working with 50 selected schools throughout the country.  Behaviour Support Classrooms have been established and staffed in 30 of these 50 schools.  These classrooms provide an individualised intensive intervention programme for a targeted group of students.  The Behaviour Support Classrooms are staffed by at least one qualified whole-time teacher.  The Board of Management of the schools concerned have flexibility in respect of the employment of another whole-time teacher equivalent and may employ people with different expertise to cater for the needs of the students involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">I emphasise that these classrooms cannot be, in themselves, a solution to the issue of poor student behaviour.  They must be one part of a holistic response which should see a school, actively supported by the Behaviour Support Team, defining for itself a pathway to improvement.  The NBSS also proposes to produce a training CD/DVD on all aspects of challenging behaviour, within the Irish context. It is envisaged that this would be available to all schools.  A key feature of the composition of the National Behaviour Support Service is the assignment to it of a team of four psychologists.  They have been seconded from the National Educational Psychological Service and their presence will ensure that the team operates in a multidisciplinary way.  These measures are a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk of poor attainment or of leaving school early.</p>

The particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas including Balbriggan, while also showing the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  The Department is making significant additional primary school places available in Balbriggan for September 2008 via delivery of new school buildings for three existing schools.  I understand that due to site restrictions it would prove difficult to expand further the school to which the Deputy specifically refers.  However, the Department approved the provision of one additional mainstream classroom for September 2007 to cater for additional enrolments.  Greenfield provision for this school will be considered in the context of the additional provision being made in the area and the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_627">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4012">I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the recent survey conducted by the <i>Irish Independent</i> in conjunction with RTE on the issue of “cyber bullying”, through the use of the internet and mobile phones.  I share the Deputy’s concern that any child would feel upset in school because of bullying — be it physical, verbal or what is being termed “cyber bullying”.  I assure him that supports are in place to enable schools to prevent bullying and to deal with cases that may arise.  There is no requirement for schools to report incidents of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case.  Accordingly, I am unable to provide the Deputy with details of cases of cyber bullying as requested.  It is unreasonable to expect schools to have a sole responsibility for tackling it, as responsibility extends beyond the school and parents and young people themselves must take protective measures.  It is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.  I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years.  Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.  In view of the increasing demands which have been placed on schools as a result of statutory obligations and the requirement for policies in a range of areas, my Department has been working to ensure greater availability of guidelines and template policies to assist schools.  My Department has published policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying, on its website as part of its ongoing efforts in this regard.  The template documents are not prescriptive, but highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based on the key document, Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour.  However, it takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes.  Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_4014">The National Educational Welfare Board has developed further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  These guidelines have been informed by broad consultation.  The guidelines are being distributed to schools.  It is envisaged that implementation will commence in the next school year.  When schools have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the board's guidelines, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour.  This review will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in international best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour.  My Department, through the National Centre for Technology in Education has also developed Policy Guidelines and Advisory Notes for schools and parents which deal with the issues of internet and mobile phone bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_4015">I draw the Deputy's attention to the "Watch your Space" Internet safety campaign.  This campaign, which was launched in February 2007, seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line.  The key message of the campaign is " be creative, be yourself, but be in control".  The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, <i>www.watchyourspace.ie</i>, which has been developed by the National Centre Technology in Education.  The site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web.  A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.  This new initiative perfectly compliments the other NCTE safety activities that are already up and running successfully such as Webwise, SAFT and the Once projects.  The site offers invaluable help to those who may encounter cyber-bullying.  It advises them not to respond to bullying messages, as this will only make things worse, to keep a record of the message so the problem can be dealt with properly, to block the sender and to talk to someone in authority about what has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_4016">The NCTE provides ongoing advice and support to all schools.  It reminds them that they need to have an up-to-date Acceptable Usage Policy in operation to deal with use of the Internet.  Schools cannot be connected to the schools broadband network until they confirm that they have an Acceptable Usage Policy in place.  Within the school environment, access to social networking and computer based instant messaging services are blocked under current filtering arrangements, inherent in the Schools Broadband Network, to which 99% of schools have connected.  The NCTE provides advice on tackling cyber bullying on <i>www.ncte.ie</i> and on <i>www.webwise.ie</i>.  The NCTE works with the National Parents Councils on developing and promoting advice to parents.  The key Irish website for providing advice and guidance to schools, pupils and parents is <i>www.webwise.ie</i>, which has materials and resources for teachers and parents to assist children to develop safe on-line skills and a sense of responsibility about what to write and post on websites.  Working with the NPC (Primary) the NCTE has developed a seminar to advise parents on how to engage with their children’s on-line lives.  Since September 2007, over 100 seminars have been delivered in schools around the country.  The NCTE has 41 trainers throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4017">Internet safety is addressed by the NCTE in a range of courses offered to teachers under the programme of continuing professional development.  Over 10,000 places have been taken up by teachers on such courses.  Working with the Social Personal and Health Education Support Service, the NCTE has created an Internet safety teaching and learning programme, "Be Safe, Be Webwise".  It is targeted at Junior Certificate SPHE classes and was rolled out in Spring 2008.  Through the combined work of the Department, the NCTE and the NEWB, schools will have available to them extensive guidance to enable them fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this issue.  Dealing with bullying has been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.  I have stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not only having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with. The education of students in primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum.  SPHE is a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</p>

It will also allow work to commence on 150 devolved projects under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, which will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.  In the post-primary sector, construction work will be completed on 19 large-scale projects which will provide 2,400 permanent school places in 4 new schools and additional accommodation and refurbishment works in 15 schools that will benefit over 7,000 pupil attendees.  The capital envelope also allows for the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the school building programme, particularly in rapidly developing areas, as well as allowing projects to progress through architectural planning and design stages.

As part of the Programme for Government, a Developing Areas Unit was set up recently in my Department to focus on the school accommodation needs of rapidly developing areas, including Naas.  The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In this context, the status of all schools in Naas is being assessed.  The schools referred to by the Deputy will be included in this assessment.  As is the case with all large capital projects on hand within the Unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4043">The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 315 classes have been approved around the country at primary and post-primary level, including many in special schools.  Children in these classes benefit from having fully qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis, the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children and the Picture Exchange Communication System.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4044">My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Applied Behavioural Analysis, the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children and the Picture Exchange Communication System through the Special Education Support Service.  A recent initiative has been the expansion of this service to enable it to recruit a behavioural specialist support team, led by a person with a PhD in ABA.  My Department's ABA pilot scheme was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools.  Now that a national network of special classes catering specifically for children with autism is available in schools, new centres will not be brought into the pilot programme.  Since July 2007, my officials have met on a regular basis with a representative group in relation to the commitment in the current programme for Government to long-term funding for the centres that are in the ABA pilot scheme subject to agreement with my Department on standards that will enable them to be supported as primary schools for children with autism.  The discussions have been wide-ranging and have included curricular issues, funding and staffing.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the discussions are progressing well.  My Department is very anxious to finalise these discussions so that permanent arrangements can be put in place as soon as possible.  It has been agreed not to disclose the details of the discussions while they are ongoing.  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that I am not in a position to provide details of the discussions.</p>

However, from time to time, in the course of particular initiatives or Garda investigations, the monitoring of the movement of people out of the State at approved ports is undertaken.  When the Garda Síochána becomes aware that a Court Order has directed that a minor is not to leave the jurisdiction or attaches restrictions to such movement, relevant information is circulated to personnel engaged in the immigration process at approved ports with a view to appropriate action being taken if a breach of such order is detected.  Missing people, including minors and vulnerable adults, are reported at their local Garda Station, where investigations are conducted under the direction of the local Superintendent.  The records kept on missing people do not indicate whether their subjects were, or were not, seeking asylum when they were reported missing.  Missing people investigations do not differentiate between subjects who are or are not asylum seekers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4076">The person concerned arrived in the State on 18 February 2001 with his father and was included under his application for asylum in the State.  However, he was taken into the care of the Health Service Executive in 2003 and subsequently applied for asylum in his own right on 8 March 2006.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 November 2006, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were received from the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4077">The person concerned also submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006), however this application was deemed invalid as it was not signed by the applicant.  The legal representative of the person concerned was notified of this by letter dated 15 December 2006 and was instructed to submit a signed form containing the signature of the person concerned.  The legal representative of the person concerned informed my Department by letter dated 20 November 2007 that the person concerned wished to withdraw his application for Subsidiary Protection.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_4079">The reason a member of An Garda Síochána seizes a passport varies depending on the circumstances under which the passport comes into their possession, e.g. on suspicion that a breach of the criminal law has been committed; for the purpose of deportation, etc.  Section 12 of the Immigration Act 2004 places an obligation on non-nationals to produce to a member of An Garda Síochána, on demand, a valid passport or other equivalent document, issued by or on behalf of an authority recognised by the Government, which establishes his or her identity and nationality.  If a member of An Garda Síochána suspects that a document produced to him or her in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004 is potentially evidence of the commission of a criminal offence he or she may take possession of the document.  If the document concerned is a passport, it is in fact the property of the authority which has issued it.  If, on examination, a seized document is found to be genuine and is not stolen or otherwise considered to be of evidential value in the investigation of a criminal offence, it will be returned to the person to whom it was issued.  Otherwise it will be retained as potential evidence in a criminal prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_4080">If a non-national has made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, his or her passport will be forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner who will retain it pending consideration of the application.  If a member of An Garda Síochána intends to engage in the removal of a non-national from the State pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of the Immigration Act 2003 or section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999, the surrender of a passport or travel document in the possession of the non-national may be required.  If a member of An Garda Síochána takes possession of a passport or other travel document which he or she intends to retain, a receipt will issue to the person concerned which will identify the member of An Garda Síochána taking possession of same.  If a person from whom a passport is seized is removed from the State, the document concerned will be handed to the immigration authority in the jurisdiction to which the person is removed.</p>

Additional Garda patrols, including patrols by the District patrol car, District Detective and Drug Units, the Community Policing Unit and the Mountain Bike Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel, have been directed to pay particular attention to this area, with a view to ensuring a visible Garda presence.  I am also informed that the CCTV system referred to by the Deputy is maintained by Dublin City Council and is in working order.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property and drug-related crime, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. Specific initiatives and special operations are put in place when analysis of criminal behaviour and crime trends indicate that such measures are necessary. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4118">Long term residency was introduced by way of an administrative scheme in May 2004. The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a deportation order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I.

         the mechanisms in place to protect children from offensive, age inappropriate or dangerous multimedia activities that are easily accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4127">Protection of children from the inappropriate use of multimedia activities is a very broad and encompassing term, but I take it that the Deputy is referring particularly to the internet, video games and mobile phones.  I have no function in the regulation of broadcast media or phones but I can inform him as to the child protection arrangements in place in respect of a number of other media formats.</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">I am very aware of the concerns of parents, teachers and voluntary organisations regarding the content available to children via the internet. The recent establishment of the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) as an executive office within my Department will continue to build on the work of the Internet Advisory Board which was set up in 2002 following the Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful use of the Internet.   The OIS will oversee and further develop the self-regulatory regime for the Irish internet service providers, encourage best practice procedures; promote awareness of the internet downside issues and provide advice and facilitate research on internet related issues regarding child safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">The OIS will also continue to oversee the operation of the Hotline (www.hotline.ie — the system for dealing with reports of illegal content on the internet). The Hotline is funded by the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan.  It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the internet.  It plays an important part by accepting reports, providing the resources to validate them and channelling those that are illegal directly to the appropriate jurisdiction and authority.  If the material is hosted in Ireland, it will request the relevant Internet Service Provider (ISP) to remove it, in accordance with their Code of Practice and Ethics.   Special protocols operate between the Gardaí and the Hotline that maximise cooperation on law enforcement issues.  The Hotline provides a first port of call for parents and members of the public in general who encounter illegal material on the internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_4130">You may be aware of the booklets in the GET with IT! Series on behalf of the Internet Advisory Board (IAB). There are three booklets in the series,  a parents' guide to new media technologies, a parents' guide to filtering technologies and a parents' guide to social -networking websites. These booklets give an overview of new technologies, help parents to understand and use websites and help them to safeguard their children online.  Copies of these publications were distributed widely and can be had on request through a freefone number 1800 24 25 95. They are also available on the website of my Department at &lt;www.justice.ie&gt;.</p>
            <p eId="para_4131">With regard to video games, the position is that Ireland is a member of the Pan European Games Information (PEGI) system.  Video games are classified by age appropriateness at the following levels; 3+: 7+ 12+; 15+ and 18+.  The categorisation is then indicated on product packaging.  Under these arrangements, video games are categorised according to a robust and consistent system and subject to independent non-industry verification.</p>
            <p eId="para_4132">A key component of video game arrangements is that the classification systems are designed to provide useful information as to the content of the product.  In particular, the intention is to assist parents in making informed choices concerning the media they acquire for their children or which they permit their children to use.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">In so far as films and videos/DVDs are concerned, the position is that these must be classified by the Irish Film Censor for sale, exhibition or rental.  The age appropriateness of each work is then displayed in cinema and all video/DVD works must carry the age classification on the packaging and video/DVD.</p>

            <p eId="para_4135">I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 30 April 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 8 members of An Garda Síochána assigned to community policing duties in the Mayo Division, four (4) in Ballina and four (4) in Castlebar.  There were also 2 Juvenile Liaison Officers attached to the Mayo Division based in Ballina and Castlebar Garda stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">While these are the numbers of Gardaí specifically assigned to community policing, it is also of course the case that all Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues. The Garda Commissioner, who is responsible for the prioritisation and allocation of resources within the Force, is currently reviewing arrangements within An Garda Síochána for community policing.  I look forward to the outcome of the review and receiving the Commissioner's proposals for the future development of community policing in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">As regards the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, it has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which operate separately from the Programme.  These Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">At present, there are 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects operating throughout the country.  Of these projects, there are two operating in County Mayo; Youth Action Ballina (YAB) and Castlebar Youth Action Project (YAC).  The number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects established nationwide will be extended to 168 during the lifetime of the government, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government.</p>

Significant departures from the average processing time occur only when further, more detailed enquiries are required in specific instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">In order to meet the increased demand arising since 2006 from the ongoing major expansion in the provision of its vetting service, the GCVU has been in receipt of very significant additional resources. In particular, the human resource allocation to the Unit has increased from 13 originally to its current level of more than 60, with new personnel joining the Unit in each of the first three months of this year.

One of the stated conditions of her permission to remain in the State is that the person concerned accept that the granting of permission to remain does not confer any entitlement or legitimate expectation on any other person, whether related to her or not, to enter the State.  The entitlement of family reunification in this State is limited to the circumstances provided for in Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended).

            <p eId="para_4176">The facility in question is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan for which the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts. Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act, 1996 precludes the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority of a function conferred on it under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_4177">In view of the project's status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department was involved in certifying that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy on the procurement of infrastructure in this way. The Department by letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the project, that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process there was no objection to Dublin City Council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner. My Department and the National Development Finance Agency had representation on the project board established to manage the procurement process. The project board did not have a role in regard to the contractual arrangements subsequently entered into by Dublin City Council. My Department is not a party to this contract and has no further role in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4178">The Minister for Finance in his response, in April 2007, to the recommendations in the Committee of Public Accounts report took the view that this recommendation would need to be considered by the relevant sponsoring agency on a case by case basis, having regard to protecting the State's negotiating position and the statutory, civil and legal rights of contracting parties. He also noted that all of the PPP documentation and analyses are available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
            <p eId="para_4179">In the case of this project Dublin City Council is the relevant sponsoring agency and the Council has not made any proposal to my Department to release the Public Sector Benchmark.  My Department is aware that independent statutory processes are still in progress in regard to the project and any issues which arise in that context with implications for the contract are a matter for Dublin City Council.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_4196">The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Act, 2002 provided, inter alia, the statutory basis for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) to administer a radon remediation grant scheme in respect of houses from moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas.  Such a scheme could require significant public expenditure and administrative resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4197">It would be difficult for a demand led scheme of domestic radon grants to ensure appropriate and cost effective targeting of remedial action.  Therefore, the Government's approach, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is that our efforts are better concentrated on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_4198">The Government, largely through the RPII, has, for many years now, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country, and to increasing public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations.   The Building Regulations introduced by my Department in 1998 and up-dated in 2004 also require all new buildings, including new houses, to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_4199">Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by the Department, titled Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is available on the Department's website. The RPII has also issued guidance entitled Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide.  This is available on the RPII website, as is a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_4278">The information requested in relation to the number of schools which are metered for water charges is not available in my Department.  However, the metering of all non-domestic water users, including schools, is expected to be completed before the end of 2008.  Water charging of non-domestic users on a volumetric basis should incentivise efficiency and conservation in the use of water, thereby reducing the running costs of non-domestic users generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_4279">Following on from a commitment in the Programme for Government in relation to school water charges, the Government decided on 4 January 2008 to introduce transitional arrangements for charging schools for water services, pending full cost from 1 January 2010.  The transitional arrangements, involving a flat rate charge per pupil for water services, are the basis on which schools are to be charged for water services for the years 2007 to 2009.  However, if actual usage, as recorded by a meter, produces a lower charge than the flat rate, the lower bill will apply for the transition period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4280">In the context of full cost recovery being applicable from 1 January 2010, local authorities have been asked to provide all schools with periodic indicative bills showing the volume of water supplied in the specified period and the associated full cost charge. Those schools with abnormally high water consumption are to be identified and contacted with advice on the necessity to implement measures to reduce water usage.  Details of those schools are also to be supplied to the Department of Education and Science.  This should assist schools in preparing for the transition to full volumetric billing in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_4282">The Planning Code provides for extensive public notification of proposed development. It is a general requirement that a valid application for planning permission must be advertised by site notice and newspaper notice. The site notice must state, inter alia, that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority, and that submissions or observations in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing on payment of the prescribed fee within the 5 week period beginning on the date of the receipt by the planning authority of the application. A notice of the proposed development must also be published in an approved local or national newspaper. This must, in addition, set out details in relation to the inspection of planning applications and the making of submissions and observations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4283">Ordinarily an appeal on a decision of a planning authority can be made only by the applicant, or an individual or group who made submissions or observations in writing to the planning authority in relation to the planning application in accordance with permission regulations. However, an exception is provided for persons with an interest in land adjoining the site which is the subject of the application. Section 37(6)(a) of the 2000 Act provides that a landowner/occupier on the site adjoining the application site may apply to the Board for leave to appeal the decision of the planning authority, within four weeks of the decision, even without having made submissions or observations to the planning authority in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4284">It is also possible for an individual to apply to the High Court for leave to seek a judicial review of a planning decision.  Leave must usually be sought within eight weeks of the decision, and the High Court may only grant leave where it is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or should be quashed.  The person seeking leave must also have a substantial interest in the decision and have participated in the decision making process or had good and sufficient reasons for not doing so.  While I have no proposals before me at the moment, I will keep the position under review to ensure that planning notice requirements are both effective and cost efficient.</p>

            <p eId="para_4292">Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4293">In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  The Minister has no statutory function in the determination of waivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4294">It is recognised that significant regulatory issues have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years. These issues, which have been the subject of a formal public consultation, include the need for appropriate reflection of necessary public service criteria in relation to the provision of services in particular areas or in respect of specific households. The existing regulatory framework requires modernisation. The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the recent OECD review of the public service, which included a specific case study on waste management, and will be implemented in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy provided for in the Programme for Government and now being initiated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4295">The revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste collection services and infrastructure provision, whether delivered by the private or public sectors. In these contexts the appropriate policy responses will be developed and elaborated.</p>

            <p eId="para_4310">Under the provisions of section 25 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986, the District Court may act on a complaint by any person where a nuisance has been created by excessive barking by a dog. A copy of the Form used for complaints to the Courts regarding barking is available from local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4311">While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt with under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a legal remedy has been provided under Article 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994.   This allows an individual, a group of residents, a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to make a complaint to the District Court in respect of noise which gives reasonable cause for annoyance, for the purpose of obtaining an Order for the reduction, prevention or limitation of the noise.  The defendant is obliged to comply with any such Order.</p>

            <p eId="para_4318">A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  The last assessment took place in 2005 and indicated that there were 43,684 households on local authority housing waiting lists.  Detailed information on this assessment is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.  This information on housing need, broken down by housing authority, has been a major consideration in the allocation of exchequer resources for the national social housing investment programme.  This year alone, my Department has allocated a record €1 billion to support construction and acquisitions projects across the country.  Local authorities are currently carrying out the 2008 statutory housing needs assessment, the results of which will be published in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">At present, the placement of applicants on housing waiting lists and the subsequent allocation of social housing units is a matter for each housing authority in accordance with its scheme of letting priorities.  However, under the social housing reform agenda, as set out in the Government's Housing Policy Statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, there is a commitment to the reform of housing allocation policy.  Proposals for a new allocation policy have been developed by my Department, in consultation with the County and City Managers' Association, and have been discussed and endorsed by the Housing Forum.  The aims of these policy reforms are to improve consistency and transparency in decision making, to provide a better fit between needs and resources and to respond, as far as possible, to the expressed preferences of individual households.  The necessary legislative support will be included in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is currently being drafted.</p>

            <p eId="para_4321">Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency. The Agency's most recent report on Air Quality in Ireland, published in October 2007, contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality, and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA. Monitoring in 2006 showed that air quality in Ireland is good and complied with the air quality standards in force for all pollutants. In addition there has been a significant downwards trend for major pollutants well below the standards with the exception of some mainly vehicular related emissions.  I am keeping the position under close review and in this regard I look forward to receiving the 2007 Air Quality Report in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_4322">A key indicator from my Department's Statement of Strategy 2008 — 2010 is progress in addressing emissions of transboundary air pollutants and maintaining high air quality standards.  Accordingly, my Department has in place ongoing relevant initiatives and programmes, including the National Emissions Reduction Plan, a Voluntary Agreement with the Solid Fuel Trade Group, currently under review, and the recent introduction of Sulphur Content of Heavy Fuel Oil, Gas Oil, and Marine Fuels Regulations, 2008.  In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to expand the network of air quality monitoring stations, my Department will also shortly undertake a review of the existing network in consultation with the EPA.</p>

            <p eId="para_4360">I am providing some €999.2m in general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund to local authorities for 2008. These grants are my contribution to meet the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing an acceptable level of day-to-day services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants. The amount being made available for these grants this year represents an increase of some €51.5m or 5.4% over the amount provided for 2007 and continues the trend of providing additional general funding to local authorities through the Local Government Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_4361">Kildare County Council's general purpose grant allocation for 2008 is €28,176,862, an increase of 6.42% over the 2007 allocation and is above the national average increase for 2008.  General purpose grants to Kildare County Council have increased by some 224% since 1997, which is also well above the national average increase of 195% in the same period. There are no additional resources available to me to increase general purpose funding to local authorities this year.  I am satisfied that the general purpose grant allocation I have provided to the Council for 2008, together with the income available to it from other sources, will enable it to provide an acceptable level of services to its customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4366">National waste statistics for all waste streams are published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the most recent National Waste Report being in respect of the year 2006.  The following progress has been made in regard to waste recovery and recycling in the municipal waste stream in Ireland: the quantity of municipal waste (i.e. household and commercial waste) managed amounted to 3,100,310 tonnes in 2006 of which 1,980,618 tonnes was consigned to landfill with the remaining 1,119,692 tonnes sent for recovery, equating to an overall national recovery rate of 36.1%.  In effect, our national target of 35% set for 2013 in the Government policy statement Changing Our Ways has been exceeded almost seven years ahead of schedule; household waste accounted for 1,773,246 tonnes of the municipal waste stream of which 1,379,246 tonnes was landfilled with 393,995 tonnes (22.2%) reported as being recovered in 2006.  A significant challenge remains to achieve our national diversion target of 50% by 2013 as set in Changing Our Ways; a national recovery rate of 54.7% was reported for commercial waste with 725,697 tonnes recovered and the remaining 601,372 tonnes deposited to landfill.  This represents a 5.3% increase in recovery on the 2005 figures; 57.3% or 589,519 tonnes of packaging waste was recovered in 2006 indicating that Ireland continues to exceed its 50% target required under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste and is well on the way to achieving its mandatory 60% target required by end 2011 under the amending Directive 2004/12/EC.  A total of 438,952 tonnes of packaging waste was consigned to landfill in 2006; recovery operators reported that circa 28,000 tonnes of packaging waste was exported for use as a fuel in 2006; a total of 866,969 tonnes (38%) of biodegradable municipal waste was recovered in 2006 with the balance of 1,412,581 tonnes disposed of to landfill.  Under the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) Ireland must restrict the landfill of biodegradable municipal waste to no more than 967,433 tonnes by 2010 and to no more than 451,469 tonnes by 2016.  The roll-out of the "brown bin" will play a key role in diverting substantial volumes of organic waste from landfill to facilitate the achievement of the challenging targets under Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_4367">The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead.  It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, reuse and recycling of  waste.  This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.  This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the Landfill Directive to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">To assist the process of ensuring that our waste management system can act in support of these objectives my Department is currently initiating a major review of waste management policy as set out in the Programme for Government.  The review will chart a new way forward.  Given the need to accelerate movement away from landfill quite dramatically, we need to examine all the technologies that can contribute to optimising our environmental performance in relation to waste.  The review will be designed, in addition, to support the necessary legal, institutional and policy framework to achieve international best practice in the management of our waste.  If the outcome of the review indicates a need for significant legislative changes I will bring the necessary proposals to Government in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4377">I propose to take Questions Nos. 480 and 482 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4378">I launched the Pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme last month with a budget of €5 million for 2008.  The Scheme, which is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), is designed to incentivise homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their homes thus reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.  The Pilot Scheme is primarily aimed at older housing stock which is likely to be most in need of energy efficiency retrofitting.  Clusters or groups of households are also included in the pilot Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4379">The Pilot Scheme will operate this year in three geographical areas — North Tipperary, Dundalk Sustainable Energy Zone and Counties Clare and Limerick (excluding Limerick City).  The fourth module of the Scheme will not be restricted to any particular area and will focus on clustered households.  Participating households will be assigned a Building Energy Rating (BER) assessor, which will provide a BER rating on the house and advise on the works that need to be carried out to improve its energy efficiency.  The householder will pay a €100 contribution towards the cost of the BER assessment.  The advice will relate to attic insulation, interior or exterior wall insulation, low-emissivity double-glazing, heating controls and a range of other energy efficient works.  The Pilot Scheme will measure the impact of providing capital grant incentives in three of the four areas.  In the Dundalk Zone it is planned to measure the impact of the availability of green loans from financial institutions to incentivise investment by householders. SEI is undertaking the pilot scheme in partnership with Local Energy Agencies and Local Authorities.  There are no restrictions on eligibility for the Pilot Scheme, other than the geographical boundaries of the three pilot areas.  However, if more applications under the four modules are received than can be accommodated, a form of selection process will be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_4380">Preliminary estimates from SEI show that a household participating in the pilot scheme could save up to €500 in energy bills every year as a result of the energy efficiency investments undertaken.  The pilot scheme is expected to result in reduced CO2 emissions of 6,000 tonnes per year, while the full €100 million scheme envisaged in the Programme for Government could be expected to yield CO2 savings of 175,000 tonnes per year.  Decisions in relation to the roll-out of a national Scheme will be made in light of the Pilot Scheme and overall budgetary considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4381">The Warmer Homes Scheme has been in operation for a number of years and provides support to low income households for insulation and other energy efficiency improvement measures.  The scheme administered by SEI and is currently being implemented by 18 community groups.  Eligible homes are identified locally via networks drawn from the statutory and voluntary sector.  Eligibility criteria are determined locally and can vary from one area to another.</p>

            <p eId="para_4383">Following scientific research, conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the European Council introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.

            <p eId="para_4396">Under the Programme for Government we are committed to the implementations in full of the National Bioenergy Action Plan for Ireland. The Plan sets a range of actions and targets to 2020 for the sustainable development of Ireland's bioenergy potential. The cumulative effect of these actions over the period has the potential to deliver reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 2 million tonnes per annum by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4397">In the electricity sector there is now over 1,100 Mega Watts of renewable generation capacity connected to the grid and over 9 per cent of electricity is being generated from renewable sources. Ireland is on course to exceed the 33% target for electricity from renewable energy by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4398">The 2010 target of 5% renewable share in the heating sector will be met, primarily as a result of the Greener Homes Scheme and the commercial Renewable Heat Programme, and we have set a further target of 12% renewable share in the heating sector for 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_4399">In relation to the sustainable deployment of biofuels in the transport sector, progressive delivery on the 8.75% target for 2010 is being supported through the biofuels excise relief scheme. Our biofuels target for 2010 and 2020 will be further underpinned by the introduction of the Biofuels Obligation which will be the subject of public consultation shortly and which will take full account of EU developments in relation to biofuel sustainability.</p>

         if he will compare the average price of diesel at present with the average price of diesel in May 2007; the reason for the hike in price; his plans to reduce the price in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4401">I have no function in relation to controlling the price of oil, diesel or petrol.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market.  Prices at the pump reflect market factors such as global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4402">The Competition Authority is a statutory independent body with specific responsibility for the enforcement of competition law.  The National Consumer Agency has specific statutory responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.  Both have responsibility for ensuring that competition works optimally for the benefit of consumers throughout the country.  EU price figures published on 19th May, 2008, show that the average price of diesel in Ireland in April was €1.248 per litre.  The corresponding figure for April published in May 2007 was €1.072 per litre.</p>
            <p eId="para_4403">Traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol in Ireland at the forecourts.  This was due to the fact that the international prices for both products were at a similar level, and excise duty is lower on diesel.  The excise differential in favour of diesel is 7.46 cents.  The international price of diesel is determined by supply and demand, and the increase in demand for diesel which is taking place both within Europe and in China and other rapidly-developing economies world-wide, has pushed up the international price for diesel above the price of petrol.  The increase in the demand for diesel has led to a shortage in European refineries, and diesel is now being sourced from farther afield, particularly from Russia.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) has also reported that US refiners have been producing substantially more petrol than usual and domestic US stocks are very high.  These factors are likely to have curbed flows of exports of petrol from Europe to the US, leaving Northwest European petrol stocks above average.  The combination of all of these market factors has contributed to the rise in European diesel prices relative to petrol.</p>
