          <p eId="para_7">It is proposed to take No. 8, motion re proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, back from committee; No. 8<i>a</i>, Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 — allocation of time motion for select committee; No. 8<i>b</i>, Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 — Financial Resolutions; No. 21, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 — Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. 22, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2008 — Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; and No. 20, Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 — Second Stage (resumed).</p>
          <p eId="para_8">It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 8, 8<i>a</i> and 8<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate.  In the case of No. 8<i>b</i>, Financial Resolutions Nos. 1 to 30 shall be moved together and decided by one question which will be put from the Chair.  The proceedings of the resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 21 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m. today by one question, which will be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">The time allocation motion has only come to my notice now.  Effectively, the allocation the Tánaiste is proposing is putting in the first three hours of the debate, which is to run for perhaps 16 hours, most of the things that would be of interest to the committee to tease out.  I suggest that fewer sections should be dealt with in the first three hours of debate and that time should be made available to debate sections that otherwise would be guillotined under the allocation of time motion before they are reached.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I am opposed to guillotining this matter.  The unemployment figures published yesterday show projections for an unemployment rate of up to 12% by the end of next year and into 2010.  Is there any intention to further amend this Bill, for example, to facilitate employers who take on new employees next year, so that they will not have to pay PRSI for 2009?  As I have often said before, I am opposed to the principle of a guillotine.</p>

As Deputy Gilmore has indicated, only 11 of 45 amendments have been addressed at this point.  Clearly, these matters are of great importance, so the opportunity should be afforded to all Members to engage properly on the amendments they have tabled.

          <p eId="para_158">I have three questions for the Tánaiste.  Yesterday morning the Minister for Finance gave a strong hint that the national pay deal may be renegotiated.  The Taoiseach, in his response to questions here yesterday, said a conclusion would be arrived at in negotiation with social partnership and last night a statement was issued from the Government.  The Government is all over the place on this and there is no clarity on the position.  Without using jargon, will the Tánaiste say if the national pay deal is set in stone or is up for renegotiation?</p>

          <p eId="para_161">The Bill dealing with the withdrawal of medical cards was dealt with by Government on Tuesday and I understand it will be in the House next week.  What are the projected savings of this legislation on the withdrawal of the medical card from over-70s and what is the impact of the deferral of the measure until 1 March 2009, as announced yesterday?</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Taoiseach has briefed, or is in the process of briefing, every leader in Europe on the Government intentions with regard to the Lisbon treaty.  There is little point in coming to leaders of the Opposition the day before he goes off to speak to the Heads of Government about his intentions at the Council meeting.  In the context of legislation, does the Government intend to bring forward legislation giving effect to the holding of a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I wish to raise a related matter, namely, the Tánaiste's responsibility for putting through employment law.  Incidentally, this is where Deputy Kelleher comes in as well.  An horrific "Prime Time Investigates" programme was broadcast this week that outlined the degree of exploitation of workers.  I was particularly concerned about the stories presented about people driving trucks for long hours, without breaks and so on.  For Deputy Kelleher's information, there is a pile of legislation in this regard.  Although the Employment Law Compliance Bill was published nine months ago, it still has not appeared before the House.  If the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for labour affairs has nothing better to do, he might try to secure some time from the Chief Whip and bring it before the House.  The Employment Law Compliance Bill is intended to put the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, on a statutory basis in order that it can check and inspect such trucks that are being driven around by people who are overworked and exhausted and so on.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_215">There are other similar items, namely, an employment agency regulation Bill and an industrial relations amendment Bill, neither of which have yet been published.  The Tánaiste should indicate when this legislation will be brought before the House and when will it be published.  If the Minister of State who has direct responsibility for these matters would like to assist the Tánaiste in her reply, I would have no objection to that either.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Another issue I wish to raise pertains to the promise by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, to place a cap or limit on expenditure in local elections.  He announced this measure some time ago and I suggested to the Taoiseach that the opportunity should be taken to use the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to bring this forward.  In fairness to the Taoiseach, he replied that he thought this was a good idea and indicated that the requisite amendments might be brought forward on Committee Stage of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  However, Committee Stage has come and gone and the amendments were not made.  While the Report Stage debate is due for consideration today, no Report Stage amendments have been tabled by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce a cap on spending limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not often seen in this House.  I am beginning to wonder what he is for.  He could not stop the motorway from going through Tara or the incinerator in his own constituency and apparently, he now is unable to get through Cabinet a simple measure he announced months ago to put a cap on expenditure on local elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">I am afraid it is out of order but I am sure, in addressing amendment No. 13, the Deputy can preface his comments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_452">It has been my experience on a number of occasions where a local authority increased rent payments that I have had to refer to a regulation by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which provides that the maximum increase on rent supplement payments is 15%.  This was the reason behind amendment No. 12.  I accept that the amendment has been ruled out of order but I ask that some sort of regulation be introduced to the Bill in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Amendment No. 13 deals with the large proportion of private sector rental accommodation of which account has not been taken.  In every local authority, hundreds or, in the case of cities, thousands of accommodation units are not yet registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  There is no mechanism, therefore, to make these landlords accountable.  In my area, applicants receive forms from their community welfare officers which are signed by the local authority before they proceed to seek accommodation.  There is no mechanism to allow for the inspection of the rental properties, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In regard to the rental sector, I am very annoyed by developers and builders who lease their properties while awaiting planning permission for further development.  The condition of these rental units leaves a lot to be desired.  I see examples of this practice every time I conduct house calls and during each election.  When I enter a street, I can nearly tick off the rented accommodation because in many cases the walls or gates are falling down and the houses are in poor repair.  It is rare that the occupants of these properties do not have something to report in regard to heating or cooking arrangements.  No mechanism appears to be available to hold people to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Amendment No. 13 will require that a landlord in respect of whose property rent supplement is paid must be registered with the PRTB.  The fee for registration is €75, which is a small sum, but at least it would allow us to determine whether the owner of a particular building is registered.  Subsequent legislation could ensure the protection of tenants.  The rental accommodation scheme is in place in a number of areas, which I welcome.  From my knowledge of the scheme, the accommodation is first class, well looked after and well documented with the local authority.  The payments are made from the local authority to the landlord and there is a mechanism available for the tenant to go to the local authority and ensure that if there is a problem with heating or other normal services, a link is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">This is not so with so many thousands of tenancies.  Some of this legislation relates directly to them.  The landlords in question will put the boot into the tenant because they look for payments under the counter.  They will tell the tenants to go the community welfare officer and say he or she is getting the facility for €100, for example, but they will ask for €20 or €30 under the counter when the tenants are accepted and not say anything else about it.  We have no mechanism in place for such payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Minister knows as well as I do, in her constituency as much as mine, that there is a tendency for people seeking accommodation to go over the top to try to get better accommodation.  It is normal to expect any family to try to look for the best accommodation but unfortunately, there are landlords who will try to be underhand.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">There are significant amounts of money involved in rent subsidies and related issues.  Some people would suggest that the community welfare officer could investigate such matters but it is impossible for such officers to find time to do so because of the workload they have.  The community welfare officers are not even able to cope with what they have.  In my area, a community welfare officer has been appointed to deal solely with rent subsidy in order to try to eliminate the backlog on what is there.  That is not feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">As a first step, the landlord in receipt of the rent subsidy payment should be registered.  It would be another box to be ticked on the application form but it would ensure that such landlords come on board, whether they like it or lump it.  As a result of the condition of some of the rented accommodation, it will not be possible to rent it to anybody except those who seek rent subsidy.  It is necessary to have another box on the application form to ensure the landlord is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board and if he or she is not, the payment should not be made.  In this regard we would try to improve the facilities for those unfortunate enough to have to seek the subsidy.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The rental accommodation scheme is the way forward as it is clean-cut and does much for the tenant.  It is a way around a landlord who is blackguarding many people around the country.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment as it would ensure that we have at least one step forward in getting the rogue landlord, who causes such decimation to family life by getting under-the-counter payments.  Such landlords do not put any effort into providing even partially acceptable conditions for those unfortunate enough to have to seek accommodation from them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_461">I support the amendment and the various amendments put down by the Labour Party on rent supplement.  My party has some of its own on the issue later so I will speak to it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">There are a number of considerations.  This amendment links the registration with that of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  I put down questions last week following Committee Stage to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, as with so many instances here, the first line of the response informed me that the Minister had no function in the matter as the operation of tenancy registration is the responsibility of the PRTB, an independent statutory body.  This immediately makes it more difficult to have effective co-operation between the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the PRTB.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">There are approximately 240,000 landlords registered with the PRTB.  It is frequently the landlords renting accommodation to somebody on social welfare who are not registered.  I am sure everyone in this House can cite so many instances of people coming into our clinics who are living in poor accommodation, who want to get local authority housing and get it based on their accommodation being so poor.  At the next clinic in the same area a new person will come in who is in the same accommodation and is seeking local authority housing based on the poor quality of their accommodation.  Along the way, these people have been on rent supplement in that poor quality accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">This is a vicious circle that costs the local authorities and the Minister's Department a lot of money.  The only way of dealing with it is if the rent supplement is linked to the PRTB.  The Minister will argue that she does not want to make the recipient of the rent supplement suffer but we are not doing these tenants any service by effectively forcing them into poor quality accommodation.  There is also an issue for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I agree with Deputy Wall in that the rental accommodation scheme is the way to go.  There is a fear among people that if they go into better quality accommodation through the scheme they will not be considered for local authority housing.  This is not the responsibility of the Minister alone but rather a case that needs interdepartmental co-operation, as well as input from State agencies.  The issue will not be solved by any one Minister.  There has been a little improvement in trying to ensure we sort it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Under-the-counter payments are common, although they are technically illegal.  Those in receipt of the rent supplement are only entitled to it if the accommodation is at a particular standard.  People are desperate when looking for housing and are willing in some instances to pay the landlord extra money per week because it may be the only housing available.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Another issue relating to payment links to the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  A Comptroller and Auditor General report indicated concern about the number of landlords getting rent supplement who are not paying tax on the properties being rented.  There must be better co-operation to ensure that issue is fully and adequately addressed.  This is one way of tracking it within the system so as to ensure tax is being paid.  It is difficult to do this with a private tenant, although it should still be done, but when the State is giving rent supplement there must be a mechanism to ensure that where the landlord is the ultimate recipient, he or she is paying tax on that money.  It does not always happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Another issue is the method of receipt for the supplement.  I asked the Minister on Committee Stage to consider the Focus Ireland submission as it was worthwhile.  It highlighted some of the difficulties that arise and the poverty traps that can ensue.  An interesting matter brought up by the submission, which has been raised here before, is the fact that if a person works for more than 30 hours per week, that person is ineligible for rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">That makes no sense and amounts to another poverty trap.  The issue should not be how many hours are worked but how much money is earned.  We spent much time yesterday debating activation for lone parents and this issue of rent supplement  is related.  If a trap is put in people's way — after 30 hours working they cannot get rent supplement regardless of how much money is brought in — it is not a logical way of doing business.  We should encourage these people to get employment.  The issue must be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_470">I support the amendment and would be delighted if the Minister would accept it.  We need a settled housing situation.  The difficulty relates to the large local authority housing waiting list of some 43,000 people.  However, local authorities cannot make that provision because they are grossly underfunded.  At Government level, upwards of €440 million per year is being spent on a housing rental scheme that gives the taxpayer little return on expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I accept that the overwhelming majority of landlords are responsible, but it is disappointing that they have not all registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB.  A serious push must be made to ensure that they register and Deputy Wall's amendment would go some way towards achieving this.  It would make for a better regulated rental market and might substantially lessen our grá to own our homes.  People would become more comfortable or settled in renting a home from free market landlords for their lifetimes.  We must review this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The culture of "cute hoorism" — I do not know whether that is parliamentary language — or of slippery characters must be rounded up.  It will take political courage initially to address the issue, but we must regularise the movers and shakers in towns or villages or on cities' edges.  The long-term benefits to society would be substantial.  The essence of the amendment would go some way towards ensuring that those landlords who are not behaving responsibly now do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The matter of social housing provision is a bad one, but everyone would agree that the primary issue is that of deposits.  A number of constituents present at my constituency offices looking for deposits because local authorities no longer give them to people who qualify for rent subsidy payments.  When they meet community welfare officers, CWOs, the officers shake their hands but do not supply deposits either.  I accept that it is difficult for local authorities currently strapped for cash — indeed, they have always been strapped for cash — to expend substantial sums of money that will lie in a landlord's bank account at the cost of funding for other local authority functions.  This unfortunate issue must be sorted out quickly.  Like me, Members from every side of the House deal with the people in question on an almost daily basis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_476">I strongly support amendment No. 13 on tying the payment of rent supplement to registration with the PRTB.  Linking them would be a sensible, progressive and caring way to help those in receipt of the rent supplement.  They need our support and that of society.  The majority are trying to get on with their lives against the odds.  Like Deputy Morgan, I have encountered many sad and lonely cases.  As legislators, we and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs have a statutory duty to protect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Some landlords are involved in this matter.  Of those I know, the majority treat their rent supplement tenants in a decent and caring way, but they are being done a disservice by the landlords exploiting the situation.  In recent weeks, I dealt with serious anti-social issues involving threats of violence against owners, neighbours and so on.  This side of the story must be addressed.  If tenants are misbehaving, they must be challenged about their behaviour, particularly if they are in receipt of taxpayers' money.  Given that we all have experience of similar situations, it is important to mention them.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Regarding the broader rent supplement issue, we must consider our housing policy.  While I was a councillor in Dublin City Council in 1999, a small number of fantastic projects to house senior citizens and rent supplement tenants were commenced and worked successfully.  A number of people in their 50s and early 60s were in receipt of rent supplement payments but had been on the housing list for flats in senior citizen complexes for seven or eight years.  This matter should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Councillors also encountered a number of quality rent supplement recipients living on their own who would have been ideal candidates to be placed in charge of senior citizen complexes in Donnycarney, Coolock or Marino in my constituency.  We must be creative.  Some people in receipt of the supplement are so talented or have so many skills that it is not good enough to leave them locked in their little bedsits on their own.  I encourage the Minister to consider imaginative ways to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In the past six months, the national and international economies have changed in terms of regulation.  Two years ago, "regulation" was a dirty word, but it is now the buzz word; regulation is the only game in town.  We must tie these issues together.  For example, the amendment states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_481">The landlord in receipt of a payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable of a tenant shall, as soon as practicable, submit to the Health Service Executive the registration details of the tenancy where registration is required by section 134 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">This is the important section, in that it calls for greater responsibility and clarity in the interests of the person in receipt of a rent supplement payment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_483">I apologise for being late.  I was attending a presentation.  I will briefly discuss the way in which we ensure that those to whom rent supplement is paid are tax compliant and that their accommodation is reasonable and good enough.  In recent months, most of us have been concentrating on putting staff in social welfare offices, given the fact that many people are becoming unemployed.  If community welfare officers are dealing with rent supplement payments, I assume that they are expected to keep tabs on the types of accommodation available and whether people are living where they should be.  They now deal with as many unemployed persons as they deal with in their usual cohort, if not more.  Despite the current delays in getting people their jobseekers benefit payments or their allowances, no additional personnel or support services have been placed in community welfare offices.  They are being overwhelmed.  They are no longer able to provide their previously good service.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I appeal to the Minister in respect of the rent supplement and so on.  The majority of the CWOs' work now relates to people who have become unemployed.  They must also deal with those people's applications for rent supplement payments and mortgage relief, but no additional supports or staff have been provided.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter seriously.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_485">Some 70,000 people are in receipt of rent supplement at present and the number is increasing.  The scheme relating to rent supplement gives people flexibility in the context of being able to move home.  It also assists people who do not have access to accommodation or who do not have the means to pay for such accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">There is no doubt that in the past some rented accommodation was of questionable quality.  The change in the economic climate has led to much more, and better quality, accommodation being available for rent.  The latter can only be to the benefit of tenants.  When one considers that the State will pay out €436 million of taxpayers' money in respect of rented accommodation this year and substantially more next year, it is important that such money be directed at the people who require it most.  We must also ensure that these individuals will be in a position to access good quality accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Unfortunately, many people are probably going to apply for rent supplement as a result of the rise in the number of house repossessions.  These individuals will probably begin by claiming mortgage interest supplement.  If their houses are repossessed, they will then seek rent supplement and will finally end up on the local authority housing lists.  A strong message should be sent to the financial institutions that foreclosing on people's mortgages is extremely short-sighted, particularly as this will give rise to untold difficulties for everyone involved and for society in general.  If these institutions delay taking precipitative action for a couple of years, it could be of assistance to the families to which I refer.  We try to be sympathetic to people who are in receipt of rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred to community welfare officers.  As she is aware, these individuals are employed by the Health Service Executive but they administer money on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This is another reason to proceed with the integration of community welfare officers into the Department.  We anticipate this will occur in the first half of next year and, as a result, we will have greater flexibility within our own staffing arrangements.  We have been given sanction to employ an additional 115 people in the Department in order to deal with the difficulties experienced by and increased pressure on our offices.  I will keep the matter under review when the new staff resources are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Various Members referred to issues relating to the registration of tenancies.  All landlords are required by law to register tenancies with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  However, they are only required to register when there is a tenant in place.  They are not required to register when they possess a building in which there are no tenants.  Landlords have a month within which they must register.  We do not want to penalise a tenant who may be moving into a property in which there may not have been any tenants in the past and in respect of which there would have been no legal requirement to register a tenancy.  We notify the PRTB when tenancies are created in order that it can follow matters up with the relevant landlords in order to ensure that the proper registration takes place.  We pass on to the PRTB the relevant information relating to all new claimants.  It is important that the board follow up on the information we provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The contract we have is with the tenant.  All the legal advice indicates that it is not with the landlord etc., even though many people request that their payment go directly to their landlords.  Questions arise with regard to the type of accommodation tenants seek to rent and Deputies will be aware that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has introduced new regulations designed to get rid of bed-sits in the next couple of years.  The latter is an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The extension of the rental accommodation scheme means that more people will qualify.  The scheme is operating well in all local authority areas throughout the country.  The availability of social and affordable housing within local authority areas will also be of assistance in the context of alleviating pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Deputy Finian McGrath was correct to refer to anti-social behaviour and the issues relating thereto.  There have been a number of public incidences of such behaviour in recent months.  There should be an obligation on tenants who are in receipt of State payments to ensure that they adhere to basic social norms.  It had been my intention to include in the Bill a provision to ensure that tenants in receipt of rent supplement would not engage in anti-social behaviour.  However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is working on the same issue in the context of the housing Bill and intends to draft guidelines on how to deal with such behaviour.  When those guidelines are put in place, we will be able to apply them in respect of those in receipt of rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">I do not propose to accept the amendment because we supply the information to which it relates in any event.  Our contract is with the tenant and the PRTB is obliged to follow up on matters relating to registration.  The scheme is under continual review.  We are aware of the pressures that will come into play.  We must honour our contracts with tenants and try to support them in the flexible manner required.  Our main aim is to ensure that these people do not remain too long on rent supplement.  The scheme was never intended to be of a long-term nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Deputy Enright referred to the number of hours people are allowed to work.  If one is in receipt of the supplement, one is not meant to be in full-time employment.  That is fine because the scheme is designed to support those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  However, when people on long-term rent supplement are deemed eligible for the rental accommodation scheme, they can engage in full-time employment.  That is an important distinction.  They can take up such employment and can then obtain entry to the local authority scheme, which provides them with better prospects, more hope, greater flexibility and, eventually, better housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The scheme must be kept under review.  In recent months the accommodation has been improving and the rents relating to it have been falling.  However, tenants must ensure that they do not pay over and above what they receive in the form of rent supplement because this only feeds the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">However, they will now have more choice in respect of the accommodation they wish to rent.  I accept that in small rural areas people's choices might be limited.  There is a great choice of accommodation in large urban areas because properties that did not sell are now being made available for rent.  We did not increase the limits this year because we did not want to feed the market.  Tenants should also seek not to feed the market, particularly as they have access to a greater choice in respect of higher quality accommodation.  Landlords must register with the PRTB, to which we forward the relevant information as soon as a new tenancy is created.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_501">I do not agree with the Minister with regard to better accommodation.  If a person is living in extremely poor accommodation and seeks to move to better accommodation, the first thing he or she must do is approach the community welfare officer in order to seek a deposit to secure that better accommodation.  Problems immediately arise in such circumstances because the individual's existing landlord will state that a window or tap was broken, that the grass was not cut according to the agreement reached, etc.  Tenants are often trapped as a result and cannot obtain a deposit to allow them to move house.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Minister missed the point that new landlords often seek deposits of far greater value than what is really required.  Community welfare officers will not provide people with deposits.  They maintain that tenants must be able to save enough money for their own deposits.  How can such people save €1,000, €1,500 or whatever for a deposit?  It is impossible for them to do so.  They are trapped and their existing landlords will demand payments from them and will not allow them to move on with their entire deposits intact.  They must then go to the community welfare officer to seek a transfer.  I have not yet seen, in respect of all the incidences brought to my attention — sadly, there have been many — a mechanism through which tenants can recoup their deposits when seeking to move to better accommodation.  I accept the Minister's remarks in respect of accommodation being available, but I do not believe the transfer by a person from poor to good accommodation is easy.  There is no mechanism in place to protect people in this instance.   Community welfare officers are not in a position to follow up these cases and there does not exist, as far as I am aware, any other person to do this work, thus leaving tenants trapped in their original tenancy.  These tenants are not in a position to move to better accommodation except, perhaps, under the RAS scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_503">I wish to make two brief points in regard to the mortgage interest supplement and rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I welcome that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is developing a policy in respect of anti-social behaviour.  However, I know of, as I am sure do my colleagues, many local authorities that currently have in place such policies.  The difficulty that arises — the Minister will discover this when dealing with local authorities in respect of rent supplement — is that a local authority, community welfare officer or any other person given responsibility for people on rent supplement, is powerless to act where one person in a family is causing trouble as they cannot penalise an entire family owing to the behaviour of one person.  I accept this difficulty is not the fault of Government, but it is a reality that makes it difficult to properly tackle anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">On quality of accommodation, I agree with Deputy Wall that there is no flexibility in terms of tenants moving accommodation.  On RAS, while I believe it is a good scheme a message must go out from local authorities that a person who signs up to the RAS scheme remains eligible for local authority housing.  There is a huge fear among people visiting clinics that this is not the case.  When an official inspects accommodation on behalf of the HSE, naturally the person in poor accommodation will fare better than the person living in good accommodation, as his or her need is seen to be greater.  A person trying to do the best for his or her family by signing up to the RAS scheme is fearful of being penalised and we must address this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_508">We must find a balance in terms of dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I wish to address the issue of transition from homelessness to accommodation under the rent supplement scheme.  Yesterday, I asked the Minister to request the Minister for Finance to negotiate with the banks to ensure people do not lose their homes by the putting in place of a stay on foreclosures during the period of operation of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  I believe that is a reasonable request and is the least taxpayers are entitled to from the credit institutions given they have put their necks on the line for banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Many homes for rent are advertised in the newspapers.  Often, when a constituent seeks guidance or assistance in renting accommodation and one rings seven or eight of the numbers listed in respect of accommodation to rent one is told they do not accept rent subsidy.  The reason some landlords are refusing to accept rent subsidy must ring an alarm bell somewhere.  I believe that almost certainly they are not tax compliant.  This matter warrants investigation and I hope such investigation will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The issue of deposits is of concern to all Deputies and local authority members.  I wonder if it would be possible to provide that, rather than pay a cash deposit, a local authority or community welfare officer would give a guarantee of standing in respect of a deposit in the event it is needed.  We all know that in 90% of cases deposits are unnecessary as the process of transition is usually quite reasonable.  The introduction of a guarantee scheme that does not involve the exchange of cash and so on might be the best option for all.  I hope the Minister will consider my proposition.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_512">I must begin by acknowledging that there are many excellent landlords in the country.  We have all visited homes which we believed were houses owned by the people living in them.  However, we also have many bad landlords.  They are the people who are giving good landlords a bad name, which is what we are speaking about today.  We must ensure that accommodation is of a high standard.  Many landlords are good people who will make allowances for various problems that arise in a house because they recognise they are the product of everyday life.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I believe the situation in respect of landlords refusing to accept rent supplement will change dramatically in the current circumstances.  When this happens, we must, as guardians of taxpayers' money, ensure that everyone is tax compliant and registered.  Deputy Wall has proposed a simple formula in this regard, namely, that part and parcel of an application for rent allowance is a section which must be filled out by landlords.  Landlords who are providing good accommodation and accepting rent supplement, will have no problem ticking a box which will indicate whether he or she is registered.  It is a simple form which will be returned by post to the relevant authorities, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">On anti-social behaviour, the Acting Chairman, Deputy Noel O'Flynn and I know, having been members of local authorities for many years, that the biggest problem facing local authorities is how to tackle families that are devastating estates.  Often, having gone through a lengthy legal process in this regard, these people are the following week ensconced in a private estate and virtually nothing can be done about it.  The only recourse is the community welfare officer who does not have the resources or manpower to do the job properly.  Something has to be done about this.  It is not good enough that a person whose son or daughter is wreaking havoc in an area can say they can do nothing about it; they can.  We must ensure this issue is addressed as such anti-social behaviour is not fair to the people living next door to or in the same community as these offenders.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_257" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_515">It is important to reiterate that the details of all new rent supplement tenancies are electronically forwarded to the Residential Tenancies Board to enable it to ensure landlords are meeting all their obligations.  Given the number of tenants in receipt of rent supplement — there are 50,000 new recipients this year — substantial work is being done in this area.  Of assistance in this regard is the new requirement in the budget that a person holding additional accommodation, be it a holiday home or rented house, pay €200 to a local authority.  Landlords will be caught under this provision also.  There are in place many mechanisms through which we can obtain this information.  It is important landlords are tax compliant and the provision of this information will ensure we can follow up those who are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Deputy Wall spoke of people who are unable to pay deposits.  The community welfare officer has discretion to give deposits.  So far this year, 10,500 payments at a cost of €6.2 million were made to people to enable them to put down a deposit on accommodation.  Perhaps what the Deputy outlined is just happening in a particular area.  We will keep this under review in the scheme over the next year or so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I accept what the Minister said and she has the figures for the deposits in front of her.  I am not arguing that point, but people have a major difficulty in obtaining deposits.  This problem has been raised in cases I have dealt with not only on the odd occasion but regularly and especially in the case of a transfer.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a major problem for people that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">We have talked about anti-social behaviour.  We all want what is right.  I honestly believe that if documentation is submitted, as proposed in the amendment, it would put people on guard in this respect.  Deputy Morgan is right in pointing out that people do not accept the social welfare commitment in this respect.  There is a question mark over landlords' tax in terms of rented accommodation.  The inclusion of the proposal in this amendment would put the person concerned on guard.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">If someone is registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, that is the end of the matter.  A fee is paid and there is no follow-up procedure.  Community welfare officers, due to their workload which is increasing, are not in a position to determine whether the leased property is good, bad or indifferent.  That does not happen.  Therefore, it is up to the tenant and, in many cases, the public representative to fight and argue with those in the private rental sector to try to improve the standards for those who have to seek rented accommodation.  If the proposed provision were included in the legislation, it would put down a marker.  The Minister said that she would keep this under review; I urge and expect her to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Rented properties should be subject to inspection to ensure they are of the standard any of us would consider suitable for occupancy by a tenant.  At present that does not happen.  We must put down a marker to landlords with properties in the rental accommodation sector to signal that we do not accept the standard of accommodation many of them offer and that this is a first step towards ensuring that they tick all the boxes; this will ensure there is an improvement in the standard of accommodation available.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">As the Minister rightly said about the banks and lending agencies, it is time for them to cop on in this regard.  The proposition put forward by Labour Party leader, Deputy Gilmore, of a two-year moratorium on mortgage repayments, if adopted, would, I hope, help many people get over the hurdle they face.  I know from contacts I have that the number of cases being taken in the High Court involving banks and lending agencies seeking repossessions is comparable to the number of leaves falling off the trees in autumn.  We must ensure the measure proposed is encompassed by the lending institutions as quickly as possible.  Perhaps the banks will see sense and accept that proposal from the Labour Party leader, having regard to what is also happening in England.  The inclusion of this amendment is necessary.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_653">In page 9, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_654">"14.—The Principal Act is amended in section 198 by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3D)—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_655">‘(3G) (i) The payment of a supplement towards the amount of rent payable by a person in respect of his or her residence shall be paid in its entirety by the Health Service Executive to the landlord.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_656">(ii) The tenant shall pay to the Health Service Executive the portion of the rent for which they are liable.'".</p>
          <p eId="para_657">In speaking on the previous amendment, I mentioned many of the reasons behind this amendment.  In circumstances in which a tenant accepts a tenancy that is agreeable to a community welfare officer but in which, unfortunately, a landlord expects more money, the tenant must pay the additional sum from his or her own resources.  This is a regular occurrence.  We want the HSE to make the payment to the landlord, thus alleviating any pressure on the tenant to provide more money.  Given that there is an increase in the tenancies in question, as we all agree, we must ensure there is transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Every Deputy who has spoken this morning stated there are many good landlords and that, unfortunately, there are bad ones also.  We are targeting the latter in this amendment.  We are asking that the HSE pay the money directly to the landlord, as is the case with the rental accommodation scheme.  There should be follow-on arrangements, bearing in mind that the accommodation a landlord may have might be acceptable under the rental accommodation scheme guidelines.  There should be contact right across the board in this area.  We should consider this and I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_659">Local authorities are currently required by law to ensure rented accommodation is of an adequate standard.  Only a handful of local authorities carry out inspections.  Last year, less than 5% of properties were inspected, which is a disgrace.  Some 30% of the 5% examined were found to be substandard, yet there were only 11 prosecutions by local authorities.  These statistics point to huge gaps between the floorboards.  Some kind of emergency investigation is required, be it by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There is something particularly out of kilter.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The same lackadaisical approach is taken in regard to tax compliance.  We know the Revenue Commissioners could deal with this more enthusiastically if minded to do so.  I acknowledge a political price would have to be paid by any Government that pursued this and addressed it once and for all.  It is like the plastic bag tax and the smoking ban; once they were put in place, people were considerably grateful to those courageous enough to have taken responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has failed to keep proper records regarding the €436 million paid out to landlords in rent subsidy.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners sought the information from the Department and was trying to connect it with information pertaining to the Private Residential Tenancies Board but I understand the office is now seeking a law or regulation that would permit it to do this.  There is obviously dragging of feet in terms of introducing whatever law or regulation is required to address the issue of wayward landlords, and that is most unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">It is estimated that there are some 50,000 unregistered flats and apartments.  I understand this is probably a conservative estimate.  If so, a radical overhaul is required urgently.  I would prefer to see the Government dealing with social housing by front-loading some of the national development plan projects, such as the building of social housing and schools, perhaps with money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  There would be a considerable return to the taxpayer because the State would no longer have to incur expenditure of €436 million, which figure is ever increasing.  I hope the Minister will treat this matter as seriously as it deserves to be treated.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">We need a mechanism to ensure landlords pay tax on whatever they receive through rent supplement.  I made this point in my contribution on amendment No. 13 and it is no harm to reiterate it.  I am not convinced this issue is being dealt with sufficiently.  We must ensure under-the-counter payments are not made.  They are being made at present.  Even Focus Ireland cited examples of where tenants are paying their landlords a little bit more than what is required.  Focus Ireland even cited instances of community welfare officers assisting tenants to pay more than what was required so the tenants would not end up homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">While this practice is occurring and must be dealt with, I do not believe this amendment is the way to proceed, for the simple reason that it is important that the tenant be able to manage his money and income himself.  The responsibility associated with receiving an allowance and paying it to a landlord develops good money-management habits.  It is important that the tenant have this sense of freedom and a sense of paying his way.  However, I understand what the amendment is trying to achieve and I ask the Minister to ensure landlords are not accepting extra payments from tenants.  The tenants simply cannot afford to be making them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_665">My views are somewhat similar to those of Deputy Enright.  As we all know, there has been a massive shift towards private rental accommodation in recent years.  This was obviously a policy decision taken by the Government and its predecessor as a consequence of their not providing sufficient social housing for those in need.  For this reason, I counsel against the proposal in question.  It is desirable that people feel responsible for their own accommodation.  The amendment is such that I fear debts would mount that would be owed to the Health Service Executive rather than the local authority.  This would leave people in a very awkward position, with the possibility of losing their accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Let us be honest about the fact that, in hard times, in which one might be at the pin of one's collar, the first one thing one would do if one felt one could get away with it would be to postpone paying one's rent.  This would be very bad in the longer term.  In the short term, one might feel one is getting away with something but the debt would continue to increase.  I understand what our Labour Party colleagues may be considering in proposing this amendment but there are other ways to address the problem of people abusing the system.  I would not address the problem at the expense of somebody who depends on receiving accommodation through the rental system.  Unfortunately, many such people are on low incomes and would find it very difficult to meet debts if they accumulated over a reasonably long period.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_667">I have similar views.  I fully appreciate the reason for the amendment in that there are issues that need to be addressed.  I would not worry about the likely impact of the amendment.  It could have a beneficial impact in that there could be a global negotiation of the rents being charged, with the Department having direct control.  Now may be the best time to achieve this.  Up to now, when there was a landlords' market, the practices described by Deputy Enright were rampant.  They still are and, in many cases, landlords are receiving an additional payment.  If they did not, they would not rent the accommodation.  One problem that arises is finding a sufficient number of landlords who are willing to accept checks by community welfare officers and, as a consequence, meet the accommodation needs of the individuals concerned.  As Deputy Seán Barrett said, this has arisen as a result of the failure by the Government to invest adequately in the capital housing programme.  This situation has continued for ten years and is appalling.  The Government resiled from the housing area and handed it over to well-meaning private housing agencies.  I will not mention particular agencies but they effectively cherrypicked from the housing market with the result that the local authority, with the few houses left at its disposal, must accommodate everybody else.  The result is turmoil.  We have an appalling housing situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">County Kildare has over 3,500 people on housing lists, all of whom, theoretically, would be entitled to rent supplement.  We cannot get sufficient people willing to rent houses and accept the welfare cheque for the rent.  That is a serious problem and nobody is tackling it.  It will get much worse because, coming into that marketplace and competing with those people, will be those who, because of the economic situation, are looking for mortgage and other supports.  On top of that, there are more and more emergency situations.  In the course of their daily work, Deputies receive emergency calls that require urgent attention.  It is no good for someone to tell us that it is all right, that the problem will be put through the system and perhaps in two months there will be a result.  That is of no benefit to an unfortunate person who awaits an urgent response.  These are issues that, in theory, are covered but, in fact, are not.  We have difficulties with individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The danger of making the payment directly to the landlord is that a peculiar situation might develop in the future.  I worry about that.  What happens at present is tedious and long drawn out.  There is, for example, the old practice of a person who moves from one rented accommodation to another where they had placed a refundable deposit — do Members remember the refundable deposit?  I differentiate here between the good and the bad landlord.  The bad one takes a look and tells the tenant he is sorry but he will not return the deposit because the paint was scraped off the door, or because something else is wrong.  I have no problem with a case where there has been damage to the house resulting in the tenant losing the deposit.  However, I do have problems with situations in which, on purely technical grounds, somebody decides a deposit is not refundable.  Following that, the public authority, the HSE or the Department of Social and Family Affairs, can leave that person on the roadside and do nothing for him or her, or can provide a new deposit.  The person does not have it and will not have the means to get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">There are many such areas that must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  They must be cleaned up in such a way as to provide for some kind of transparency and to ensure that the landlord does not have all the power.  We must try to ensure that the unfortunate person who urgently requires a rent supplement can have access to it at an affordable rate, from his or her point of view and from that of the State.  At the same time the person must be accountable to the State.  We know, and learn on an ever increasing basis, that the State does not appear to have endless resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">People appreciate the importance of the rent supplement and the importance of that relationship with the tenant.  Ultimately, that is what is involved.  It is an individual payment to an individual tenant, having regard to his or her circumstances.  It allows that tenant the flexibility to use the supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">However, where a tenant requests it, the rent supplement can be paid directly to the landlord.  Of the 70,000 people who are in receipt of rent supplement, 13,000 have requested that it go directly to the landlord.  Our contract with the tenant still remains but that flexibility is there.  I do not see any need to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">The thinking behind this amendment was to ensure that poverty traps for tenants do not develop and that they can be moved, as soon as possible, to the rental accommodation scheme.

          <p eId="para_679">I receive an amazing number of telephone calls relating that landlords are seeking to provide accommodation on the basis of the rental accommodation scheme.  Some of these involve individual houses.  Many are flats and apartments and I have even seen a retirement village for senior citizens secured by people under the rental accommodation scheme.  This provides a transparent way of ensuring that those in receipt of such payments are not put into poverty traps, that there would be a mechanism that can be checked and that there would be a linkage between the local authority, the landlord and the tenant.  That would be to the benefit of the tenant, which, ultimately, is the most important concern addressed by this amendment.</p>

The current eligibility thresholds, income disregards and different arrangements in place do not act as an disincentive to taking up employment.  It is important that even in cases where people qualify for rental accommodation scheme, they should continue to satisfy the criteria for rent supplement.  Once they get onto the rental accommodation scheme, they are then placed on differential rent assessment.  For the purposes of this particular scheme, which I shall continue to keep under review, I believe the eligibility criteria are sufficient.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_685">I spoke about this matter at length last night, with particular regard to mortgage interest supplement.  I will not reiterate the points I made but I believe strongly there must be changes.  All Deputies can cite examples of people who have been refused mortgage interest supplement because of the size of their mortgages.  If anything, the social welfare system must reflect the reality of the situations in which people find themselves.  This current payment does not do that.  I raised some of the issues concerning rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement.  The Minister's response referred to the responsibility of financial institutions, which we discussed last night also.  I do not disagree that financial institutions have a responsibility, but Deputies Kenny and Gilmore have publicly called for a moratorium on repossessions.  I have not heard the same call from the Government, however.  At least the Minister alluded to it today and I know she represents the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">It is extremely important for that message to come out loud and clear from the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  We will find ourselves in a position — we are already seeing it at our clinics daily — where people are in grave danger of losing their homes.  There is a responsibility on the financial institutions, but also on the Minister and the Department in this respect.  If people can get the mortgage interest supplement it may well allow them to keep their home.  They can then negotiate with the financial institutions on the basis that they have some extra income to help their repayments.  The qualifying criteria must be examined in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">In last night's debate, I made the point that if people do not get the mortgage interest supplement they will fall back on rent supplement and may eventually fall back on local authority housing.  The Minister reiterated that point today.  Some people, however, will not have the opportunity of relying on local authority housing because if they have opted to buy out such a house they must sign a form undertaking never to seek local authority housing again.  Some people, therefore, will find their homes being repossessed but will never be eligible for local authority housing because they have signed away their rights in that respect.  They will find themselves in serious danger either of becoming homeless or being left on rent supplement for the rest of their lives.  No Member of this House could agree with or stand over that situation.  Unless the mortgage interest supplement criteria are changed, and community welfare officers have more flexibility on the size of mortgages they can assist with, people will find themselves in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">In parts of the country in recent years, people bought out local authority houses at seriously expensive prices.  Ten years ago it was a different story and in many ways such purchases were a good deal, enabling people to move up the property ladder.  Many people bought local authority houses and sold them on to buy private houses.  They will also be debarred, however, because they were originally in local authority housing.  We must face that obstacle in the coming months and unless the criteria are changed, such people will have no alternative but to remain on rent supplement or emergency payments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I support the essence of what Deputy Wall is trying to achieve in this amendment.  I agree entirely with what he and previous speakers have said about it.  The thing that concerns me most, however, is that there has been complete silence from the Government about home owners who find themselves in this situation.  The Government has not said publicly that it will speak to the banks.  Under the terms of the credit institutions guarantee scheme, the Government clearly has every right to negotiate with the banks and, indeed, require them to adopt a certain position, at least for the two-year period of the guarantee scheme.  The Government should clarify where it stands on this matter because after Christmas many banks will foreclose on a significant number of mortgage holders.  The implication for the market is quite traumatic in terms of a significant collapse of housing prices.  It will have an even more traumatic effect for families with young children who find themselves in difficult circumstances when one or both partners may lose their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">A person cannot transfer from their own home to rented accommodation because local authority rules and regulations do not permit it.  One must first become homeless, so one stays in a bed and breakfast establishment or moves into grossly overcrowded accommodation with a relative perhaps, in some cases for several weeks before accommodation issues can be sorted out, including rent supplement and access to the housing list.  It can be a traumatic experience.  The Government should let people know what its intention is in this regard.  What is the Government's position on this?  Has it at least raised the matter with the credit institutions and, if not, does it intend to do so?  Does the Government accept that it has substantial powers under the terms of the credit institutions guarantee scheme?  How will it deal with the impending crisis that is coming down the line?  Nobody is asking for mortgages to be written off, or that people can get away without paying for arrangements they have made with their financial institutions.  In many cases, however, banks gave out 100% or 120% mortgages——</p>

          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_694">I fully agree with this important amendment and concur with previous speakers.  I do not know whether the Department of Social and Family Affairs fully appreciates the magnitude of the problem that is now unfolding before us.  Anything we have seen heretofore will fade into the dim and distant past in comparison to this.  A series of problems are turning up.  For instance, we now have a cohort of people who are self-sufficient, self-starters and always looked after their own businesses.  They did the right thing and were not a burden on the State.  They bought their house in good faith and were loaned money in an economy with rapidly escalating prices.  There is no doubt that they borrowed unwisely, but they were forced to do so because otherwise they would have been left without a house, renting instead from a landlord or investor.  In that case, the rent would be equal to their mortgage repayments, so they were in a catch-22 situation.  I can tell the Minister it is a case of "Mé féin ar an lámh eile" again.  In many cases, given the unfolding economic situation, those people now find themselves out of a job.  The criteria being applied to assess their cases are old-fashioned.  Those criteria may have been applicable four or five years ago when people were quite happy because they had economic alternatives, but there are problems now.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I compliment community welfare officers who are adopting a human attitude to such assessments.  There is a minority who do something totally different.  Messages are sent down the chain that this is the answer and that going to a TD will not help.  If there is one thing that revs up my engine, it is that phrase.  We should send a clear message to whoever issued the diktat saying "Don't go to your local TD because they can't help you either".  We are elected as public representatives and have a job to represent people, including those who are disadvantaged for whatever reason.  In addition, we are not beholden to any officials or others, and do not have to account to them.  I issue that fair warning as to how such people will be treated in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">Absolutely and I will continue to try to keep it that way as well.  Although it is being dealt with separately, the question of qualification under the habitual residency clause has been abysmally abused.  The Minister knows about this and it was referred to yesterday.  It is appalling.  Irish citizens who were born in this country and emigrated — like the 42 million of Irish extraction in the United States and a very substantial number who emigrated to the UK — are being refused supplementary rent support at this moment, simply because of the habitual residency clause.  It is absolutely disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">That clause was not introduced for the best of reasons.  I know full well whom it was intended to deal with.  Like other Irish solutions to Irish problems it is now hammering the people who are most vulnerable in our society and who can do nothing to respond, finding themselves between a rock and a hard place.  I am not the only Member of this House meeting such people on a daily basis.  Imagine the plight of returned emigrants from the UK, the US or anywhere in the world — they are entitled to come back to their own country.  What type of a country have we become?  They are now being refused rent support and other supports while the community welfare officers, in effect, gently intone, "Would you consider leaving this country?".  How nice of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Perhaps I am too long in this House, but never in my time as an elected representative have I seen the application of that type of criteria.  It is appalling that we, as a so-called caring society, should treat people like that.  If there are people in this country who should not be here, why does somebody on the Government side of the House not say so?  What are they hiding behind?  Let them say it up-front and we can all have a look at this.  Let there be no hidden agendas, no Irish solutions to Irish problems.  Let us be fair and straight with everybody.  Remember, we have obligations under international law and human rights commitments as well, which must be adhered to.  No clever, slick anticipation or interpretation of rules and regulations and no clever responses at any level should, or will, be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I want to mention the lending agencies and repossessions.  For example, I referred to a case yesterday in this same debate, the logic of which I cannot understand.  A person is on a mortgage, say, of €2,000 a month, when circumstances change.  It is not a small mortgage, but there are many people on such mortgages who bought property in what they saw as good times.  The Government assured them their future was secure and that this was the third richest country in the world, with 10% annual growth and with even greater growth prospects on the horizon.  Everything was full of promise coming up to the general election, but what has happened now?</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Family disputes can arise in a case like this, in many instances caused by the financial burden and one or other partner may leave the household, in the event.  The current interpretation of the law will mean the community welfare officer will tell the remaining partner, usually the woman, in effect, "Sorry, you only get half the potential rent or mortgage support", as against what the household would receive when both partners were there.  I cannot understand the logic of that.  All that will happen is that she will fall further behind and be evicted.  Then the Department will have to give her rent support for the entire amount in another house.  Why does somebody not talk to the community welfare officers and explain to them what the consequences are?  Incidentally, I received a coded message within the last few days after putting down a parliamentary question on one of these issues.  A coded message came by way of the response sent out to the unfortunate constituent, which would appear to me to be a response to my parliamentary question.  I recognise coded messages for what they are, and the response will be as it always was.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">My last point echoes Deputy Olwyn Enright's concerns about the agreements people are being forced to sign, usually when they are under pressure, to the effect that they can never seek local authority rehousing again.  Of course that is illegal.  There is no law anywhere that can uphold that.  It is pure extortion, an abuse of power by the authorities.  They have no right to make such a demand, ever.  No one can possibly determine what his or her circumstances will be like in the future, as we now know.  Even the Government, which knew everything a couple of years ago, one year or six months ago, now knows nothing about anything.  It can tell us nothing.  The whole economy is falling apart, but it cannot tell us how it happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Equally, no court can enforce this agreement referred to by Deputy Enright, which countless people have felt obliged to sign, because the circumstances have changed.  Once circumstances change, it is the duty of whatever Administration is in office to adjudicate on the basis of the prevailing situation.  If there were more people present on the Government side today, I should love to engage with them on that particular issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">I assume the Minister will accept this amendment because all it is seeking is, that on the passing of this Bill a report should be prepared and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That seems to me to be a very sensible way of approaching this particular problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I should respectfully suggest that, having been laid before both Houses, it should then be debated by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs so that the views of all committee members can be sought on how we deal with this unique problem.  It is unique because of the state of the economy, banking and building society structures.  This is something I have never seen before, and I have lived through a couple of recessions.  It is unique in so far as the banks and building societies are in such a mess that strange things could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I tend to ask when there is a problem how it may be solved, and what will happen if such and such an initiative is taken.  Let us consider for a moment what will happen if people are thrown out of their houses.  What will be done with the people?  They have to go somewhere and they are entitled, under the supplementary welfare Act to seek assistance, albeit for accommodation.  What is to be done with the house that has been taken from them?  Is to be added to the other tens of thousands of vacant dwellings?</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Perhaps the Minister might listen to a point I am trying to make here.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">What are we to do with the tens of thousands of houses already vacant?  This is something that has to be debated openly and positively within these Houses.  Nobody is addressing the situation at all.  What happens to the building industry?  Are another 10,000 or 20,000 vacant houses to be added to an already very serious situation?  This is not just about taking the house of a particular couple and putting them on the street.  What happens after that?  This is part of what must be dealt with in the resolution of the banking problem.  What is the difference between toxic debt from land banks and toxic debt from vacant houses?  In other words when this issue is being debated by the Government, I respectfully suggest that it take this situation into account.  If the Government is to resolve the difficulties with the banks, it will have to solve the problem of toxic land banks which are the main cause of the crisis.  Nobody will invest in banks without knowing the level of debt that exists in respect of land banks.  There is no market for such land, and therefore no one knows its value.  It could have been worth €100 million two years ago but nobody knows its value today because there is no market.  It could be worth €50 million or €20 million or €70 million.  However, all adding to the vacant housing stock will do is drive the market crazy altogether.  If one applies the normal principle of failure to repay in the current climate, we will have a huge problem, incapable of being resolved other than by removing people from their houses, sending them to the community welfare officer and giving them a supplementary welfare allowance until such time as they can rent accommodation.  Then they go back to the Department of Social and Family Affairs and get rent subsidy.  It is all a roundabout.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">This issue must be resolved quickly, because it will not go away.  Unique situations demand unique solutions.  This problem has not been solved previously, because we did not have this situation.  Therefore, the thinking caps must go on in all Departments.  The Department of Finance must wear its thinking cap in negotiations with banks and building societies.  The Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children must wear theirs in dealing with the HSE because of its involvement with community welfare officers.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must wear its cap when considering public housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I cannot stress enough the importance of this amendment, even though it does not seek something immediate, but asks that something happen as soon as the Bill is passed.  The amendment should be accepted by all here.  It is not a party political issue, but a real problem for which people are awaiting a resolution.  Everybody has an interest in finding a solution to this problem, whether one is a person with growing debts for either rent or mortgage repayments, a property owner who is renting property or a building society or bank that has loaned money.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I have always found it peculiar that one of the conditions in respect of rent allowance was that a couple did not qualify if one was on welfare, but the other was working more than 30 hours.  There is no reference to the amount one is earning if one is working over 30 hours.  A person could be earning more money on 25 hours.  It is all about ticking the box.  People could be earning €12 an hour and working 25 hours or €8 an hour and working 30 hours, but they would be better off if they were working 25 hours at €12 an hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I have never been able to understand the ceiling of 30 hours.  Perhaps the ceiling should be an amount earned rather than the number of hours worked.  If somebody was working 31 hours, he would most likely go to his employer and ask him to take two hours off him so as not to lose his rent allowance.  This issue needs debate.  The acceptance of this amendment would give a guarantee to the House that a report will be produced on the implications of any changes.  A committee is the right place for such a report to be debated and it could then come back to the House with its report.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_713">I will be as brief as possible.  Like most other Deputies, I have some experience of the difficulties faced by people in this regard.  I wish to mention a particular case that has come to a conclusion.  In this case a couple went to Start Mortgages when they were under pressure to meet payments other than their loan repayments.  They were encouraged by advertisements to put all their borrowings into one loan.  Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, the man lost his job.  As soon as the first payment became overdue, it became a legal issue.  When the couple eventually got a loan elsewhere, one they thought they were fortunate in getting at the time, they discovered on Christmas Eve, six months later, there was an outstanding bill of €12,000 for the legal case that had been entered, although nothing had arisen from it.  Eventually, this was settled for €10,000 and the couple had their loan facilitated by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">There are implications with regard to such cases.  The requirement that people sign an agreement that they will never be housed by a local authority again is unjust and perhaps close to illegal.  In the current situation, where so many people are losing jobs and where many may have stupidly over-borrowed, we should face the facts.  Everybody was being encouraged to buy their own home.  They were sitting in queues outside offices to ensure they would get these homes and loans were being offered by several banks, not just one.  Now these people have lost jobs and found themselves in extraordinary situations, we should be considerate of their situations and be sympathetic.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I understand our counterparts across the water have made allowances on account of the current situation in recent announcements and I urge the Minister, in conjunction with the Taoiseach and the Government, to do something similar.  We have a crisis and it must be dealt with.  I support my colleagues Deputies Enright and Barrett on the issues they have raised.  There are technical issues in the system that have no logic.  Just because somebody works over 30 hours in a low-paid job, does not mean he or she is making a fortune or is self-sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Another case I am aware of is that of a person who was self-employed until recently, but now has no work.  However, his mortgage is ongoing.  There is significant difficulty in obtaining social welfare assistance for this person because he does not have the stamps required.  We are in a unique position.  Nobody is happy with the situation or proud of it.  I do not wish to cast aspersions across the House about the position we are in, but young couples are in extraordinary situations and have mortgages they cannot meet.  I urge the Minister, as a goodwill gesture, to accept the amendment in order to alleviate some of the problems.  Accepting the amendment will not cost any money.  It will only facilitate the drawing up of a more logical process and give us the opportunity to debate the issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_283" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I share people's concerns about the number of people who must fall back on mortgage interest supplements and those people who are in danger of losing their homes.  We discussed some of the issues surrounding this last night and earlier today.  The problem is evident in the number of people making new applications.  We had 7,000 at the end of October and I suspect that number will be substantially higher by the end of November.  Unfortunately, we can anticipate great demand again next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Deputy Barrett is right about the surplus of houses.  What good will the surplus be to the banks even if they reclaim the houses?  In the current market, they will probably end up selling them for less than the mortgage handed out initially.  The situation has a serious impact on the families involved and on the community.  The amount of money we anticipated spending on this area this year has fallen far short of what is required.  We reckon now that the amount required to be spent will be €26 million and the provision for next year is €31 million.  However, looking at the outturn for this year, I expect more will be required next year as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The scheme is one that has always been used by a small number of people.  However, as demand increases, we will have to examine the needs of the applicants.  It is a means-tested scheme and those who qualify get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">In some ways this counteracts the argument regarding working for 30 hours because one is still obliged to remain within a particular limit.  However, it is designed not to be a disincentive to people to enter full-time employment and by limiting this to one group, one always tries to encourage people to take up employment.  However, I accept these are changing and difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">It should be noted that the social welfare budget is not limitless.  A total of €19.6 billion has been set aside for next year, which constitutes an extraordinary amount of taxpayers' money as a proportion of next year's overall expenditure.  Consequently, one must ensure that it is targeted at the right people and those who need it most.  I intend to carry out a review of the mortgage interest supplement and the criteria surrounding it soon.  However, I am unsure what information can be derived in respect of applicants, those who do not qualify etc., because the scheme operates through the community welfare officers.  Nevertheless, I will ascertain what information can be gleaned.  As the scheme operates by regulation, it would not require further legislation, were the Government to introduce any changes.  While I do not propose to accept the amendment on the report, I acknowledge such an amendment is designed to allow debate on a particular issue, which is the reason it was tabled.  However, as Members have suggested, this might be a matter the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs may decide it could usefully examine.  I will be consider it over the next couple of months in any event.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_722">I believe the sincerity expressed regarding the amendment by Members is a reflection both of its wording and case history with which they have had personal dealings.  Great research undoubtedly is needed on the qualifying criteria for the mortgage interest supplement payment by the applicant.  The Minister correctly observed that few applications had been received heretofore, as the number of applications only has increased within the past year to 18 months.  Previously, it had been a matter of showing one's account and demonstrating that interest was accumulating, after which a community welfare officer would make the payment.  However, a change has taken place in this regard.  Community welfare officers now insist the original loan agreement must be produced and if they discern anything wrong or perceive any additions in respect of seeking the mortgage, they will refuse payment.  This is happening at present, presumably nationwide, and the need to examine this issue has never been more overwhelming because, unfortunately, as the Minister noted, the numbers are increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">A different emphasis has been placed on processing such applications than was the case heretofore.  On numerous occasions, I have been obliged to write to lending agencies asking them to produce the original documentation in order that the person affected could make an application, which would not be accepted otherwise.  This amendment was tabled with such cases in mind and because the matter was discussed by the Parliamentary Labour Party and elsewhere.  Members' concerns arise from personal contact with such situations and they considered it necessary to table this amendment, which I intend to press.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_724">I wish to express my disappointment.  Members have gone through the process of debating the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which is on Report Stage today.  However, the Minister has not accepted any measures that have been tabled.  It sounds as though she agrees in theory with much of what has been said.  The amendment contains nothing that is offensive to, or critical of, the Government.  It contains nothing that would imply a loss of political capital by the Minister, were she to accept it.  This amendment reflects the extremely difficult position that many people face at present.  While the Minister has stated her intention to produce a report, this amendment exerts pressure to ensure such a report is actually produced.  With respect, although Members have been waiting for a report on lone parents from the Minister, her predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and his predecessor, the late Séamus Brennan, Lord have mercy on him, no action has been taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">People are in danger of having their houses repossessed, some of whom are unaware they are in such danger.  They may be in the position outlined by Deputy Noonan yesterday regarding a family he knows, in which two children and both of their spouses work in a company he believes to be in serious danger of closure.  This will mean a further two couples whose houses will be repossessed next year.  This urgent matter cannot wait and must be dealt with and the Minister should take on board Members' comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I will briefly reiterate a point I made yesterday.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this subject following Committee Stage and it transpires the Department and the community welfare officers do not even hold data on the number of people who applied for, but were refused, mortgage interest supplement.  The Minister's report must start with the most basic information in respect of who is unable to get the supplement.  The only time statistics are collated is when applicants appeal a refusal.  While I am sure a majority do so, it is possible that not all applicants appeal because of their disillusionment with their interaction with the system, having been refused in the first place.  A report on this issue must begin with the basics and accepting this amendment at least would confirm that the Government in good faith intends to deal with this issue, because this is not evident at present.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_727">I appeal to the Minister to reconsider her decision.  In any parliamentary democracy, if someone comes up with a perfectly reasonable request to the effect that a report be produced that could provide information for further debate, it always is good for a government to have the input of positive contributions from its opposition.  I do not understand how a government can refuse to accept an amendment calling for the production of a basic report.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Minister's reply also referred to the fact that the taxpayer only can pay so much.  All Members agree with that point and they acknowledge the budget for social welfare is large.  However, everyone pays PRSI to be used at a time of need and this issue goes beyond that.  Moreover, in respect of much of what has been discussed in this regard, I do not seek the taxpayer to fork out.  This issue must be resolved by those banks and building societies that gave out such loans in the first place.  My point is that as part of the current negotiations with banks and building societies about recapitalisation and saving their businesses, the Government should play an active part by throwing this issue into the melting pot for debate.  The financial institutions should then come up with a solution that Members may not be able to formulate in the space of half an hour's debate in the House.  The taxpayer should not be obliged to pay everything and the building societies and banks must find a system, although I am unsure how, to deal with how repayments will be made or how different payments could be made at different times to catch up and similar matters.  Ultimately, when it comes to paying off the loan, hopefully the house in question will have risen in value again and will be worth more than what actually was owed.  It would be better to have people remaining in their homes and seeing it out to the end, rather than being kicked out on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Members should put on their thinking caps and should not engage in party politics.  If the Minister refuses to accept the amendment, the division bells will ring and Members will be taken from their lunch tables who will not know on what amendment they are voting.  I suggest that were one to conduct a survey of every Member of the House asking them whether they agree with voting for the production of a report following the passage of a Bill, they all would do so.  However, if the Minister sticks to her guns and refuses to accept this amendment, the division bells will ring, Members will march in, the Minister will win and that will be the end of it.  This is an appalling way in which to run a parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">Last year 4,111 people benefited from the scheme.  This year 7,000 have benefited already, and probably many more will have benefited by the end of this month.

          <p eId="para_736">The amendment merely seeks a report and it is not appropriate to provide for that in legislation.

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_738">I listened to all the contributions and I did not speak earlier because I would agree with everything that has been said.  There is nothing surer than that research must be done on this area.  As soon as the Minister leaves this House, given the figures that will be generated in the next few months on the mortgage assistance which her Department must give, there is nothing surer than that she will need to commission a report.  That report will be about the level of activity in the service, how it is delivered, how much help people need, why they need that help, what is the proposed length of time for which they will need that help and the different types of mortgages that will be in play.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The Minister makes the argument that it is not right to ask for a report within the social welfare Bill, and I accept that.  I am sure that it would be sufficient if everyone could agree that a report will be done, but it must be done urgently.  It is not merely about the gathering of statistics because one could bring any community welfare officer in here and he or she would tell the Minister the facts and figures on what they have encountered over the past few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It is not good enough that at a time when ever more people are falling back and relying on the State, to which they contributed handsomely over the past number of years through tax and social insurance contributions, this restriction comes in.  The Minister cannot do that.  People must feel that when they need help the State will be there to pick up the pieces for them.  That is the purpose of the social insurance fund.  The type of research and report needed must be done as a matter of urgency because we are not certain exactly what type of help will be required; it will be different across individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">There is one issue which has not been raised, and I am reluctant to raise it.  In the past number of years some break-ups resulted in  the family home being sold and the profit divided between the two parties involved, irrespective of whether they were married.  Neither party has had enough money to buy a home of his or her own and yet is precluded from going back on the State's housing list because he or she has funds under the means-tested element of the scheme.  That is something that needs to be included in the reporting system.  Where does that leave people?  It is the most peculiar system I have ever come across.  The system does not encourage thrift or savings.  No matter how little one has in the bank, one cannot benefit from State aid because it will be means-tested against one's claim.  That is something that needs to be put into the report as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">That report could and should be done in a matter of weeks.  The Minister would be foolish to say "No".  She and I know that in a matter of weeks she will be looking for this anyway.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">This amendment was brought on foot of submissions and our own experience of the mortgage interest supplement.  I am sure every Deputy received submissions from FLAC and other housing organisations.  One of the points made by FLAC is that the changes in the Bill will further restrict access to the mortgage interest supplement by reducing the duration of the payment and excluding specific mortgages from support by inserting new definitions of mortgage interest.  Increased administrative powers will be delegated to the HSE.  Unless a new mechanism is set up to deal with it, the present arrangement will result in the community welfare officers being overcome with work.  In that situation I do not see how any further workload can be added.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">As I stated on the previous amendment, the existing legislation is sufficient with regard to the qualification aspect of a person for mortgage interest relief.  If the timing is to be decreased or some specific mortgages are to be excluded, we would defeat the purpose of payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I am sure that is not the intention.  The Minister has outlined the projected figures for November, December and January and these indicate mortgage interest relief is on the increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">If it is the case we will now see restrictions put in place in the present application, it seems we will increase the pressure on the unfortunate person who must look for this payment.  Our worst days as public representatives are probably when we see someone who cannot pay his or her mortgage or get agreement with the lending agency.  These people may have gone to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which is a great organisation that has done tremendous work in helping so many in this position, but they may not reach an agreement there either.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">If we are to increase the pressure on these people by decreasing the ability of a person to make an application, we are surely creating a case that will cause major concern to the family unit.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch has mentioned cases where some people are trying to buy out a portion of a mortgage from a partner or former partner where there has been a breakdown.  In this instance, if both parties are suddenly unemployed and restrictions have been increased in the application for mortgage supplement, havoc will be created.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I do not see a need for this.  I have seen instances where the community welfare officer insists that the original loan application be the base of negotiations but this will create difficulty in the current economic climate, unless the Government provides a measure for mortgage protection in the next year or two.  Families may be now subjected to further tension and problems in the making of an application in this regard.  That is why our spokesperson, Deputy Róisín Shortall, felt the whole section should be deleted, as the current position is good enough.  The mechanism is available and the process has been put through scrutiny in the last number of months because of increased numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I do not see the need to make changes as the mechanism exists and community welfare officers, to my knowledge, use it to maximum effect with regard to qualification for mortgage interest relief.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment and leaving the matter as it is.  In fairness to the Minister, she has indicated she is willing to consider the issue going forward in order to ensure all the problems will be considered.  There are many problems, including family and partnership break-ups and people trying to buy out portions of mortgages.  These problems are all related to the family being under sustained pressure while trying to own its home.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The one light at the end of the tunnel is that we have seen recent decreases in interest rates, which has been a major help for some people trying to address this problem.  I can see no logic in changing the framework to make it more difficult to obtain a mortgage or rent subsidy payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">I do not propose to accept the amendment.  We are trying to give legislative provision for regulations and strengthen the legal basis for those regulations.  The section provides for amendments to the legislative provisions and we feel they are necessary for both the rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement.  Regulations already set out the maximum rent levels that apply to rent supplement, having regard to the family size, the location of the premises and the period to which the limits apply.  The primary legislation is being amended to provide for the making of regulations to specify the maximum amount of rent supplement payable having regard to family circumstances and the location of the residence in respect of which the rent supplement is payable.  It is a technical amendment to strengthen the legal base for the relevant regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The section also contains provisions to make regulations setting out the conditions and circumstances under which the mortgage interest supplement can be paid and the duration of the payment.  It shall be limited to the amount the HSE determines appropriate but the HSE must have regard to the family circumstances of the person concerned, as well as the other conditions as prescribed in the regulations governing mortgage interest supplement.  This is not to disadvantage people but to give a legal basis for the regulations which have been made.</p>

          <p eId="para_896">I have put down this amendment because of the financial difficulties being faced by families, particularly when children are returning to school.  More people have been brought in under the scheme this year but according to surveys done by various organisations, it is still inadequate in meeting the needs of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Research carried out by Barnardos indicates that between €375 and €405 is required to fund basic costs of sending children back to school and there is a substantial shortfall for many families.  This has not been helped by the decision on the school book scheme by the Department of Education and Science, which will put much pressure on families that are already hard-pressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Figures published by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in June, when it concentrated on back to school issues, and earlier this week show substantial increases in the number of people using the organisation, which is of real concern for everybody in the House.

          <p eId="para_899">Were the back to school clothing and footwear scheme seriously examined, many savings could be made in its administration.  I do not understand why someone must re-apply each year.  People must fill in detailed forms before having them stamped by their schools.  I understand the need to ensure the allowance's claimant has a child going to school, but the administration could be well done through the school.  The school need not ask whether the person requires the allowance, only whether the child is still attending.  The duplication in forms has never made sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The amount available to be drawn down by a family has never made sense either.  In the past ten years, children have become twice as big as we were when we went to school.  The footwear they need cannot be covered by the money given by the Department.  Not only must we take all of these factors into account, but we must also consider to whom we are giving the money, why we are giving it and, despite how obvious the scheme's name is, to what use it is put.  How can one best ensure that families qualifying for the allowance get sufficient money to clothe their children when returning to school?  I know of no family that can cover the costs of uniforms and other necessities.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Fashion changes and young people are notorious in not wanting to wear what their parents buy for them, but the number of children who do not wear jackets, for instance, when exiting their schools, particularly secondary schools, is extraordinary.  Why is this the case?  The Green Party would say it is due to global warming and that we no longer need clothes, but that is not the reason.  Rather, jackets are too expensive and cannot be covered by the money the Department gives families.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">During the 1980s, the progression evident outside the labour exchange was amazing.  During the first six months of a person's unemployment, he or she was well dressed, well kept and still in the mode of looking for work.  Gradually, his or her appearance started to go downhill.  Three years after first being made unemployed, he or she still had the same jacket, although it was not in the same condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The same trends are evident in terms of school uniforms and the kinds of clothing that we need.  Constantly, a friend makes the point that we do not dress for the type of weather in which we live whereas all other Europeans do.  However, they have a higher standard of living than we do.  Even during our boom times, our treatment of those families and school-going children that needed our support was poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">More people will seek the back to school scheme.  Regarding the notion that, come August, there will be a radio campaign to advertise for applications, why will the scheme not be rolled out in June when schools will be about to finish and why will those who were on the scheme in the preceding year not be written to in an effort to determine whether their children are still in school and dependants?  The duplication in the scheme is worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Community welfare officers and workers in the Department of Social and Family Affairs have been referred to throughout the debate.  They operate under the rules that we lay down.  We must reconsider the scheme and expand it significantly.  The clothing and footwear costs of putting a child through school have increased sizably because their needs have increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_906">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is an important scheme.  This year alone, 103,000 households and 200,000 children have benefited from it.  As I have extended the thresholds, a further 18,000 families will qualify next year in addition to those who would have qualified under the current thresholds.  I chose to extend the thresholds to make it more widely available rather than to increase the amount involved.  Since it is the clothing and footwear allowance and not the book allowance, a fact that should be recognised, the amount of €305 is not bad and would cover uniforms and clothes.  In the past 12 months and in recent years, the prices of clothing and footwear have decreased by 7% and 24%, respectively.  However, there can be pressure where young people want labels, fashion and so on.  It is all the more reason for school uniforms, which do not demand expensive shops.  A simple top of navy, grey or so on with a crest ironed or stitched on can be just as distinguishing a factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">Books are expensive, but Deputy Kathleen Lynch's suggestion that the clothing and footwear allowance should be paid through the school is interesting.  When I was Minister for Education and Science, people did not want the book allowance to be paid through the school because they did not want to be identified in the school.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">A promotional campaign undertaken last June while children were still in school suggested that people should purchase early.  There is always a danger whereby people who get money and, instead of spending it on a uniform, use it for a holiday during the summer months may find themselves being stuck in August or September.  The scheme is available from June to the end of September, but we promoted it in June and August.  I will examine the take-up levels in those months.  Many people only start to focus closer to the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I anticipate that many more people will apply for the scheme next year, when our spending on it will have increased to €39 million.  The 18 year olds in respect of whom child benefit payments will no longer be made will instead receive €520 in compensation if they are in education.  This will push costs up, but I welcome the fact that more people will be able to benefit from the scheme during a particularly difficult time for families next year.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_311">

          <p eId="para_916">I do not know whether many of the people who have approached me concerning sending their children back to school have been on holidays.  It is unfair to claim that people will spend the money on holidays or so on.  They receive the allowance because their incomes are low and they could not otherwise afford sending their children back to school.  Their incomes are so low that, for many, holidays are something about which they have heard but of which they have not had the pleasure of experiencing.  People will not collect the allowance to go on holidays.  The Minister's unfair comment immediately creates the notion that people on such allowances are scamming the system or do not need them, but they need them to send their children back to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Much of what I will say will relate to child poverty levels, which I will also discuss during the debate on the next amendment.  As is evident from Deputy Kathleen Lynch's examples, the provisions in the Bill will not help people sufficiently.  The Minister must consider the scheme's operation.  If savings can be made through operating it more efficiently, people can avail of it, which we would all like to be the case.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_312" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_918">There are some social welfare payments in respect of which it would be possible to pay the allowance automatically.  However, there are other circumstances where people might be in employment or on contributory payments where we would be obliged to consider the household income, etc.  We must be in a position to know a family's situation on the occasion of its making an application.  It is not quite as easy as it appears.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I accept that this is an extremely valuable payment for people who are obliged to pay for clothing and footwear.  For example, if one has two children, the payment is €610.  This sum is perhaps larger than any other which a person may previously have held in his or her hands.  It is important that we focus on what is required.  However, we will certainly promote the scheme from an earlier date next year in order to discover what will be the take-up in respect of it.  As already stated, we anticipate that demand will increase over the next 12 months.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_922">"(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on the introduction of a second-tier, employment neutral, child income support payment to target child poverty levels.".</p>
          <p eId="para_923">I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and I am reintroducing it now because I am concerned about the lack of progress regarding the supplements paid to families, particularly in respect of children.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to amalgamate the qualified child allowance and family income supplement in order to develop a second tier of income supports targeted at the poorest families.  There has not been any progress in respect of this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">NESC compiled a very good report on this issue and discovered that the outcomes for children, in terms of efforts to tackle child poverty, were unsatisfactory and that child benefit is extremely inefficient in the context of tackling poverty.  NESC recommended the establishment of a new second tier support for families on low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The Minister placed on record some figures in respect of the EU-SILC report, which was published yesterday.  The CSO also published a report yesterday which contains some interesting statistics and which indicates that 20% of children living in Ireland last year were living in poverty.  It also states that the children most at risk are those who are underprivileged and that almost 40% of the total number of people living in consistent poverty are children.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">There is a real need for the payment to which I refer because it will be targeted at those who need it most.  I intend to press the amendment because I want progress to be made in respect of this matter.  It is important that a report be laid before the Houses and that we obtain clarification on where the Government stands and in respect of its views on progress being made.  Unless amendments of this sort are taken seriously, matters will be placed on the long finger.  I do not want to have to table this amendment again next year in respect of the relevant legislation because progress has not been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The lives of children who live in poverty are substantially different from those of their peers.  There are children attending school today who have not eaten a hot meal, who have no heat in their home or who do not own a coat.  One of the criteria used to judge whether a child is living in poverty is whether he or she only possesses one pair of shoes.  Many of us may find it difficult to imagine trying to live in such conditions.  However, almost 20% of children in this country are obliged to live in consistent poverty.  Targeting the payment represents the only way that real improvements will be made.  The changes in the qualified child allowance and family income supplement were not sufficient in the context of improving the lives of the children to whom I refer.</p>

          <p eId="para_928">I strongly support the amendment.  Children are among those who are most at risk in society.  The relevant agencies have indicated that the level of child poverty in this State is significant.  The evidence in this regard cannot be disputed.  I accept that it is not easy to deal with this matter because of the complexities and difficulties involved.  However, a resolution must be found and Deputy Enright's amendment offers some guidance to the Minister in that regard.  I hope she will give serious consideration to accepting it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_929">I support the amendment.  We all pay lip-service to children and families.  However, regardless of the family or other circumstances in which they live, children expect to have a certain lifestyle.  Peer pressure is an extremely important factor in children's lives.  When we refer to such pressure, it usually brings to mind teenagers.  However, peer pressure starts at a very young age.  When they are first affected by it, some children probably do not know what the term "peer pressure" means or what it implies.  As everyone is aware, Christmas is almost upon us.  Let us consider the case of two four year olds in a crèche or preschool facility, one of whom has asked for a particular doll — and her buggy and various accessories — that has been advertised on television.  What will be the position if she receives this present, while her counterpart, who also wants it, does not and receives a lesser present instead?  There is nothing to indicate that children are not affected when they do not receive that for which they have been hoping.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">I thought I might be sued if I made my next comment, but that cannot happen because I am speaking under Dáil privilege.  Perhaps it was because it reminded me of my childhood, but I did not like <i> Angela’s Ashes</i>.  However, one aspect of the book struck me as profound, namely, the fact that children feel humiliation.  It is not just adults or teenagers who are affected in this regard.  When their parents are not financially secure enough to provide them with a comfortable home and the same supports to which certain of their peers have access, children feel humiliated, not just on their own behalf but also on behalf of their parents.  That feeling of humiliation never leaves them.  We should strive to eliminate feelings of inadequacy among particular children with regard to the financial position of their families.  Certain youngsters feel that they are somehow lesser beings because Santa Claus did not give to them the toys other children received.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Child poverty is very obvious when one looks closely enough.  A child living in poverty is one who does not have a coat, who attends the funeral of a grandparent but who is not dressed in a suit and tie, who cannot go on a school trip or who does not receive a bicycle when everyone else living on the road gets one.  As adults, we have all passed the stage of feeling peer pressure and we now know what is truly important, namely, the support, encouragement and love one obtains from one's family.  When we were children, however, we were of the view that material possessions, etc., were all important.  We want to get rid of child poverty in order that every youngster can feel free to harbour the same ambitions as their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">It is not as if we came to a realisation about this matter following a sudden flash of blinding light.  Those who carried out research into child poverty and indicated the remedies that might be used in respect of it were obliged to highlight the problem for us.  We should strive to get rid of child poverty and, in that context, I wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

Many families are finding it difficult to meet the cost of sports gear, namely, hurleys, football boots, hockey sticks, rugby balls and kits.  Associations such as the FAI, GAA and IRFU are doing their best.  A gap is being created between the children whose families can afford the cost of kits and those whose families cannot afford them, thus leading to a degree of resentment on the part of children.  Also, a problem arises in regard to what the children who do not have the gear are to do.  Many children who get involved in anti-social behaviour and all the problems generated in that regard do so because they have nothing else to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I have argued long and hard for local authorities, when dealing with planning applications, to ensure play facilities are provided in all housing estates, irrespective of the cost of homes therein.  The quality of local authority housing is excellent as is evident from those I have seen in Kildare.  They are of first-class quality.  In the private sector, in particular, provision is not made for small play areas — these would not take from the overall estate — where children can play among their peers.  This would help us to overcome some of the problems generated by anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The local club with which I am associated provides facilities for 30 to 40 children, who may also play on the local pitch.  However, much more can be done.  I believe that the cost factor is what prohibits many families providing the impetus for their children to get involved in social activities.  Often, children do not get involved in school sports for the same reasons.  Despite the availability of the back to school allowance, the cost to families of sending their children to school is great.  Children should be given an opportunity to get involved in every aspect of social recreation.  It is sad that some children are unable to do so because their families cannot afford kits and so on.  This should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I support the amendment from the perspective of providing an alternative to anti-social behaviour and of drug barons pulling children into their webs.  One can read every day of the week in the newspapers about children as young as ten or 11 years being used as mules for drug barons.  This is reflective of the experience of many of these children who were unable to get involved in the bigger picture of social and community life in their areas.  I support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">No one could argue with the points being made in regard to child poverty.  However, the progression of a second tier of income support is a complex issue.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and Dr. John Sweeney was unable to come up with a solution when it discussed the issue.  What will support our thinking in this regard is the research being conducted in regard to family income supplement, FIS, in terms of low take-up and so on.  As I indicated earlier, I intend to publish that research when I get it.  This research will inform all of our debate on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Child poverty is an issue of concern to all of us.  It was and is an issue of particular concern to Government.  I accept the figures released yesterday show that children continue to be the age group most at risk of poverty.  That is not to suggest 20% of children are living in poverty, rather, 20% are at risk of poverty.  The consistent child poverty rate fell last year.  Obviously, as more people will lose their jobs this year, more children will become dependent on social welfare and that figure will change again next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">Deputy Lynch spoke about <i>Angela’s Ashes</i>.  It was probably the rain rather than the family situation that she did not like.  One of the most exciting and interesting initiatives of my career was the development of the national children’s strategy which gave children a voice for the first time.  What was significant was how the children were able to look beyond the immediate, toys and so on, and to speak about their families in terms of their families being the most important people in their lives.  They were able to articulate their feelings and so on.  While there is a sensitivity there, I do not believe it is a sensitivity in terms of what is the biggest toy Santa can bring.  Adults impose those values on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">As an aside, I recently took my two nephews and niece to the new three-storey toy store in Ireland.  While they were accompanied by their generous aunt, the two boys, despite the availability of every toy a child could want, chose a fire brigade and some lego, which are simple toys.</p>

          <p eId="para_942">Yes.  I think they were boggled by the amount of toys in the store.  We all know that Santa is a generous man, but he too is finding it difficult to come up with all the presents children want this year.  We are trying to address the issue of child poverty in so many ways, including through child benefit, family income supplement and other payments such as the back to school allowance, which we have just discussed, and through encouraging people back into employment and targeting the particularly vulnerable groups such as lone parents.  I cannot say we will within any short timeframe come up with proposals in regard to the second tier.   There is no consensus on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">I would genuinely be interested in hearing from Members on this issue.  Of all the groups at risk of poverty — there have been significant declines in respect of poverty rates for the elderly — children remain the most vulnerable because there is so little they can do for themselves.  Children are dependant on everybody else.  I would genuinely like to hear from Members their views on the second tier issue.  While it is included in the programme for Government, the lack of consensus makes it difficult to address.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_944">The second tier is included in the programme for Government but the lack of consensus makes it difficult.  The Government was aware of the lack of consensus on this when it was included in the programme for Government, which makes one wonder what exactly goes on at the negotiations in regard to what is to be included in that programme.  The programme for Government is like a book of fiction if this is what can be said after the event.  The programme for Government contains commitments in terms of what is to be delivered in five years.  I accept the first line states "in economic circumstances" but the Minister did not make that argument when responding to the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I appreciate the Minister's remarks in respect of the children's strategy and the report of the Ombudsman for Children last year, which dealt mostly with teenagers who also stated that their families are the most important people in their lives.  That is good as it shows that overall children are happy.  However, children not only know the circumstances in which they are living but are aware of the circumstances in which their peers are living, which is where the difficulty arises.  The Minister, as former Minister for Education and Science, and everybody else, will accept that one can tell immediately when one enters a classroom what children are living in poverty, even if one knows nothing about their backgrounds, by the condition of their clothes, hair and skin, which is sad.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">I will not press the amendment.  However, if substantial progress has not been made on this following publication of the report on FIS, I will return to this issue.  While there are many payments available in this area, the reality is that children remain the most vulnerable group and that these payments are not removing enough of them from that group at a rate we would like.  It is important we introduce measures that target children who are most in need.  Currently, this is not being done effectively.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_950">"(3) The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before each House of the Oireachtas, a report on eligibility criteria for the Early Childcare Supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">This amendment relates to the early child care supplement.  The period for which it is given was reduced by six months in the budget and the reason given was that children aged five and a half are at school.  As far as I am aware the age limit at which children start school has not changed since the early child care supplement was introduced. Therefore, that is an unusual argument to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">In regard to the package of cutbacks introduced in this legislation and in other areas, while we can look to outside economic forces, to some degree, as contributing to the current position, the forces at work within Government during the past 11 years have also contributed.  Responsibility must be taken for a failure to achieve as much as we could have when money was available and for the waste of money expended across all Departments during that period.  Furthermore, the way decisions were made and announced to gain the maximum political goodwill, particularly in the run up to an election, has led to some of the problems we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The early child care supplement was introduced without any adequate research being undertaken in this area  On six separate occasions during the previous Dáil Fine Gael asked the then Taoiseach and the then Ministers for Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, the cost of this supplement and on each occasion a different answer was given.  No homework was done before this supplement was introduced.  It is as if it almost came out of the blue to the Government that because the supplement was linked to child benefit, it would have to be paid to parents whose children were living abroad.  This provision was introduced to assist people in meeting the cost of child care in Ireland.  That difficulty for families was the expensive cost of child care provision in Ireland.  As a result of its introduction, Irish parents who still have to pay for expensive child care provision are the ones who are being penalised because not enough homework was done on the reaching of a decision on this matter in the first place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_954">The arguments in this respect are fairly straightforward.  Which one of us as a politician looking for votes would argue against mothers being given extra money in whatever way?  That was probably the reason this measure was introduced in the first instance.  In the run up to the election, following which the early child care supplement was introduced, child care provision was the issue of concern to people we heard on the doorsteps.  The Government introduced the early child care supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">A group met in Buswells today — they have gone now since 1.30 p.m. — regarding the national child care standards in Ireland.  That group along with every other pre-school scheme in the country are lobbying on behalf of these groups.  Most of them who are supposed to be self-sufficient at this stage simply cannot charge mothers — usually they are mothers on low income or mothers who are just finding their way in getting back to employment — the fees necessary to ensure that the schemes continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">We are now facing the first downturn in the economy in many years.  It is a serious one and nobody should dismiss it lightly.  We are looking down the barrel of a gun and we do not know the half of it yet.  No one in here is diminishing the scale of the crisis that is about to hit us and that has already hit some people.  If the money allocated for this child care measure had been directed in a different fashion, our circumstances in terms of child care provision would now be different.  The introduction of this measure was a political ploy deliberately designed to garner votes and, cleverly, it achieved that, but it did not give us the type of infrastructure we need in terms of child care provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">We can all be a little bit cynical and practical at this stage and say that with the downturn in the economy and the amount of women and men coming out of employment there will not be as great a need for child care outside the home.  The difficulty with that philosophy is that we all know that children need the interaction of other children and, in most cases, the type of help and preparation provided outside the home to get them ready for school and to enable them attain their full potential within the education system.  A cutback is proposed in the moneys that were to be distributed to parents of young children.  If we had a proper debate on this matter in the first instance, we would have quickly realised that this measure would not achieve what it was intended to achieve, namely, to increase the number of child care places or to help parents provide the type of child care they wanted for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">We are really arguing about pulling out the plug when we should have been talking, in the first instance, about turning off the tap.  I support the amendment, but we should have had a clearer and fuller debate about this matter before this supplement was introduced.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_959">I support the amendment.  Child care is one of the areas of Government failure.  I do not merely throw that comment across the floor to score a political point.  The critical issue for families is for them to secure a reduction in their child care costs, as this cost is equivalent to a second mortgage.  The difficulty is to find a way to achieve a reduction in this cost.  There are a number of options available to the Government.  It should perhaps have invested in facilities and made those available to people to run child care facilities.  There were many more imaginative approaches that could have been taken outside, apart even from CE schemes, that would have helped facilitate the reduction of child care costs and the provision to parents of far greater access to child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">There is more to the issue than just child care.  I agree with the comment of the previous speaker, Deputy Lynch, on exposing a child to interaction with his or her peers, which is important, but the lack of child care facilities is preventing enterprise, blocking talent in the home and hindering people who could otherwise become entrepreneurs and provide significant job opportunities to society.  It is unfortunate that those people are being hindered in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">Society has changed as a result of the dispersal of people from Dublin and other cities throughout the State to areas such as my own in County Louth or the adjoining counties of Meath and so on.  The extended family support, with which we are all familiar, is no longer available to people to allow them utilise that traditional source of child care, which very often was the parents or the grandparents of the householders.  That is a major difficulty for people trying to deal with this important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I do not heap responsibility for that on the Minster's shoulders.  That is not my intention.  It is a Government failure that the critical area of not only our society's development but our economic development was blind-sided and major opportunities were missed.  I look forward to the day when a Government, sooner rather than later, will recognise the importance of the issue and deal with it comprehensively because a comprehensive impact is required to lessen the burden I have described.  I support the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_325" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_963">The early child care supplement was introduced to support people paying for child care but at the same time the Government had to recognise those people who were looking after their children in their own home, which is the reason the payment was made available to everybody and not, as stated in the Fine Gael proposal, for child care expenses.  That would only be for people most likely working outside the home.  Because it is a family payment under EU rules, it must be paid to people whose children are living abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">We can sometimes lose perspective on this issue.  It is only 1% of the total budget that is paid to children living abroad.  Those rules worked in our favour a number of years ago when Irish men worked in the United Kingdom.  Their families were living here but child benefit in the UK was much better than it was here and Irish families benefited.  Now the shoe is on the other foot and the money is going the other way.  That is an aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">In the context of having to make savings in all Departments, the Office of the Minister for Children determined this was an area where one could make savings but still meet the criteria originally behind it, because it was designed to support people in those years before a child was in full-time school.  The age of six was chosen because that is the compulsory school age but the vast majority of children are in school by the time they are five and a half.  Throughout the country most children are in school by the time they are four or four and a half, so it is still meeting that need for those children.  The amount is €1,100 per year.  Families will continue to get €6,000 for that period up to the time when a child reaches the age of five and a half.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The other change that was introduced related to not paying the money on a quarterly basis.  We discussed the matter last night.  That is utterly reasonable.  One gets the payment from the time the child is born until he or she is five and a half and not for the couple of months before and after.  I accept that should not have been put into the scheme in the first place, but it was done in an effort to recognise the pressures on families and to be as generous as possible in that regard.  It was an additional family payment to support all parents in trying to rear their children, especially in those expensive years when child care is involved.  At least by making the savings in the way we have done, by cutting the age back to five and a half, we recognise that children are in primary school full time by the age of five and a half.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_967">The problem was child care and the solution did not deal with that for many people.  The vouched system to which the Minister referred would at least have been for the cost of child care.  People within the home who are caring for their children would still have been able to avail of it and would like to have been able to avail of it, so the vouched system would have worked for everyone.  Most people would still like the opportunity, be it only to go out to meet other people and to socialise or to attend a part-time course or whatever else.  People would have liked to have been able to avail of that and it would have got over the need to have the money paying for child care in other countries where the costs are negligible compared to what we are paying in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The measure was introduced in a rushed fashion even though there were alternatives.  The Minister's argument about the age of five and a half is contradictory because she admitted that most children have started school by the age of four and a half so if she really believed in her argument she would probably have changed it to four and a half.  The vast majority of children have started school by four and a half and they have certainly started by five.  However, I do not ask the Minister to cut it back further.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">Mistakes were made when the measure was introduced and that is why the Minister has to make cuts at this point.  It may be only 1%, as the Minister indicated, but I am not sure that is the exact figure.  An amount of €8 million is meeting the cost of child care abroad.  The Minister supplied figures yesterday for fraudulent claims of child benefit and this issue is linked because there are fraudulent claims in regard to this payment also and that is costing the taxpayer on the double.  That issue needs to be addressed.</p>

We will continue to do that.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_972">In page 20, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_973">23.—Where a recipient of fuel allowance expresses a preference for the payment of the sums due to him or her by way of two lump sums, it shall be lawful for the Minister to make such payment by way of two lump sums.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The thinking behind the amendment is based on the fact that most local authorities have installed oil-fired central heating in many homes and the cost of fuel.  A senior citizen will have a huge bill once or twice a year.  If the amendment is accepted it would mean they would be able to meet the cost of a fill of oil or to fill the shed with turf or other fuel such as timber.  Currently, the fuel allowance is part and parcel of the main social welfare payment.  It is more and more difficult for senior citizens to meet the cost of filling an oil tank, for example.  The cost of a tank of oil is in excess of €500.  That is a huge amount of money for a senior citizen to come up with twice or even three times a year depending on the size of the house.  If lump sum payments could be made at specific times a person could arrange to fill their oil tank or whatever fuel source they wished.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The amendment is simple and would benefit senior citizens.  The fuel allowance has always been considered of importance to older people to ensure they can afford to have sufficient heat in their homes during the winter months.  Up to now people generally had back burners and one could buy a bag of coal or sticks every week when a person came to the house selling fuel and the money was available to pay for that.  Because local authorities have installed oil-fired central heating the situation has changed and a person is required to have a lump sum to pay for a fill of oil.  It is very difficult to have a large amount of money available, irrespective of how prudent a person is with his or her social welfare payments.  In some instances people seek help from community welfare officers but it is unlikely that they would get a positive reply given that they are in receipt of a fuel allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">This is a simple change that will not put any extra cost on the Exchequer but it would be of great benefit to senior citizens whose lives have changed for the better through the welcome provision of central heating in local authority houses.  In general, a lump sum payment would be of benefit even for senior citizens who do not have central heating systems.  The senior citizens to whom I have spoken are delighted with the changeover to central heating but they have a problem meeting the cost of a fill of oil.  They would welcome a lump sum payment twice a year, as that would allow them to get a fill of oil and they would not have any problem heating their homes for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">By accepting the amendment the Minister would make the lives of those in receipt of the payment easier and that would be to the benefit of everyone.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_978">I support the amendment.  I will be brief because Deputy Wall has outlined what needs to be said.  We were told at a recent committee meeting that a survey was carried out by the Department and a majority of recipients wanted the fuel allowance to continue to be paid on a weekly basis.  Deputy Shortall was mindful of that, which is why she used the phrase, "Where a recipient of fuel allowance expresses a preference".  There is a substantial and growing minority who would prefer to have the fuel allowance paid in two lump sums.  Age Action Ireland conducted research that is more recent than the Department's that showed there is a substantial minority who would prefer two lump sum payments because of the type of heating system they have.  This is an administrative issue.  It will not cost any more money and it would make life easier for many people.  A substantial number of people are not getting enough money in social welfare payments per week to allow them to put money aside to get a fill of oil.  It puts them at an enormous disadvantage and that is why many are not purchasing it.  If one enters their houses, one will discover a two-bar electric radiator plugged in to heat the home.  This is not a solution, particularly for the elderly.  This amendment is extremely important and I hope the Minister will accept it.  I have not had much luck in that respect thus far.</p>

          <p eId="para_979">The fuel allowance scheme is constructive and excellent, which I appreciate.  The additional allowance made available this year, while not enough, is welcome.  However, time has moved on.  To be fair to local authorities, they are installing central heating systems in an increasing number of homes.  They are working their way through their stock at a more reasonable rate than that of recent years and I acknowledge their progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The amendment, which I welcome and support strongly, offers a very practical solution.  We filled our almost-empty tank at home the week before last and it cost €580.  If anyone believes this was a rip-off, he or she should let me know.  People in receipt of fuel allowance are unlikely to be able to raise such a sum without going to a moneylender or another lender.  Other speakers made the point that there is no evidence the amendment will cost the Exchequer an extra cent and I agree with them.  If there is a difficulty with the two-payment system, the Minister should let us know.  It seems straightforward to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">A growing number of people are using oil-fired central heating because of growing refuse charges.  The cost of disposing of ash from coal and timber fires is significant and increasing.  I warmly support the amendment and hope the Minister will accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_982">It is not just pensioners who benefit from the scheme; approximately 300,000 people benefit from the allowance, at a cost of €170 million.  One should also consider those who benefit from the household benefits, which allow them to obtain electricity or gas units.  The total value of the fuel allowance and the household packages amounts to between €1,200 and €1,300 per annum, depending on whether the recipient lives in a smokeless fuel area.  The allowance represents a significant help towards meeting the cost of fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">One difficulty that arises is that one could only make the two payments to somebody in receipt a long-term social welfare payment.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_994">In page 20, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_995">"23.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the need to increase the Living Alone Allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">This is a very important amendment from the Labour Party's perspective because the most vulnerable are those who are living alone.  Unfortunately I was not present yesterday when the clawback of the rent subsidy was discussed.  Those living alone, especially senior citizens, will really suffer because of it.  They may go to the post office on 1 January 2009 and receive a new book stating they have received an increase of €6.95 but, on the same day, they will receive a document from the HSE stating their rent has increased by €5.  I cannot believe the Minster did this.  It is unbelievable and the most horrendous act of any in this area.  We have discussed landlords, etc., at length and know from visiting the individuals in question that they are the poorest of the poor, yet the clawback was made. There was no logic to it and it was mean and unacceptable.  The clawback, in so far as it will affect individuals living alone and senior citizens, will come back to haunt us.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I heard the Minister state rent did not increase in four years.  So what?  If it has not increased, the Minister should put in place a mechanism whereby the most desirable scheme will be realised over the coming four years.  The taking of €5 from individuals in one fell swoop was the worst of all the 32 cuts.  It represents a false dawn for those affected.  When they get the book into their hands, they will expect to receive the money indicated therein.  On the following day, they will see that €5 of the rent subsidy has been clawed back.  There is an urgent need to consider the position of those living alone.  There is no doubt but that they are the most vulnerable, regardless of age or circumstances.  Some of them are in horrendous circumstances due to rogue landlords, who, in many instances, have them in fear of seeking alternative accommodation.  The landlords say they will not return the tenants' deposits and that they will take cases on foot of the tenants doing this, that and the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">This amendment is the most important of all.  I ask the Minister to consider, when reviewing the budget, the introduction of some mechanism to address the clawback, although it may not be possible by accepting my amendment.  It was a horrendous act to do that to senior citizens, giving them the idea they would get €7 when, in real terms, they will get €2.  I ask the Minister to look at this.  These are the most vulnerable people in society.  They visit me in my clinics, or I visit them and see the conditions in which they live.  There is a need to increase the living alone allowance and this issue is tied in with the previous amendment on the fuel allowance.  Both are important to the people concerned.  It is vitally important that they have a satisfactory living, one that is acceptable to all of us.  None of us wishes to see people come under pressure or to see a situation where the people who are in receipt of these payments now find it difficult to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">This amendment offers a way to overcome that.  I ask the Minister to consider it, and to look at the clawback in respect of the increase in the rent subsidy.  It is wrong to do this.  Local government rules contain a clause whereby nobody in local authority housing is allowed suffer that situation.  I am not sure about the details, but a circular letter was sent by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to local authorities in 2004, in which he gave a directive that they could not take any more than 15% of any social welfare rise for rents.  This was especially the case for senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I cannot understand how the Minister agreed to take 60% or 70% from senior citizens in this instance.  This is not acceptable given the cost of living and all the rises in electricity, gas, fuel and transport.  Everything has gone up and yet the Minister hammered those people.  She hammered the senior citizens and those who are least well off in society by clawing back this payment from them.  In a throwaway remark that I happened to hear one night, the Minister said the payment had not risen in four years.  It is nobody's fault other than the Government's that it had not risen during that time.  If it had risen year by year, the Minister would have conformed to the local authority directive that only 15% of the rise should be taken back.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">I ask the Minister to consider the living alone allowance.  I ask her to reflect on the clawback in the rent subsidy increase and make it possible for the person living alone, man or woman, in whatever circumstances, to have his or her standard of living improve to a level acceptable to us all.</p>

          <p eId="para_1002">When a person finds himself or herself in a position to be eligible for the living alone allowance, the reality is that the only expense in the house that lessens is that of clothes and perhaps, in a small way, of food.  Every other household bill remains the same as if two people were in the house.  This has been brought home to me time and again by people who find themselves in this position.  Their income has reduced because now only one payment comes in and they find it impossible.  The cost of everything, oil, insurance, car, etc., must be met by a single person.  It is very difficult and we must examine the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">I thought the Minister was considering this issue prior to the budget but that does not appear to be the case.  I support the amendment because I believe this difficulty must be addressed.  It has not been addressed in many years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1004">I concur with what the previous two speakers said.  One can sit down and do the simple mathematics here, taking the case of a couple, both on old age pensions.  One can see that, in comparison to somebody on a pension living alone, their circumstances are astronomically better.  Nobody suggests for one minute that where there is a couple living together on a pension they should suffer in any way.  If there is one group, apart from children, in danger of living in consistent poverty, it is people who rely on State benefit and live alone.  As Deputy Enright rightly said, the cost of heating one's accommodation is the same, repairs and maintenance are the same and the cost of food is the same.  There are all the expenses of a household but on a very limited income.  The living alone allowance is the way to deal with this.  That way, no other group is detrimentally affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">We must take a serious look at this.  It is not right to allow this group of people to suffer.  They have been there all along and it is ten years since this allowance was increased.  It is very worrying that the Minister has allowed this situation to happen.  The allowance is the mechanism to treat it.  I urge the Minister to take a serious look at this and to accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_341" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1006">It has been policy for a number of years in my Department not to increase the living alone allowance but to put all the increases into primary payments so that all pensioners benefit.  I fully accept that a person who suddenly finds himself or herself in the position of living alone has all the expenses as were outlined.  The house does not become any smaller and must be heated etc.  The policy has been to try to increase all the payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Deputy Enright is correct that I was sympathetic to this issue prior to the budget.  I made the unusual statement last week on Committee Stage that if I had received more money, or less money, in the budget package I might have been able to do something about this.  If I had received less money, I would have targeted fuel and living alone allowances.  If I had more money, I might have been able to provide the increase we gave, the €7 in the pension, plus the living alone allowance.  It fell the way it did.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Despite the fact that this has been policy over the past number of years, I have a certain sympathy for people who find themselves living alone, particularly those on a very limited income.  It just was not possible to deal with the matter this year and there will be many hurdles to get over in the future in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Poverty statistics show clearly that people living alone are much more at risk, whether they are of working age, lone parents or pensioners.  Arguments could be made in favour of this allowance.  However, given the amount in the budget this year, and in order to try to give everybody increases of 3.5%, it was not possible to put the money into the living alone allowance.  The 3.5% increase will now be substantially ahead of inflation next year, given the way inflation figures are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">With regard to Deputy Wall's point about the rent supplement, it is true the rent supplement has not been increased.  The personal contribution has not been increased in four years but in that time social welfare payments increased by €70.  It was always the intention that the rent supplement would be about 10% of the basic social welfare payment and it is important to try to catch up with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">If the people in question were to go into a council house, apartment or flat in the morning, they would end up on the lowest line of the differential rate, at €26 or more, in Dublin or Limerick, for instance and would have to take an immediate hike.  With the pressure we are putting on councils to house people it would be an even bigger burden for them to have a very big increase.  The aim is to try to bring the basic minimum contribution that a person on rent supplement pays in line with the differential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">I accept the point that smaller steps might have been easier over the past few years but, for different reasons, and because money was more flúirseach——</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">I accept that and that there is a differential between a person in a local authority, and one on rent subsidy but I cannot accept that the clawback should be such a high percentage of the increase in social welfare payment.  I have no problem that the Minister should try to bring this in line, raising it over a period of time.  I accept that should be the way.  However, the fact that 60% or 70% is being taken back in one fell swoop, because people expect they will get €7 of an increase, is a big problem.   I guarantee that the people who are expecting that do not anticipate a second whammy, namely, that they will have to pay €5 extra when the cheque arrives from the community welfare officer.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">This relates to the ever-increasing numbers on the live register.  The late Deputy Séamus Brennan, God rest him, as former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, accepted that the period of time at that stage, 15 months — which had come about as one of the savage cuts implemented by the present Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan — was too long and he brought it back to 12 months.  At that time Deputy Willie Penrose was calling for it to be nine months but the then Minister, former Deputy Brennan, was not in a position to do that because of the budgetary constraints.  However, times have changed dramatically, and I believe this is an opportunity for the Minister to look at this.  Twelve months is too long a period to be on social welfare payments before a person may go back to education.  The first time a person may contemplate going back to education is when or she is laid off from work, and has to make a decision.  If he or she decides on going back to education, naturally, he or she wants to start as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">However, the 12 month period is far too long.  We believe it should only be three months.  There is a decrease in the numbers entering third level and the universities still have places to fill.  Given the world situation, there may be a decrease in the numbers of foreign students coming here, and given all the statements from the university presidents as regards funding costs etc., places are available in all faculties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">A good friend finally got into the system after the frustrations of having to wait for more than a year.  He is now pursuing a master's degree course having successfully taken his primary degree.  However, he had to suffer the frustration of waiting for a year before he could start, which is far too long.  We now have an opportunity to act, bearing in mind the plight of so many who have lost their employment, and who must now make a decision as regards further education.  It must be remembered that many of those now unemployed include people who dropped out of university and even second level, to avail of the opportunity to earn high wages when the construction industry was at its height.  We now have the opposite situation, and many of those would be willing, capable and able to move onto third level, if given the opportunity.  However, a 12-month wait is far too long, and now is an ideal time to reactivate educational opportunities for these people, and for that reason the Minister should accept this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1023">This issue has been debated back and forth, at Question Time and during earlier Stages of this Bill.  The Minister acknowledges that the allowance is important, and yet there have been no changes in this  year's budget that might make it easier for people to qualify.  I am particularly concerned about two categories in this regard.  First, in order to enter third level education, people have to be unemployed and must be on the live register for a year.  The second category refers to people on the minimum wage.  Both categories are important, but having failed to persuade the Minister with regard to the first, I suspect it will be virtually impossible to persuade her of the value of the second.  I cannot ignore the fact that people with ability in low paid jobs should be given the opportunity to avail of this as well, but today I shall concentrate on the plight of the unemployed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">This is extremely important, not only in terms of giving people a second chance but also providing many with their first opportunity of entering third level education.  When we have discussed this on a number of occasions recently, the Minister has always replied to the effect that people who are made redundant can get it, as can those in a national education action plan, NEAP, area.  However, of the 9,796 participating in 2008, those who got statutory redundancy amounted to 113 and those in NEAP areas came to 75.  Those figures were not used in all the time we have been discussing this issue.  It means in effect that the number qualifying for the back to education allowance under statutory redundancy and NEAP guidelines is less than 200.  It makes a nonsense of the replies we have received to date.  They were factually correct, but the reality is that significantly more people are not getting the back to education allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I do not know about other Members, but I receive more queries regarding third level than second level because of the fact that the waiting period is a year.  The Minister has said on "Prime Time", in the House and so on that the numbers participating are increasing, which is the case.  However, that increase is at second level.  When one looks at the figures for 2007-08, the numbers who have used the back to education allowance to access third level have dropped by more than 100 on the previous year.  Therefore the back to education allowance is not working, particularly for people who want to go to third level, and it is very difficult to qualify.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I made the point before that if a person is unemployed, having been laid off in October, he or she will not be eligible by the following October, not having been on social welfare for 12 months.  Effectively, he or she is waiting almost two years, certainly 23 months, before availing of the allowance, in those circumstances.  A change to this makes common sense from the perspective of giving people an opportunity to go to third level.  It also makes sense because all it will cost the Exchequer more per person per year is the €500 extra payment he or she gets under this allowance.  I therefore urge the Minister to accept these amendments and make a change in this regard because it is an extremely important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">With regard to Deputy Shortall's amendment No. 31, will the Minister outline the criteria for the type of employment considered for the back to work allowance?  How is it assessed and decided and what types of payments are made for what types of work?  Is it a question of getting into a job or are ancillary costs taken into account regarding such work?</p>

          <p eId="para_1028">It is regrettable we only have ten minutes left, because we could have done with an extra two days, at least.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, continually mentions a high knowledge economy, as do the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  We have an opportunity with amendment No. 30 to do this and to facilitate people getting back into education, or in some cases to attend third level for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The amazing thing about the amendment is that it is cost neutral as the Exchequer would be making the payment in any event, whether jobseekers allowance or benefit.  Therefore, I hope the Minister can explain the difficulty in terms of bringing the qualifying time back to the three-month period.  Now that the number of unemployed people is increasing — currently 275,000 plus and I heard Fr. Seán Healy say this morning the number could reach 400,000 by late next year — surely they would be better off if they were gainfully employed in education rather than seeking employment that, in the majority of cases, will not be available.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">I support the amendments on the back to education allowance.  I urge the Minister to be conscious that many young people who are now unemployed left the education scene just before or after their leaving certificate, lured into employment by the attractive incomes and salaries available in the building industry and other manufacturing industries with opportunities for overtime.  Many of these people are now unemployed, increasing numbers of them having become unemployed during the past six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The Minister must, as a result of the many courses available currently and the many places unfilled within the education system at third level, recognise the opportunity available to her to shorten the period for which people must be out of work before they can avail of the back to education allowance.  If we are serious and determined to ensure that as many people as possible can avail of the opportunity to improve and upskill, why create a hindrance to allowing them back into education?  I support the amendments wholeheartedly.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the criteria and to consider including distance learning as an option for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1032">I support the amendments.  More people are looking to return to college because of the level of unemployment and their awareness of the need to upgrade their skills and more inquiries are being made in our offices about the back to education allowance.  In the current climate, it makes sense to facilitate those who wish to return to third level education in the hope of increasing their skills and their employment prospects, rather than forcing them to remain out of work and draw social welfare or the jobseekers allowance in order to be eligible for the back to education allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The loss of income is substantial if a person goes off the jobseekers allowance.  A person on a low income wishing to return to education is only entitled to €4,103 per year in educational support, whereas a person with a social welfare background is entitled to €25,266 a year.  Over a three-year degree course, this amounts to a €63,489 disparity in essential support.  This anomaly limits the incentive for low-paid workers to return to full-time third level education to improve their skills and future job prospects.  Essentially, people who want to escape the low-paid trap are penalised for working.  Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">This is one of the common sense amendments that has been tabled to the Bill.  The amendment must work out cost neutral.  Even if it was not cost neutral, the Minister would still have to pay the allowance in the future to people interested in returning to education, whether at second or third level.  The money must be paid anyway.  Therefore, I cannot understand why the Government will continue to allow people become entrenched in long-term employment when the solution is there.  Now that we expect to see the type of savings in FÁS that we should have seen over the past eight years, why not spend those savings on the people on whom it should have been spent?</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">Deputy Tuffy informed us recently that the universities had spare capacity of 12,000 places after all offers were made in October.  The universities are crying out for funding and we now have a redundant workforce crying out for education.  Why not marry one with the other?  It is incomprehensible for the Minister not to do this as it is a common sense proposal.  I appeal to the Minister to take this suggestion on board.  Let us upskill the workforce as FÁS puts it so that we ensure that when the upturn comes, as it will, we will have a workforce prepared for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">As Deputies know, I am usually committed to the back to education concept for everybody, particularly those who are most vulnerable and those on social welfare.  One of the few positive features of the live register published yesterday was the 24% increase in the number of people availing of back to education provisions.  The fact there may be more at second level rather than third level is reflective of the vulnerability of that particular group.</p>

This is a scheme that is in place to support people who are on social welfare.  If we changed the provisions, we could get young people finishing their leaving certificate in June and signing on for three months and getting €200 a week despite the fact they fully intended to go on to third level education.

          <p eId="para_1044">People on the national employment action plan also have a shorter timeframe.  I am working with my colleagues, the Ministers for Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with regard to FÁS and the spare capacity in the institutes of technology, universities and further education courses to see how we can support these people.  It can be done through FÁS and through training or through the back to education allowance.  We are actively working on this to see how we can facilitate the maximum number of people possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The scheme is not cost neutral.  Last year, it cost €62 million and it will cost more this year and next as, hopefully, many more people will be on the scheme.  People going on the scheme get the maximum rate of the allowance.  Therefore, a person on half rate jobseekers allowance for some reason, such as working part-time, will get the maximum rate as soon as he or she qualifies for back to education allowance, along with the book allowance, etc.  As late as this morning, I spoke with officials about ensuring that nobody is in any way disadvantaged by virtue of the changes in the criteria for the jobseekers benefit.  We have seen to that to ensure the window that has always been allowed will continue to be allowed.  My aim and intention are to ensure we encourage as many people as possible, particularly those becoming unemployed, to avail of the back to education scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I will keep the situation under review over the next few months to see how we can support these people.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian Hayes</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of uncertified sick days taken by teachers in 2007-08. 
        [44581/08]

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1178">The information requested by the Deputy is normally provided on a school year basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">The average level of uncertified sick leave combined for the total cohort of primary teachers was 1.98 days and 2.81 days for teachers in secondary and community-comprehensive schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">The average level of uncertified sick leave, for which substitution cover was claimed, combined for the total cohort of primary teachers was 1.31 days and 1.6 days for teachers in secondary and community-comprehensive schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">The number of days uncertified sick leave taken by primary teachers in the 2007-08 school year was 60,128.  Teachers in secondary, community and comprehensive schools took 48,136 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">In the 2007-08 school year my Department paid for substitute cover in respect of 39,921 days uncertified sick leave taken by primary teachers, and 27,730 days taken by teachers in secondary and community and comprehensive schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">Teachers employed by vocational education committees are paid by the 33 individual committees.  The payroll costs incurred by the committees, including the cost of substitution, are claimed on a monthly basis from the Department and the Department does not have a breakdown of the specific data for VECs.  Therefore, data provided on the VECs is estimated on the basis that the cost, days claimed and the level of absences are 56% of the total of the secondary and community-comprehensive schools.  The 56% figure is based on relative teacher numbers in the different second level sectors.  On that basis, the estimated number of days uncertified sick leave taken by teachers employed by vocational education committees was approximately 27,000 and the estimated number of days paid for by vocational education committees was approximately 15,500.</p>

I refer him to the following comment he made on 20 November last to the Joint Committee on Education and Science, that "on Mondays throughout 2008 there were in excess of 12,500 teachers absent on uncertified sick leave and that there was a similar number absent on Fridays".  Does he now withdraw that comment, which deliberately misled the members of that committee?</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">Added to the slur is the dirty little war that the Minister has fought over the past month with Irish teachers who are doing their best and who have one of the lowest rates of absenteeism of any workforce in the country.  Will the Minister withdraw that comment and, in doing so, will he be man enough to apologise for the outrageous slur he put on the record of a committee of this House?</p>

        <b>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if he will confirm that the overall average primary school class size of 24.1 which obtained in 2005-06 and 2006-07 according to a previous parliamentary question will remain the same in the 2009-10 school year; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [44589/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_405" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1230">Class size data for primary schools is compiled by my Department on an annual  basis.  The source of this data is the annual census of primary schools.  Data for each school year is made available when returns for all schools in respect of the year in question have been processed.  Schools will not be making returns in respect of the 2009-10 school year until after 30 September 2009 and, allowing for obtaining returns from all schools and the normal checking and processing of this data, the position will be known in summer 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">However, since the changes to the staffing schedule for primary schools announced on budget day restore the basis of allocation of teachers to schools to the position that applied in the 2006-07 school year, it is a reasonable working assumption that average class size in 2009-10 should be quite similar.  Schools have flexibility in the way in which they assign pupils and teachers to classes and the Department does not allocate teachers to specific classes or age groups.  That is why precise information to enable compilation of the national average position is not available until the position in individual schools is captured through the census.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">In any discussion of class size and classes where the number of pupils exceed the average it is important to understand how the main staffing schedule sets out to treat schools in like circumstances in a fair and consistent manner.  The current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and the fact that schools make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups.  With over 20,000 individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will always be differences in individual class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally what the final impact will be on the overall changes in aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009-10 school year and this applies to final average class size as well.  I reiterate that prudent management of Government finances is vital at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context.  It means primary schools will be staffed exactly as they were during the 2006-07 school year during which they operated well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1239">I understand the point that the Deputy is making and respect his opinion.  I hope, however, he can appreciate that we have a difficulty in this regard.  The Department has received 4,300 written and oral questions, which is 13% of the total number of parliamentary questions.  The amount of man hours required to answer them is substantial.  I am the first to admit that we have to make improvements.  We want to develop a more effective procedure and we are working on our information technology systems to increase our efficiency.  If the Deputy wishes to raise certain issues, I am willing to arrange for him to meet officials of my Department so that we can rectify whatever difficulties may have arisen.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">I appreciate that.  I will make two observations to the Minister.  When the beef tribunal was in full flight, its chairperson stated that if Ministers had answered questions honestly, openly and accurately in the Dáil, the tribunal would never have been necessary.  When the Departments of Post and Telegraphs and Social Welfare experienced telephone chaos, the numbers of questions put down by frustrated Deputies exploded because their constituents could not get a straight reply from the Departments in question.  The Department of Education and Science will continue to attract 13% of parliamentary questions if it does not answer them properly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1242">I am aware of the number of questions that are tabled.  They reflect a drawback in our system.  Since I have taken on this position, I have assigned a dedicated line for Deputies to contact an official in the Department when they have particular issues they want to have investigated.  That official is assigned to facilitate Members of this House.  I hope we can thereby dramatically reduce the number of questions submitted to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1244">I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly in regard to the process of developing a new national strategy for higher education.  It is envisaged the process will be led by a high level steering group which will provide  business, student, wider community and international perspectives.  Senior officials from key Departments will also participate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The development of a national strategy provides an important opportunity to bring together in a coherent manner our stated ambitions for the sector and to set out the systems which we will use to achieve these ambitions.  Furthermore, by its very nature, the process of developing a national strategy provides an opportunity to engage in consultations with those who have an interest in the sector, enhance the quality of the analysis and recommendations and generate a shared understanding of the needs and challenges of the sector, together with a commitment to the change that will be needed to underpin implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">The strategy will provide for a survey of the operational environment for higher education and research, an analysis of the demands likely to be placed on the system and a review of capacity to meet those demands.  A review will be conducted of the effectiveness of current use of resources with a view to identifying potential for rationalisation or change to maximise the use of those resources and how additional resource requirements to support the achievement of stated objectives can be met over the medium term.  Clear strategic guidance will be provided for the development of the sector and of individual institutions and types of institutions within it.  Structures will be developed to oversee the planning and development of the system, as well as ensuring quality and accountability.  Membership of the steering group is currently under consideration and I do not  propose to speculate or comment on any particular names until all are agreed.</p>

It has taken us a very long time to get to the stage of announcing this strategy.

            <p eId="para_1252">With regard to the chairmanship, I agree we need somebody of outstanding ability and achievement.  He or she should have a very good knowledge of the third level sector and be able to direct and guide this process for the next 20 years.  From my perspective and that of the Government, finding the best person to chair this body will be paramount.  Politics will not come into play in what I see as being one of the most strategic roles to be played for the next 20 years in terms of developing an educational strategy.</p>

Will the Minister further outline his strategy in terms of the establishment of this higher level group?  As I understand it, he has asked as one of the first functions to bring forward a report on the potential funding arrangement for third level and higher education in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Does the Minister agree that it would be much more sensible to have the vision and the issue of funding dealt with at the same time?  If the Minister is proposing to consider funding first, without looking at the broader remit of vision for higher education — which I referred to two weeks ago in a speech at my own party conference — it will effectively put the cart before the horse.  We need both issues to be addressed at the same time rather than rushing in to a funding solution — or not as the case may be — without looking at the wider issues of quality, participation and where exactly we want higher education to be in 20 years.</p>

I also wanted to have an opportunity for in-depth discussions with various people relating to the higher education strategy.  I will not be looking at one in isolation of the other; both issues will be considered in tandem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">I see in-depth knowledge of future student commitment as being separate from the overall strategy.  The issues will impinge on each other but will coincide in terms of any discussions taking place.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_420" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1258">The subjects social, personal and health education, physical education and home economics at second level cover, among elements of the syllabus, the areas of healthy eating and the food pyramid, healthy lifestyle, physical health, body care, exercise, relaxation and diet.  They are evaluated in schools by the inspectorate using indicators specific to primary and to second level schools as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Schools in Ireland have a strong and proud tradition of developing sport outside of the school timetable.  Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.  Schools have worked on devising healthy lunches policies as part of social, personal and health education, SPHE, and physical education, PE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The curriculum support services at primary and post-primary level have a number of activities in place to promote healthy living in schools and healthy eating policies. Planning templates to assist in school planning for the implementation of the PE curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport are also available.  In addition, extensive opportunities for professional development for teachers are provided in this area, including in SPHE, PE and home economics.  The majority of schools currently participating in the school completion programme operate breakfast clubs or other meal provisions, in accordance with the nutritional guidelines issued by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">A special PE funding package of €6.5 million issued in 2006 to primary schools, and in 2007 a similar package of €3 million issued to post-primary schools.  The Food Dudes programme is being rolled out on a national basis to all primary schools over a five-year period and my Department also promotes Sport for All Day, the Active School Awards and National Healthy Eating Week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">The task force recommended that all schools should provide for 30 minutes of physical exercise each day, restructuring the school day if necessary.  While schools can encourage pupils to take physical exercise during breaks, the extension of the time available in the curriculum for PE is not feasible in terms of the range of curricular options which must be facilitated and the industrial relations and cost implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Schools are playing their part in the battle to tackle childhood obesity.  However, it should be remembered that children only spend 20% of their time at school and that a healthy home environment is vital to ensuring they do not suffer from obesity.  The State of the Nation's Children report launched in 2007 shows that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking second across the 32 WHO countries surveyed in being physically active for at least four hours per week.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1264">The Minister mentioned facts a few moments ago in a reply to Deputy Hayes on another question.  There were 22 recommendations from the task force and I hoped the Minister would tell me how many were implemented with regard to primary and secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">The Minister mentioned home economics as a vehicle for providing healthy lifestyle and eating.  Does the Minister agree that the recent withdrawal of the home economics grant through the budget cutbacks is a setback to the implementation of obesity policy in second level schools?  The Minister mentioned the great work done by the various sporting organisations so does the Minister agree that the recent cutbacks in substitution — the figure of €13 million was mentioned — will have a devastating effect on the implementation of obesity policy in our schools?  The Minister stated that Ireland is faring well but my figures indicate there were over 300,000 obese children in our schools, and this was growing by over 10,000 each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">One of the recommendations is that home school community co-ordinators should incorporate healthy skills within a wider framework of home visitation.  What does the Minister say to the nine or ten voluntary schools in my constituency that will lose their home school liaison officer and will not be able to implement some of the recommended provisions?</p>

            <p eId="para_1267">I cannot comment on individual schools.  It is appropriate that I mention here that at all times I was open to having discussions with the various education partners.  When they came to meet me, they indicated they may have some suggestions and I indicated to the education committee that discussions were going on in the background.  I bring it to the attention of the Dáil that those discussions have continued and proposals have been made by second level management bodies.  These have identified that annual savings of €16 million on substitution can be made not only in the current year but on a continuing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">These savings essentially involve replacing an open-ended or demand-led availability of cover for uncertified sick leave and official school business costing €21 million per annum with an allocated or budgeted scheme costing €5 million per annum.  This is a constructive and positive approach and I will make €2.7 million available to secondary schools for the remainder of the school year to provide each school with a limited number of hours of substitution cover outside of the supervision and substitution scheme.  During this period, I intend for there to be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme in conjunction with school management bodies and teachers' unions with a view to taking up the additional €2.7 million expenditure.  I will also be open to similar constructive suggestions from the primary school management bodies.</p>

In terms of the constructive negotiations, having left the door open for discussion and realising that I do not want to affect schools into the new year, it would be sensible of us for the moment to take an approach that will deliver supervision and substitution within schools.  In this way, I will get the majority of the savings for which I am looking.</p>

        <b>Deputy Ulick Burke</b>

         if, in view of the contents of reports from the Health and Safety Authority, the risk assessment report and the Health Service Executive report on the conditions at a school (details supplied) in County Galway, he will sanction the provision of a new school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_431" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1278">An application for capital funding towards the provision of a new school building was received in April from the school referred to by the Deputy.  This was the first such application from the school.  On foot of it and information supplied by the school regarding its condition, officials from the planning and building unit of my Department visited the school in June.  Consequently, €26,862 was sanctioned to carry out remedial works to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">In November, the school invited the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, to inspect the building.  The HSA inspector served an improvement notice on the board of management directing that "a new safety statement based on site-specific risk assessment must be compiled by a competent person and implemented at this place of work".  It is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have an up-to-date safety statement in place in their schools.  Following receipt of the HSA report, my Department has sanctioned funding for the school to engage a qualified health and safety consultant to survey it and to assist the school authority in compiling an up-to-date safety statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The school principal also invited the department of public health of the HSE to inspect the school.  A copy of the report of the HSE representative who visited the school was forwarded to my Department in mid-November.  The report advised that one classroom should be temporarily closed due to evidence of damp penetration and fungal growth.  I understand that the fungal growth has been safely removed and that the classroom is back in use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The school, which has a current enrolment of 49 pupils, is situated in a rural area.  As such, it would have been a suitable candidate for the small schools scheme, introduced by my Department in 2003.  The scheme was targeted at small rural schools and provided funding for more than 730 such schools around the country.  One of the key principles of the scheme was that responsibility for project management was devolved to individual school authorities for the purposes of refurbishing and-or extending existing buildings in order to address the schools' long-term accommodation needs.  However, my Department has no record of having received an application under the scheme from this school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">Department records show that, in the past five years, the school received €33,917 under the grant scheme for minor works to national schools.  Works that can be covered under this scheme are improvements to school buildings and grounds, the improvement or replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of standard furniture and physical education equipment, the purchase of floor covering and window blinds and the purchase of IT-related equipment.  My Department has been in contact with the school regarding the use of these funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">My Department is in ongoing contact with the school regarding its needs.  The Deputy will be aware that I requested officials from my Department to visit the school.  A member of the inspectorate and officials from my Department's building unit are arranging to visit the school on Thursday, 11 December.  In light of the many competing demands on my Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give any commitment relating to the provision of a new building for the school at this time.</p>

On behalf of the board of management, parents' association, staff, students and community, I wish to put two important facts on the record.  The new board of management was established in November 2007 and the principal was appointed in September 2007.  They cannot take responsibility for anything that occurred beforehand.  The Department's request concerning moneys and grants spent is irrelevant.</p>

            <p eId="para_1293">The Deputy will understand that the letter to the school needed to be sent through the Secretary General, who is subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Some €33,917.44 was provided between 2003 and 2007.  According to the information to hand, only €19,000 can be accounted for, leaving a potential balance of €14,610.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">During the 2007-08 school year, a new security camera was purchased for €3,500.  During the 2006-07 school year, €384.53 was spent on minor works.  It is appropriate that my Department ask the pertinent question of the school, namely, where did the balance go and, if there is such a deficiency in the school, why was the minor works money not used to upgrade it in the appropriate manner.  It would be inconsistent of us to do otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">The situation begs another question.  Why did the school only make an application in April 2008 for a new school to be built?  Considering the area's topography, there are five small schools therein, some comprising approximately 14 pupils or fewer than 20 pupils.  In these circumstances, it is appropriate for me as Minister to ask what opportunities for amalgamation of those small rural schools are available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1297">While expenditure on a security camera may not be seen as a priority in the Department's eyes, the school's dilapidated appearance led to a high degree of vandalism.  That has since ceased.  As a matter of urgency, I ask the Minister to consider an offer on the table.  A new school would be built on site without any disruption and at no cost to the Department other than the cost of the lease.  It could be done quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">The Minister mentioned he is considering a priority scheme.  I hope this school will be afforded top priority within that scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1299">If five small schools are situated within two miles of each other, it is appropriate to ask whether there is a possibility that they might amalgamate.  We asked the board of management of the school in question to consider the possibility of an amalgamation.  It is a matter for the board of management to decide whether such an amalgamation would be appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1303">I am actually adhering to that policy.

            <p eId="para_1304">The application in respect of the school in question was received in April last.  The board of management at the school is effectively stating that it wishes to jump the queue and have its application considered before any others.  I will consider the position as it relates to the school.  If the board of management indicates that it does not wish to become involved in an amalgamation, I will be obliged to examine the matter in that context and in light of all the other applications that have been received.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         his views on a newspaper article (details supplied) regarding the issue of bogus teachers taking up teaching positions in schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [44203/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_447" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1306">I am concerned by the newspaper report to which the Deputy refers.  This matter serves as a timely reminder of the importance of carrying out adequate checks when school staff are being recruited.  The recruitment and selection of staff whether for teaching or other positions in a school rests with boards of management, as employers.  Good practice should involve the checking of recent employment records, qualifications, experience and names of referees.  While many substitute teachers have previous experience of working in schools and may be known to the authorities in particular schools, there is clearly a heightened requirement for vigilance in checking the prior employment record where the person seeking employment is not known to the school or is approaching it for the first time.  Good practice is warranted in any event, regardless of the specific issue with regard to safeguarding against any child protection risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">In the context of child protection, the arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department circular 0094/2006, which issued to all schools in June 2006.  This circular is available on my Department's website.  The arrangements for vetting new teachers at the time of their initial registration with the Teaching Council — regardless of whether they are likely to enter permanent employment or take up appointments as substitute or part-time teachers — were introduced in 2006.  The procedures also apply to prospective employees for posts that involve working with children, such as those relating to special needs assistants, bus drivers, bus escorts for children with special needs, caretakers and other ancillary staff in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">As the expansion of service by the Garda vetting unit is rolled out, my Department will be consulting the relevant education stakeholders on how best to introduce vetting of existing teachers that are working in any capacity — permanent, part-time or substitute — in the school system and other existing education staff working with children.  The circular requires the vetting of any person being appointed to a teaching position — whether permanent, part-time or substitute — who has not been employed in the school system in the previous three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Irrespective of the position on vetting by the Garda vetting unit, where facts or information come to a board of management's attention calling into question a person's suitability to work with children, it is a matter for the board to be satisfied that the person is suitable to work in that capacity.  The position will naturally have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  A board of management will be obliged to consider the various circumstances of the case, give due weight to all relevant factors and afford fair procedures to the individual concerned before making a decision.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1310">I am extremely concerned by the blasé, hands-off attitude displayed by the Minister in respect of this serious incident, which was reported in <i>The Sunday Times</i>.  Two journalists were able to use aliases in order to gain entry to a school and teach two separate classes.  Neither their qualifications nor their standing as teachers was checked by the authorities at the school.  The Minister has adopted a kind of hands-off approach and stated that this is a matter for schools and that schools must be aware of the contents of the 2006 circular from his Department.  Is he not concerned that someone who does not possess any relevant qualifications can log on to a website, gain entry to a school and then teach 20 or 30 students?</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">In his initial reply, the Minister commented on vetting.  I did not inquire about that matter.  However, in the case to which I refer, there was no indication that the two people involved were qualified teachers.  Is the Minister concerned about this matter?  What further measures does he intend to put in place to ensure that incidents of this kind will not happen in the future?  Would it not be sensible for his Department to be involved in the construction of a system that would guarantee that substitute teachers possess the requisite qualifications.  Will the Minister treat this issue with greater seriousness?</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">I would not like the Deputy to impute that I am in any way not treating this matter seriously.  I was quite concerned by the newspaper article to which the Deputy referred.  This matter serves as a timely reminder of the importance of carrying out adequate checks when school staff are being recruited.  I have asked my officials to bring to the attention of all schools the difficulties to which this case has given rise.  As already stated, all schools must, as employers, be vigilant in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Schools must be made aware of the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, website, which contains a "text-a-sub" service.  It would be appropriate that any school taking on a substitute teacher who is not known to it would, in the first instance, require that details of his or her teaching qualifications be provided.  As the Deputy is aware, all teachers are obliged to register with the Teaching Council.  It would also be appropriate for the school to establish details of an individual's background in teaching.  Every effort must be made to obtain the relevant information in order that it might be established that a substitute teacher's qualifications and behaviour reach the required standard.</p>

Deputy Brian Hayes and I are stating that the Department must be much more proactive in respect of these matters.  The Minister cannot step back and state that these issues must be dealt with by schools.  Some of the comments he made in his reply to Deputy Brian Hayes's supplementary question were of far more assistance than the information contained in his initial reply.  I agree with the Minister in respect of the IPPN, which is an excellent organisation.  In the context of bogus universities, which do terrible damage to the third level sector in this country, and bogus or unqualified teachers, is there not an onus on the Department to move from first gear straight to top gear in the context of becoming more proactive?</p>

Does the Minister believe it is good enough that an excellent organisation such as the IPPN must devise a website and system to ensure we have an adequate supply of qualified substitute teachers?

The schools in question are satisfied with them.  However, it is far more appropriate to have a qualified rather than unqualified teacher acting as a substitute.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1329">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 33 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Students who qualify for a maintenance grant for their attendance on a recognised full-time approved course in a third level institution or PLC centre may also qualify for the higher, special rate of maintenance grant if they satisfy the relevant terms and conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant, usually referred to as the "top-up" grant, an applicant must qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the relevant academic year.  In addition, total reckonable income must not exceed a specified amount which for the 2008-09 academic year, namely,  €20,147 in the 2007 tax year.  Finally, the source of income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The number of students qualifying for the special rate of grant is now in excess of 13,500.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department of Social and Family Affairs Christmas bonus payment is excluded when calculating the reckonable income limit for the special rate of maintenance grant.  While a limited number of grant awarding authorities may have, in error, included the Christmas bonus payment as reckonable income, my Department recently issued a letter to awarding authorities indicating that reckonable income should be net of the Christmas bonus payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">The annual income threshold for the special rate of maintenance grant is increased in line with the relevant social welfare payments.  Students eligible for the full non-adjacent rate of grant receive a standard rate grant of €3,420 and a €3,270 top-up amount, giving a total special rate of grant of €6,690.  Applicants with reckonable income above the threshold for the special rate may still qualify for the standard rate of maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">The student maintenance grant schemes also contain a change in circumstances clause whereby the eligibility of a person may be assessed or re-assessed by the grant awarding body in the event of changes in circumstances which are likely to be permanent, relating, <i>inter alia</i>, to the candidate’s reckonable income.  In addition to the maintenance grant schemes, other supports are available for students who may be marginally over the income limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The student assistance fund is designed to assist students who, having commenced a third level course, experience financial hardship that may render them unable to continue their studies.  In addition, the millennium partnership fund which has been in operation since 2000 provides support to students from disadvantaged areas with a view to improving participation and retention in further or higher education.  These funds are administered on behalf of my Department by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education in the Higher Education Authority and are funded by the Government under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">My Department is currently working with the National Access Office and Pobal in regard to the re-orientation of the millennium partnership fund to support the development of a whole-community approach to equity of access to higher education.  In this regard, a consultation process with community partnerships and other stakeholders is currently under way.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_462" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1339">The primary function of the redress board is to provide financial redress to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories or other institutions subject to State regulation or inspection.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 15 December 2005 by which time the board had received 14,513 applications.  The board has received a total of 14,549 applications (including 36 late applications accepted up to 31 December 2007).</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">Up to 3 November 2008, 12,280 applications were processed by the board.  The overall average award from the inception of the scheme is €64,892.  Awards are determined by the board having regard to the severity of the abuse, the severity of physical and psychological injury and the loss of opportunity resulting from the abuse.  The level of awards range in value from €0 to €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">Expenditure associated with the redress board to end 2007 was €745,591,963.  Based on the total number of applications received, the final cost of the scheme may be in the region of €1.1 billion, including legal and administration costs.  Any estimate of the final cost of the scheme at this point will be tentative as the board has more than 2,000 applications to process and the level of award provided in these remaining cases may vary substantially.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">The final cost of the redress scheme must be viewed in the context of the Government's acceptance of its responsibilities in apologising to victims of abuse and the very substantial costs that would have been incurred had no such scheme been established, with cases processed in the normal manner through the courts.  The scheme enables victims to obtain compensation for their injuries without having to face the trauma of pursuing their cases in court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">The Government in establishing the scheme considered it was the just and humane thing to do as the State was responsible for children that were placed in institutions by the courts and other public bodies.  With more than 2,000 cases yet to be processed, it is difficult to say at this point when the board will complete its work.  However, from experience, as a board generally clears between 200 to 220 cases per month, and is likely to have completed processing claims towards the end of 2009.  While the processing of awards should be completed in 2009, there will be some residual work to be completed by the board in 2010.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_463">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1344">The Minister has informed the House that there are 2,000 cases pending.  This figure does not take into account the potential impact of the Supreme Court decision in respect of the O'Neill judgment in the High Court last month.  If the High Court judgment stands — I do not wish to speculate on the outcome in this regard — the cost involved will be substantially higher because a cohort people previously unable to claim, those between 18 and 21 years at the time the abuse occurred — will be able to claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">If that happens the current total of €1.1 billion, for which the State will have to pick up the tab, will escalate further.  In this context, will the Minister consider reopening the outrageous deal entered into by this State in 2002 with the religious orders whereby effectively they are handing the State €128 million, a substantial amount of which has yet to be paid, despite the fact that the total cost of the scheme is in excess of €1 billion?  I put it to the Minister that if we lose in the Supreme Court, he should consider reopening the indemnity deal which his party put in place in 2002.</p>

            <p eId="para_1348">We have appealed it.  The appeal has been lodged.  We did so on the basis that we are confident, on foot of the Attorney General's advice, we have an excellent case and we are not satisfied with the result of the court decision.  As in other cases, the appropriate course is to allow the appeals process to continue.  We will continue to process the 2,000 applications as part of the scheme and as soon as the appeal judgment is issued, we will then review any consequences — if there are any —  on foot of that in regard to other matters that might apply.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_1349">I have two comments and two questions.  The Minister complained earlier about the high volume of questions his Department is obliged to answer.  If he examined the reply he just offered, he would note he was asked two questions to which he provided approximately 15 answers.  That is his own fault in this case.  He should parse and analyse the reply that was written for him.  He was asked about how much the scheme will cost and when the board will complete its work.  In answering it he made a mountain out of a molehill.  We could get through far more questions if he answered the question he was specifically asked.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_1355">That is the Department policy.  My point relates to the scale of the deal.  Will the Minister agree that the Department of Finance recommended to his predecessor, Deputy Woods, that the religious orders should, in principle, bear approximately half of the cost of the restitution?  That information is in the public domain.  What is now emerging is that they will bear less than 20% of the real cost, if it is €1.1 billion, and, as the Minister rightly said, we cannot sign off on that figure.  Irrespective of what the Supreme Court judgment may be, is it not time to revisit the whole compensation deal in the light of the unprecedented scale of the cost of the scheme, which we failed to anticipate at the time?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1356">There are two aspects to this.  One is that we have to await the outcome of decision on the appeal.  The second aspect is that a definitive contract and deal was done between the church and State.  As far as I am concerned, legally, that is the binding agreement that has been made.  From reading the newspapers, I understand that is an indication from the church that it would not be prepared to revisit this issue.  I have no detailed knowledge of the background to the agreement; I am dealing with its actuality and am quite satisfied the church is complying very much with that it and that great progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">There has been a transfer of property to the value of €66 million, a cash contribution of €52 million instead of €41.14 million and counselling as part of the service to the value of €10,000 has been provided.  The church has met by and large with all the requirements.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_484">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_1369">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Finance to establish a mortgage rescue scheme to minimise the number of mortgage repossessions, which is a potentially major cause of homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">The current economic climate and the persistent increases in mortgage possession action have made this an area that needs to be urgently addressed.  Financial deregulation and increased sub-prime lending has drawn in more economically vulnerable households, leading to a situation in which, according to Mr. Justice McGovern, mortgage lenders are leaving it to the courts to deal with the social wreckage caused by giving loans to people who cannot afford to repay them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">Many sub-prime lenders have encouraged people to borrow beyond their means and are quick to take action to repossess properties when payment default becomes an issue.  Insurance provisions cannot always save people from repossession and such repossession leads to homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">Mortgage rescue schemes — the introduction of such a scheme is what I am seeking  — are already in operation in other parts of Europe.  These can be in the form of shared ownership, which reduces the amount of mortgage repayments or a complete purchase of a property in which the former owner becomes the assured tenant and is able to remain in his or her home for as long as he or she likes.  There is also a number of private companies offering sale lease-back possibilities, but these may involve home owners selling a property for considerably less than its value and offer little in the way of tenure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">I want the Government to introduce proposals to reduce the number of households becoming homeless as a result of mortgage repossessions, which are currently running at a high level.  Education must be provided to ensure that people have the necessary financial capabilities to manage their affairs and information must be provided on what services are currently in place to support people with mortgage difficulties.  The Government must ensure that comprehensive information and advice is available to all consumers pre-purchase, taking into account affordability and, in particular, the implications of changes in circumstances and also encouraging improved communication between lenders and borrowers where difficulties arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Rural homelessness is not an issue that is commonly discussed and is often hidden as people may face stigma in their community if they lose their home. Dwellings are often in remote areas which are removed from services and such households have a greater difficulty in accessing these than those in urban areas. Housing options may be fewer and affordability for home ownership is particularly difficult, as house prices can be disproportionate to incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The threat of homelessness is very real and is rapidly increasing, with a 70% increase in the number of people seeking help to pay their mortgages from the start of this year and some 7,000 people now applying for assistance, a major increase compared to the 4,000 who were applying for it last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">The urgent development of a mortgage rescue scheme, allied with improvements in regulation and enforcement, to ensure that courts only approve possession action when lenders have explored all other options to prevent possession being taken, must be undertaken by the Government.  As Mr. Justice McGovern said recently: "I wonder what is realistically being done by banks and mortgage companies...?"  We could certainly add the Government to that question.  I welcome a favourable response from the Minister on the issue raised because it is one that is becoming increasingly widespread.  We need a scheme to be put in place urgently to protect people from homelessness.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_1377">Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a rá gur oth liom nach bhfuil an tAire Airgeadais, an Teachta Brian Lenihan, i láthair.  D'iarr sé orm an freagra seo a thabhairt don Teachta Bannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">I wish to start by addressing the Deputy's concerns on the need for supports for those who may fall into arrears on their mortgages and I will later address the issue of how mortgage providers deal with such situations when they arise and the role played by the Government and the Financial Regulator in responding to those difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">It is obviously most desirable that as few people as possible fall into arrears with their mortgages and one of the ways of achieving that is to ensure mortgages are affordable in the first instance.  In terms of the housing market, affordability in Ireland is currently supported by such factors as interest rates that remain low in historic terms — with today's ECB announcement providing further relief — and increases in mortgage interest relief available in particular to first-time buyers.  Successive budgets since 2006 have increased the level of mortgage interest relief available to first-time buyers in order to refocus mortgage interest relief towards home owners who are in most need of assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">In order to alleviate the difficulty for prospective first-time buyers who previously may have had access to a mortgage from mainstream financial institutions, but who are now unable to secure sufficient loan finance, the Government has decided to provide assistance through the new home choice loan.  Those loans are to be provided by local authorities to first-time buyers of new properties subject to a maximum loan of €285,000, and a maximum loan to value ratio of 92%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">Furthermore, it is envisaged that a new single streamlined Government equity product will be introduced in mid-2009 to change the way in which affordable housing is provided, to introduce greater equality into the system and to provide a basis for achieving greater consistency across the schemes and across different areas of the country.  The Government will take an equity stake in the affordable units sold, which the purchaser can either buy out in steps or at the end of a fixed period.  That means the State's investment will be better protected and should enable more funds to be recycled into affordable housing in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">The Minister for Finance has consistently highlighted the need for responsible behaviour by both borrowers and lenders and, in particular, the need to factor in to their financial decision-making the effects of potential future changes in economic and financial conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">Unfortunately, a number of borrowers develop debt problems.  Anyone experiencing difficulty in repaying a mortgage or other loan should discuss the matter with the loan provider and seek appropriate financial advice without delay.  The money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.  Funding for MABS in 2008 is almost €18 million and is to continue at that level for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">The Department of Social and Family Affairs also funds the demand-led mortgage interest supplement scheme, which provides short-term income support to those eligible who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  Support for the scheme was re-affirmed in the recent budget and payments from it have reached more than €20 million so far this year.  As it is a demand-led scheme, the Government is committed to meeting all payments arising under it, thereby affording protection to those who need it when they need it most.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">The Deputy will appreciate that recent media attention on court proceedings for home repossessions needs to be interpreted with caution, given the variety of circumstances that give rise to such cases.  Although the number of cases involving applications for repossession orders is up in each of the past two years, it should be noted that orders are not always granted and do not always represent residential mortgages.  Even when orders are granted, they are not always followed through and levels remain low compared to historical averages and in comparison to similar jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">Non-financial supports in place include the Financial Regulator's consumer protection code, CPC, which applies to home loan providers operating in the State, including so-called sub-prime lenders.  The CPC requires mortgage lenders to undertake suitability assessments before offering a product or service to consumers as well as requiring the regulated provider to contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears, irrespective of the amount of the arrears.  The CPC also specifies that the regulated provider must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears and the Financial Regulator's CEO has pointed out that the Financial Regulator considers this to include a requirement that lenders agree a remedial action plan with a borrower as soon as they detect arrears starting to emerge and to try to assist the borrower to manage his or her financial commitments and not allow the situation to worsen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The Deputy may wish to note that the provisions of the scheme made under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, requires institutions covered by the guarantee in Ireland to confirm their compliance not only with the consumer protection code, but also with the Irish Banking Federation's, IBF, code of practice on mortgage arrears, IBF code.  The other IBF and Irish Mortgage Council members comply with the IBF code on a voluntary basis.  In accordance with the IBF code, borrowers are advised to contact their lender about any problems they may experience in meeting their repayments schedule.  It recommends that the borrower contact the lender after one missed scheduled payment, again irrespective of the amount, in order to prevent a situation of mounting arrears arising with negative consequences for both the borrower and lender.  Once the borrower has contacted the lender, the latter will consider all viable options and develop a plan for clearing the mortgage arrears.  Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">In the light of the above, I am satisfied that adequate safeguards are currently in place to minimise home repossessions in Ireland.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation carefully and will consider the requirement for any further responses in order that the legitimate interests of mortgage holders are safeguarded.</p>

          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_486">
            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_1389">Having listened to the previous reply, this one will add further grist to the Minister's mill.  The case I wish to outline turns the response we have heard completely on its head.  In this case one of the partners is out of the family home due to circumstances beyond the other person's control.  Mortgage arrears have arisen to the extent of approximately €6,000.  The monthly mortgage payment is approximately €1,400, depending on the interest rate.  The person's total income is in the region of €1,500 per month and the mortgage is 95% of that.  How does one expect a family to survive with two children in those circumstances?</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I advised the person to apply for family income supplement, FIS, as she had applied for the one-parent family allowance previously.  She was granted FIS.  A helpful letter around that time from the superintendent community welfare officer said: "It would be advisable for Ms So and So to speak with her partner with a view to his surrendering his interest in the family home, in which case the Department would be able to assist fully with the interest element of the mortgage repayment."  It transpires that if the husband's interest in the family home was surrendered that would solve the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">What amused me most is that it will take time to do that.  One does not know what will be the eventual outcome of the family home circumstances.  To go through the court proceedings and all entailed in that will incur further expenses both on the part of the State and on the poor unfortunate person.  The sad part is that having been awarded FIS, the woman received a letter from the community welfare officer saying the combination of FIS and the €27 per week she earns from employment, which has been taken into account in a means test, means she no longer qualifies for any assistance with her mortgage.  I do not think community welfare officers are fully aware of the rules and regulations in the application of the system.  It is happening all the time and the Minister of State knows this well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">I totally disagree with the Minister of State's statement on new sub-prime mortgages.  They are still sub-prime mortgages because all that will happen is that over-priced houses will be off-loaded to unfortunate people who are totally incapable of paying for them and who will have negative equity in the next six months, let alone two years.  I say this having dealt with housing loans for years.  I deal with a large volume every year and I am sure every other Member does the same.  It is only by doing so that one gains experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">In heaven's name, will somebody evaluate this case according to the person's income and recognise that she has approximately €150 per month on which to live after paying the mortgage and that there are recurring household expenses over which she has no control?  Making a decision on entitlements on the basis of looking at a chart is not desirable.  The Minster of State should remember that community welfare officers can exercise discretion.  They operate according to guidelines, not rigid statutory rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">Will the Minister of State send some kind of message, by pigeon or some other method, down the line to staff who deal with these cases to explain that these are very difficult times and that people need to be treated with respect and concern, given that they may face increases in mortgage arrears and ultimately may be on the roadside without a house?  The local authority or HSE will have full responsibility.  These bodies can walk away from the matter and say they have no responsibility but if they walk away, we had better recognise that we are flying in the face of all the precedents and established practices of the past 40 years.  For God's sake, will the Minister of State tell somebody to wake up and deal with these circumstances immediately and not wait for six months or a year?</p>

            <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_1395">Is olc liom a rá nach bhfuil mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh, an Teachta Mary Hanafin, i láthair.  Táim cinnte go mbeidh sí ag léamh an Tuairisc Oifigiúil.  I thank Deputy Durkan for raising a clear example of a difficulty of which I know the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, will be very much aware.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house that is their sole place of residence.  The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">In general, a person may be entitled to a mortgage interest supplement provided she or he is habitually resident in the State; the loan agreement was entered into at a time when, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, the person was in a position to meet the repayments; the residence in respect of which the loan is payable is not offered for sale; the mortgage interest payable does not exceed such amount as the Health Service Executive considers reasonable to meet his or her residential needs — in exceptional circumstances, a supplement may be awarded where the mortgage interest exceeds such amount as the executive considers reasonable, but such a supplement is payable for a maximum of 12 months only; and she or he satisfies a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The minimum contribution will be increased to €18 per week from January 2009.  Many recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">Where two people enter into a joint mortgage agreement there is an obligation on both parties to meet repayments as agreed with the financial institution.  The fact that one of the joint mortgage holders is not resident in the property does not remove the obligation on that person to meet that part of the loan repayment which is reasonably attributable to him or her.  It is not considered appropriate that the Exchequer should provide assistance towards the accumulation of a capital asset on the part of the absent party to a mortgage agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">Where a person residing in the property becomes the sole mortgage holder, a mortgage interest supplement can be considered in respect of such amount as a community welfare officer considers reasonable to meet the person's accommodation needs up to the full amount of interest payable.  Where the person resident in the property continues as a joint mortgage holder, a mortgage interest supplement payment will be considered in respect of half of the interest on the mortgage.  However, the community welfare officer will take into account the circumstances of each case and in particular where a person resident in a property is seeking to become the sole mortgage holder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">It is a matter for the community welfare officer to a make a decision on entitlement to mortgage interest supplement and the amount of that supplement, based on all of the facts of the case and the relevant legislative provisions.  There is a right of appeal against the decision of a community welfare officer to a Health Service Executive appeals officer and thereafter to the chief appeals officer of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">The Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned is not entitled to mortgage interest supplement as her combined income from employment, the one-parent family payment and family income supplement is sufficient to meet the total mortgage interest due on the loan.</p>

          <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_492">
            <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_1407">I wish to draw attention to the need for permanent accommodation for Scoil na Camóige in Clondalkin.  The school was not included in the list of school buildings announced recently by the Minister for Education and Science.  This is very surprising and disappointing for the school, its board of management, the parents and the children.  The school has been in temporary accommodation for 15 years and, for most of this time, it has been in prefabricated buildings that are approximately 20 years old.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">The school must be one of the schools waiting longest for permanent accommodation.  I have raised in the past the fact that Gaelscoileanna seem to be faring very badly in this regard.  Many of the schools awaiting permanent accommodation for a long time seem to be Gaelscoileanna.   Fifteen years is an extremely long period, particularly given that the school in question is in very unsatisfactory accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">Let me outline the history of the school's request for permanent accommodation.  Great hope was given to the school, the parents and children in the lead-up to the general election in 2007 in that they were led to believe a permanent school building would be provided.  The issue of the site for the building appeared to have been resolved.  Government Deputies, including the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy John Curran, were very quick to give good news to parents in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">I have a copy of a leaflet issued in this period by the Minister for Health and Children.  It stated she was delighted with the progress made up to that point on what was an important issue for Clondalkin.  It also stated she hoped any outstanding details could be resolved very quickly.  She paid tribute to all who would be involved in making this happen, especially the parents, who were described as being so energetic and committed in their campaign for the new school site.  The Minister thanked them for their kind words regarding the help she had given them and stated she was only too delighted to have pulled out all the stops to make that happen.  However, nothing has happened since and the school is in exactly the same position as it was during the general election campaign in 2007.  It is still in the same prefabs and the improvements made to those were done out of money raised by parents and the school board of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Recent correspondence from the Department of Education and Science does not offer much hope to the school.  A letter to the council which had raised the issue with the Department states that the school building would be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  Nothing is stated about when the school will be built.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">In 2007, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said that everybody agreed that the current prefab school was not suitable for the pupils or staff and that a new school building was required.  At the time serious concerns were expressed about  health and safety concerns with regard to the prefabs.  There were problems with heating and a student had fainted in the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">Recently, the principal requested the council to carry out a dampness report on the school.  Serious dampness problems were found.  There was poor ventilation in the girls' toilets, damp in the boys' toilets and a firedoor needed a draught excluder fitted.  The corridor was recorded on the upper register of the damp meter.  There was mould in the staff room and in the toilets and there was high damp registration in many of the classrooms.  Mould was found on the building.  This could cause problems for the pupils because mould has been found to be a factor for people who have asthma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">In general, prefab buildings are not very energy efficient, getting over-heated in summer and taking too long to heat in the winter.  Considerable costs are involved in heating prefabs.  If any school should be given priority in the school building programme, Gaelscoil na Camóige is that school.  I wish the Minister of State to update me on this matter.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1415">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the Department's plans to provide for the infrastructural needs of the three all-Irish schools in Clondalkin, including Gaelscoil na Camóige.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">The three schools are Gaelscoil na Camóige and Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin which are primary schools, and Coláiste Chillian, a post-primary school.  Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin and Coláiste Chillian currently occupy the same VEC-owned site in Clondalkin.  Gaelscoil na Camóige occupies rented accommodation in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The Department is committed to providing permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil na Camóige and, with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, it made strenuous attempts to acquire a suitable site to enable this.  None was available.  The Department then sought the assistance of the County of Dublin VEC to arrive at a solution.  An earlier VEC proposal was rejected by the school authority but a second proposal was accepted.  This involves the provision of permanent accommodation for the school on the Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin-Coláiste Chillian site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">Gaelscoil na Camóige has a current enrolment of 225 pupils.  Its staffing comprises a principal and eight classroom assistants.  The school also has two special education teachers.  Gaelscoil Chluain Dolcáin currently has 279 pupils on roll and has a staffing complement of a principal and ten classroom assistants.  Three special education teachers are employed there.  The intention is to provide each school with permanent accommodation for 16 mainstream classroom assistants to cater for the long-term needs of the area.  It is also intended that the schools will re-organise to form a junior and a senior school.  The current enrolment for Coláiste Chillian is 387 pupils.  Its accommodation is being increase to provide for 680 pupils to cater for demand from the expansion of the primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">The Department asked the VEC to carry out a master plan of the site to ascertain if it could facilitate the plans to accommodate all three schools.  This has been done and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the site can be developed as intended.  The next step is the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">As the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has explained in this House on a number of occasions, all applications for large-scale capital funding, including the one in question, are assessed against published prioritisation criteria and assigned a band rating.  Projects are selected for inclusion in a capital programme consistent with that band rating.  The band rating attaching to this project is band 1.4, a high rating, and reflects the fact that all-Irish infrastructural provision in the area is to be rationalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">However, due to the scale of the demand on the capital budget of the Department of Education and Science, it is not possible to provide an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  Recently the Minister explained the situation in this regard to a delegation from the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">The Minister is aware there are issues with regard to the school's temporary accommodation.  The Department of Education and Science has informed the board of management that it has the responsibility to ensure that the accommodation it is renting is suitable for school use.  It should raise matters of concern directly with the landlord and ensure they are addressed to its satisfaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter and I assure her that I acknowledge the need for permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil na Camóige.  I am committed to providing this as soon as the necessary funding is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1427">The Universities Act, 1997, confers autonomous statutory responsibilities on  universities in relation to the day to day management of their affairs. It is a  matter for each university to manage their financial resources and to take the  necessary steps to ensure that expenditure is kept within the approved budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">There have been substantial improvements in the funding of higher education in  recent years. Overall provision to the third level sector (including capital,  recurrent funding and student grants) amounted to some €1.5 billion in 2004,  some €1.9 billion in 2007 and some €2 billion in 2008. This is an increase of  over 33% since 2004 and an increase of over 111% since 1998 levels when funding to the sector was some €949m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">Recurrent funding allocated specifically to the University sector has increased  in recent years from €631 million in 2004 to some €790 million in 2007 and to  some €831 million in 2008. This represents an increase of some 32% since 2004  and an increase of some 118% since 1998 levels. This excludes separately  provided programmes of funding for capital, for research and development and  from the Strategic Innovation Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">I have been advised by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) that of the five  universities referred to by the Deputy, Trinity College Dublin do not expect to  have a budget deficit for the purposes of their 2008 accounts. The expected  budget deficits on the 2008 accounts in the case of the other universities  referred to by the Deputy are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">University College Dublin (UCD): €15m;</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">University College Cork (UCC): €3m;</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">The National University of Ireland, Maynooth (NUIM): €3.9m;</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">University of Limerick (UL): €1.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">These deficits will be a first charge on the allocations to each of these  universities in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">In relation to reductions in funding for 2008, a Government decision of July  2008 identified the need for savings of some €6.6 million to be achieved on the  Education Vote in 2008.   A savings target of €4.467m collectively was  identified for the university and institute of technology sectors and the other  HEA designated institutions. In this context, in addition to overall reductions  on particular programmes of funding to the sector, specific reductions to  notified recurrent funding allocations were applied directly to the five  universities referred to by the Deputy as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">UCD: €241,618;</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">UCC: €158,472;</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">TCD: €176,499;</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">NUIM: €60,054;</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">UL: €83,974.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">There is a responsibility on each of the universities to identify and take  whatever measures are required to manage within the budgets available to them.   The facility to carry deficits allows a degree of flexibility across calendar  years to reflect the fact that the management of budgets in individual  universities operates on an academic year basis.  However, any significant  carry-over of deficits into 2009 will present challenges for university  management given the tight constraints on overall funding in 2009 and the need  for the universities to achieve pay-roll and non pay savings in common with all  public sector organisations.  I understand from the Higher Education Authority  that it is in continuing correspondence with the universities in relation to  deficits and is meeting with each university to discuss their budgetary  situation. The Irish Universities Association (IUA) has been advised that the  Authority will be paying particular attention to the level of deficit in the  sector and will be requiring specific plans on how institutions propose to  address any deficits. Through the HEA, I will be monitoring the level of  deficit in the sector on an on-going basis throughout 2009.</p>

         the reason his Department claims to compile statistics on primary schools on a county basis, as in Parliamentary Question No. 173 of 20 November 2008, yet cannot compile statistics on the number of prefabs each school has; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1444">The types of data collected in my Department's Annual Census of Primary schools  include information on pupils' age, standard and class, data on entrants,  leavers, learning support, pupil retention and teacher data. The Census also  collects information on pupils with special educational needs in special  classes and special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">When all school returns have been processed, a series of statistical tables is  produced giving information on indicators such as overall enrolment in primary  schools, average class size, teacher numbers and pupil teacher ratios. Schools  in my Department's database are coded fully by county and data are currently  published on a county by county basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">In designing the census to be completed by schools, it is necessary to strike a  balance between gathering a large amount of information and reducing the  administrative burden on schools by ensuring that the census is not  unnecessarily onerous or time-consuming to complete.  In this regard, my  Department focuses on key data which is known to change on an annual basis,  such as pupil numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">While it may be desirable to gather other data, this must be done in a cost  effective manner.  Similarly, the information gathered must be managed  effectively and my Department has been developing its information management  systems, within the context of the limited administrative and financial  resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">As part of the Data Strategy, my Department has committed to reducing the  administrative burden on schools where possible. To ask schools to supply data  regarding their school buildings on an annual basis would significantly  increase their existing administrative burden.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">While comprehensive information on temporary accommodation in schools is held on individual school files, my Department did not in the past have these  details available in a format that provided readily accessible cumulative  information on the overall position regarding temporary accommodation. However, this issue is being addressed and work on compiling a comprehensive database of such information will be completed shortly. This work is part of a general review of rental policy being undertaken. Information has already been  collected and is being collated on approximately 900 schools which had received  approval from the Department for temporary accommodation — including but not  limited to prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">The database of temporary accommodation that is currently being finalised will  inform my Department's future decision-making in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_496">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1452">Both the Education Act 1998 and the Education for Persons with Special Needs  2004 include a range of provisions to ensure that the educational needs of all  students including those with a disability are identified and provided for. In  this context, a range of accommodations are provided to enable students with  disabilities to access the Certificate examinations.  For example enlarged  print, Braille translation, modified questions, use of a scribe, a reader, a  personal assistant, a tape recorder or word processor, may be allowed depending on needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The scheme was expanded in 2000 following the report of an Expert Advisory  Group, to provide opportunities for exemptions where a candidate was not in a  position to demonstrate achievement in a specific area of assessment. In  keeping with the advice of the Expert Advisory Group and in line with practice  at that time in other jurisdictions, a system of annotation was applied to any  case where a student was exempt from a specific  area of assessment, or where  the mode of assessment used had the same effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">Spelling and grammar waivers in language subjects were provided for students  suffering from dyslexia and other learning disabilities on a similar basis with  effect from 2001, with annotation of the certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">The practice of annotation was the subject of a ruling of the Equality Tribunal  in November 2006. The Department appealed the ruling in the Circuit Court, and  the Court ruled on 19 October 2007 that the annotation had not discriminated  against the students concerned. This ruling is being appealed to the High  Court.  The State Examinations Commission was asked to undertake a review of  policy and practice in this area taking account of best international practice  and in March 2007 announced the establishment of an advisory group for this  purpose. I understand the report of the Advisory Group has now been finalised  and submitted to the State Examinations Commission. The Commissioners are due to meet early in the new year to consider the Report, and will forward it to me  after that with their advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">I have no plans for change in this area, pending full examination of the  Advisory Group's report and consideration of the views of the State  Examinations Commission and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The current curricula in languages make it clear that spelling and grammar are  essential elements of language subjects and are assessed as part of the  examinations. The marks awarded to this area are not disproportionate. For  example, in English in the Leaving Certificate, some 10% of the overall marks  are applied to this area under the heading of "accuracy of mechanics".</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">In regard to literacy generally, it should be noted that the OECD PISA study  (Programme for International Student Assessment) of 15 years olds in 56  countries undertaken in 2006 showed that Ireland ranked 6th in Reading overall  and 5th out of 29 OECD countries.  Only one EU country, Finland, achieved a  higher mean score than Ireland in reading.</p>

            <p eId="para_1460">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other  areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at  school level were included in the Budget day announcements including the  projected net impact on teacher numbers in primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Clearly a net reduction in the number of teachers, while relatively small in  terms of the overall number of teachers that will continue to be employed in  our schools, will of course impact to some degree on the pupil teacher ratio in  a situation where enrolments are rising. This applies to the ratio for the  country as a whole in the primary and post-primary sectors and will apply at  individual county level also. There may be some differences between counties  depending on the distribution of the projected increase in enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for  this House or for the public generally what the final impact will be on the  overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school  year and this applies to final pupil teacher ratios as well. I have nothing to  hide here. I have been upfront with the Irish people in relation to these  measures and I am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the  staffing position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school  and there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same. I  have however taken issue with some of the extreme claims that are being made  about the overall impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been  completed. The allocation processes including notification to schools will  commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a  function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the  retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available  within the agreed terms of the scheme. The appellate process is particularly  relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the  school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective  system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools  retain teachers, though over quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the  allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools early in  the new year and I do not propose to divert staff to engage in producing  estimated or hypothetical outcomes for individual counties.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1467">The Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation constitutes one of the principal pillars of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, and is underpinned by a projected total investment of €8.2 billion. It is an  integrated whole of Government approach to the realisation of an agreed vision  that, by 2013, Ireland will be internationally renowned for the excellence of  its research and at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for  economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">The €8.2 billion allocation within the SSTI provides for separate programmes of  support across a number of Government departments. This investment aims to  improve the scale and quality of research carried out in Ireland. The  allocation is disaggregated on the basis of research funding activities on a  sectoral basis, each of which will be contributing to varying degrees to the  funding of expanded PhD outputs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Doubling the number of PhD graduates by 2013 is just one of the goals of this  investment. Increasing the number of research teams within our higher education  system, enhanced collaboration with industry and increased investment by  enterprise in R &amp; D activities are also essential for the development of a  world class research system. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for  Enterprise, Trade and Employment has lead responsibility for the whole of  Government approach to implementation of the Strategy for Science, Technology  and Innovation. The range of relevant activities under various Ministers is  also overseen by a Cabinet Committee on Science, Technology and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The SSTI target to double the output of PhDs by 2013 is advancing  significantly. The most recent data show total PhD numbers rising to over 1000  in 2007, increasing from 808 in 2005. This indicates that we are on track for  achieving our goal of producing in excess of 1,300 PhD graduates annually by  2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The achievement of the overall target of PhD numbers will rely on inputs and  funding contributions of a range of cross-sectoral research funders. The full  aggregate cost contribution across each of the agencies involved is not  available. However it is anticipated that full implementation of planned SSTI  investments across Government will enable the target to be met. My Department  is directly contributing to the achievement of this target through its funding  of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, the Irish Research  Council for Science Engineering and Technology and the Irish Research Council  for Humanities and Social Sciences, all of which provide funding for PhD  students. Cycle 4 of the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions  will fund some 300 PhD students over its lifespan and over 1000 students are  undertaking a PhD in 2008 with funding support from the two research councils.</p>

         the percentage of children in respect of primary school sizes in primary schools of 30 pupils or more for the years 1987 to 2009; the percentage of children in primary classes of less than 20 pupils for the years 1987 to 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_499">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1473">I am making a table available on class size data for the school years 1987/88 to 2007/08. This shows the improvements over the twenty year period with the percentage of pupils in classes of less than 20 pupils increasing from 3.3% to 13.8%.  It also shows how the percentage of pupils in classes of 30 pupils or more has fallen from almost 68% to just over 20%. The information for the current school year will not be available until all the enrolment returns from schools are fully processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">The improvements over the years reflect our commitment to education and the  increased investment when the country was better able to afford it.  We reduced  the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from an average of  35 primary pupils per teacher in 1995/96 down to the current level of 27  pupils. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September  2009 has to be viewed in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Although it reverses some of the progress that we have made in recent years I  had no option but to curtail the annual increase in teacher numbers. While I  appreciate this will impact on class sizes the reality is that it will not  impact on every school rather the change will impact on the total number of  teachers in some 10 to 15% of primary schools. The reduced class sizes for the  most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20  pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in  Senior classes will not be changing in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">In any discussion of class size and classes where the number of pupils exceed  the average it is important to understand how the main staffing schedule sets  out to treat schools in like circumstances in a fair and consistent manner. The  current allocation is based on an average of 27 pupils per teacher and schools  make individual choices in assigning teachers to class groups. With over 20,000  individual classes spread across all schools throughout the country there will  always be differences in individual class sizes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">It is of course the case that some schools can have class sizes of greater than  27 but this is often because of a local decision by a school to use its  teaching resources in order to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed,  very often when a particular school has a class of over thirty in a particular  grade, it is because there is another class in the same school with just 20  pupils or so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in  the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and  prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers  are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that  teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything  else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality  teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it  represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1546">The Leaving Certificate Biology syllabus aims to ensure that students attain certain skills which include an ability to carry out practical work, laboratory work and fieldwork activities safely and effectively. According to the revised syllabus,  students must study and visit one ecosystem. This fieldwork is essential for the effective teaching and learning in this topic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">The arrangements for the fieldwork can take a variety of forms and can range  from day trips to local centres where they are facilitated by tutors to  fieldwork undertaken in local parks and within school grounds.  I understand  that visits which have proved extremely effective have included trips to  football pitches, hedgerows, nearby parks and rocky seashores. Leaving  Certificate Biology students have weekly double lessons for practical work.   Where fieldwork trips are based on the school site, they may be incorporated  into a double class period which eliminates the need for substitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">There has been extensive, nationwide in-service training for Biology teachers  in the area of ecology fieldwork techniques, delivered by the Biology Support  Service. Teachers should be in a position to be able to deliver this element of  the curriculum effectively to students in a variety of locations.  In addition,  there is on-going support should any teacher feel that they require further  support in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of  public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to  ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect my Department, while  protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure,  could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding  restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these  are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need  to manage Exchequer resources prudently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">It is a matter for each school management authority to organise its classes,  curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils'  needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">I have no plans to drop the fieldwork component of this subject.  It should be  noted that my Department continues to pay substantial allowances to teachers  for provision of supervision and substitute cover.</p>

            <p eId="para_1554">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 25 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">While I have not met with managers of the Protestant fee charging schools I did  meet with representatives of the Church of Ireland Board of Education, led by  Archbishop John Neill, on 13 November last.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">The meeting provided me with an opportunity to explain at first hand the  context for the budget changes that were of concern to the Bishops and the  schools serving the Church of Ireland and other minority churches. In the  course of the meeting, I confirmed my budget day announcement that the funding provided through the Protestant Block grant was being continued by the  Government. I explained that against a backdrop of a difficult economic and  fiscal situation I had to take decisions that impacted on the staffing and the  range of funding grants to schools generally. The decision to cease paying  certain grants to the Protestant fee charging schools, that were not paid to  other fee charging schools, has to be viewed in that wider context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">It was inevitable in the difficult financial circumstances that the education  budget for 2009 could not be totally spared from the need to curtail  expenditure but it is important to reiterate again that the Protestant Block  Grant which in the current school year amounts to €6.25 million will continue  to be available and the retention of this grant demonstrates the importance  that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of  the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational  ethos. Historically this payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants  and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the Churches concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">I fully appreciate the concerns that were expressed to me about the needs of  the dispersed minority population and the particular need to sustain schools in  the Protestant tradition that are directly serving that dispersed population in  particular areas of the country. In that regard I expressed my willingness at  the meeting to respond positively to any proposals that might be made to my  Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted  to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and  sustaining the dispersed schools that they wish to attend. The Bishops  indicated that they would reflect on how the funding I am continuing to make  available might best be deployed to meet the needs of their schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Further meetings can be scheduled at any point to develop and build on what I  believe was a useful and constructive discussion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1561">Section 52 of the Universities Act, 1997, prohibits the use of the term ‘University' where the organisation is engaged in the provision of education services unless the Minister for Education and Science consents to the use of the term. When my Department has become aware of organisations using the term without consent, appropriate action has been taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">In most cases, when the legislative requirements were explained, the  organisations concerned voluntarily agreed to stop using the title. Agreement  has also been reached with the Companies Registration Office that any business  name applied for which features the term ‘University' will not be accepted  without the express approval of the Department of Education and Science. In  addition, the Irish Domain Registry has agreed not to register web addresses  using the title ‘University'.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">In addition, the Department maintains an Internationalisation Register  containing programmes which are approved for the purpose of access to work by  students who are citizens from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland.

            <p eId="para_1566">The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the cost of postage of notices to Boards of Management is not readily available within my Department. The amount spent by my Department on the distribution of publications to schools etc. cannot be separated from the overall cost of postage issued from my Department. My Department's total expenditure on postage  this year to end October is €2,031,176.79. This figure includes the cost of  posting a variety of materials to schools including publications, circulars,  paycheques, posters, leaflets, etc. It should also be noted that my Department  agrees on occasion to circulate relevant materials produced by other  organisations to schools, the postage costs given above do not exclusively  relate to material emanating from the Department. My Department regularly  reviews its postage arrangements with a view to achieving maximum value for  money. In this regard, last year my Department introduced a system of regular  bulk mailings to schools in order to avail of discounted rates and to minimise  postal costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">A wide range of publications and reports are made available electronically on  my Department's website: www.education.ie.  It is the policy of my Department  that all circulars can be accessed on my Department's website and all circulars  and notices of general application, whether issued via the postal service or  not, are posted on the website for reference and download.  The circular or  notice in question, where appropriate, requests the management authority to  bring its contents to the attention of staff and /or parents in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">Teachers are generally made aware of the existence of circulars relating to pay  by the inclusion of a text facility in their payslip. In addition, the Online  Claims System (OLCS) which has been rolled out to primary and post primary  schools has also removed the need for schools to submit certain information to  my Department on paper forms, thus saving on printing and postage costs for  both schools and my Department.  In certain instances schools are also notified  when a Circular has been placed on the website by the inclusion of a paragraph  on the notes of the OLCS system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">In a further effort to reduce the costs of printing and distribution of  publications in 2009, it is now corporate policy within my Department that all  publications will be web based and will only be printed and distributed by post  in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Email is used by my Department's Post Primary Teachers Unit to disseminate  information relating to the posting of circulars on the website and other  information to the CEOs of the 33 VECs, the management bodies and the unions in addition to alerting schools through the OLCS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">An email service for the Schools Broadband Access Programme has been  commissioned and designed and has been piloted with a number of schools to test the system and obtain feedback on the service. The Department is considering the wider application of this email service generally for schools and  specifically as a communications tool for the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1574">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 44 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">It is a matter for the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to determine the format  of annual reports published by Institutes of Technology. The format of the  reports published by individual universities is determined by their respective  Governing authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">I believe the development of appropriate data collection and reporting systems  is critical to providing the information necessary for the management,  oversight and development of the higher education sector. While some  institutions report staff and student statistics in their annual reports by  academic department, as there is no consistent definition of what constitutes  an academic department across the higher education sector, comparison of this  data is not meaningful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">With a view to developing enhanced data collection and reporting systems, the  HEA has been consulting with partner agencies in order to define a common  format that meets all agencies' needs. This process is at an early stage, and  will require agreement across all interested agencies and higher education  institutions to succeed. It is envisaged that timely annual reporting of staff  numbers by discipline and activity will emerge from this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">My Department, through the Strategic Innovation Fund, is also funding a number of specific projects that will contribute to this process.  These include:</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1593">The Government agreed a transition period to full water charges in the case of  non-fee charging recognised schools and the Department of the Environment,  Heritage and Local Government has advised local authorities of the detailed  arrangements regarding the implementation of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">The transitional arrangements afford schools the opportunity to put in place  water conservation arrangements and practices and to undertake works that can  help reduce water usage significantly before full water charges are introduced.  By virtue of good water conservation schools can be in a much stronger position  to reduce the impact of water charges on their overall budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">Under the transition arrangements agreed by the Government, schools pay a flat rate per pupil fee as follows:- 2007- €3 per pupil, 2008 — €3.50 per pupil and  2009- €4 per pupil enrolled. For 2007, charges applied based on metering were  recalculated on the transitional flat rate with a credit given for any excess  payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">Guidance was also issued to schools on the most appropriate measures to  minimise excess consumption of water and to reduce wastage where it exists. In  addition, water conservation issues will continue to be addressed by my  Department as a matter of routine where new schools are being built or where  major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools  modernisation programme. Furthermore those schools with very high water  consumption will be identified and contacted with a view to introducing  measures to help them reduce water usage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">In the context of reducing water costs for schools, it has been demonstrated  that fitting simple water saving devices to toilets and sinks can reduce water  consumption considerably at very little cost, as can other small works such as  fixing easily identifiable leaks. Primary school authorities may use their  annual minor works grant to fund such measures. The minor works grant has  increased by nearly 50% over the past two years and some €27m is due to issue  to all primary schools in early 2009 under this grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">My Department remains in close liaison with the Department of Environment and Local Government regarding water conservation and is supportive of any  initiatives by it and local authorities that will help reduce water costs for  schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">In relation to day to day funding for schools I prioritised funding for primary  schools in the recent budget, increasing the standard rate of capitation grant  at primary level to €200 per pupil. The increases in the enhanced rates for  special needs pupils in special classes and special schools brings the top rate  up to almost €1,000 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">The capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%,  representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from  January 2009. Voluntary secondary schools will also benefit also from an  increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil from January  2009. This will mean, for example, that a secondary school with an enrolment of  500 pupils will receive an additional €11,000 in funding in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">While I clearly will want to improve funding as soon as circumstances permit, I  am anxious to make the capitation grant mechanism the single funding channel  for schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1604">As a result of the need to make savings in Budget 2009, this grant has been  abolished with effect from 1 January 2009. The budget required difficult  choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions  were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the  long run.  In this respect, the education sector, while protected to a much  greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be  totally spared.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">While certain grants are to be abolished, I would like to emphasise that the  capitation grant for post-primary schools has been increased by 4.3%,  representing an increase of €14 per pupil, to bring it to €345 per pupil from  January 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1614">The English language education sector is an important part of Ireland's  international education offering, and is a major contributor to the Irish  economy.  Recent estimates put its total impact on the economy at around €500  million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">It is important, therefore, that institutions offering English language courses  and other programmes of education to international students should operate in a  regulatory environment which is robust and appropriate, and which has  credibility both domestically and in the international market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The existing regulatory regime for English language schools is operated by  ACELS — the Advisory Council for English Language Schools — a body under the  aegis of my Department.  Institutions offering English language programmes must meet a set of standards in areas such as learning and teaching provision,  teacher qualifications, premises and facilities. Compliance with these  standards is assessed through an inspection regime operated by ACELS.  Only  programmes of education which meet these standards, and have been subject to  inspection can be added to my Department's internationalisation register, which  allows access by non-EEA students to employment, subject to certain  conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">Given the importance of the international education sector generally, my  Department will be examining the overall regulatory regime for international  education provision.

            <p eId="para_1635">It is my belief that a well planned Physical Education programme has a vitally important role to play in a broad and balanced curriculum for our primary and second level students.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">At primary level, Physical Education is one of seven curriculum areas within  the revised Primary School Curriculum which was introduced in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced Physical Education programme for pupils, and includes six broad strands featuring Athletics, Dance, Gymnastics, Games, Outdoor and adventure activities and Aquatics. A programme of inservice training in PE has been provided to support the full implementation of the curriculum.  In addition to  implementing the curriculum, schools are also encouraged to devote one day  every year to "Sport for All" whereby an entire day is given over to sporting  activities that emphasise participation and co-operation, rather than winning  or losing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1637">In accordance with the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools, all second level schools should provide Physical Education as part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on my Department's approved syllabuses and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The syllabuses have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1638">The phasing in of a revised Physical Education syllabus (non-examination) at  Junior Cycle level commenced in September 2003. The Junior Cycle Physical  Education Support Service has been in place since then to support teachers in  the implementation of this syllabus. The programme includes adventure  activities, aquatics, athletics, dance, invasion games, net and fielding games,  gymnastics and health related activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">Apart from the formal curricula, schools take a range of measures to encourage  physical activity among students during the school day and many provide  extensive, broad-based programmes of co-curricular physical activities that are  highly rewarding for both pupils and teachers alike. In particular, schools  play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in  sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the  Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, the Football Association of  Ireland provide extensive opportunities for such participation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1641">The Advisory Council for English Language Schools (ACELS) was established in  1967 and reconstituted as a company operating under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science in 1995. It provides a voluntary quality assurance and inspection scheme for private sector English language schools. ACELS also approves teacher training qualifications for the EFL private sector, and has developed English language proficiency test instruments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1648">that premises meet the requirements set out in a schedule of standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1649">There is an annual application process and all centres are inspected prior to  approval, as well as being subject to a full inspection at least once every  three years. Unannounced spot checks are also undertaken. The quality standards for management, staffing and administration are on the website, as are the criteria for inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">The programmes recognised by ACELS for teaching in the EFL sector are  programmes which comply with the Key Standards and Guidelines and Common  Assessment Framework for the Certificate in English Language Teaching, or the  Preparatory TEFL qualification for State qualified teachers. The key standards  and assessment framework, also on the website, cover such issues as trainee  entry criteria, course duration and programme hours, supervised teaching  practice, classroom observation, lesson planning and programmes of work,  teaching techniques and assessment, classroom management and selection of  materials, and review, in addition to having appropriate premises and resources  for the programme.  These standards are based on best international practice in  the EFL sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">Applications may be made to ACELS for approval of teacher training programmes for this purpose. In addition, ELT programmes of a minimum of 115 hours duration leading to awards recognised by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, Dublin Institute of Technology, NUI and recognised  universities, and their international equivalent are also recognised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1653">In general, there are no grants payable directly to teachers to obtain a postgraduate qualification. However, the Teacher Education Section does pay tuition fees directly to colleges  for teachers who undertake a number of post-graduate programmes in the area of Special Educational Needs. The Deputy  might be interested to note that teachers who successfully complete certain  post-graduate programmes in the area of Special Educational Needs also qualify  for payment of an additional allowance provided that they satisfy all the other  criteria for eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">It should also be noted that where a teacher successfully completes certain  other accredited courses and subject to certain other criteria, an allowance  may be payable to teachers. This would include basic teaching qualifications  with varying allowances for honours and pass and certain post-graduate  qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The Teacher Education Section also manages the Teacher Fee Refund Scheme. This scheme was initiated in 1998, under the Programme for Cooperation and Work (PCW) to provide funding towards the cost of the course and examination fees incurred by primary and post primary teachers on successful completion of in-career development courses. The courses must be  relevant to the teaching profession and approved by the Department and school authorities. Qualifying courses must be of benefit to their schools as well as of benefit professionally to the teacher concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1657">My Department is indeed open to the concept of multi-school campus arrangements  as this can have many positive outcomes, including the reduction in land take  required for school development.

            <p eId="para_1658">The Deputy will be aware that I have recently announced a review of the  procedures for the establishment of new primary schools under the Commission on School Accommodation.  A number of policy issues have to be considered as part of the review, including the issue of both minimum and maximum school sizes and the question of diversity of school provision. It is expected that this review will be completed and the revised arrangements put in place within a two year time frame.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except  in areas where the increases in pupils numbers cannot be catered for in  existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.

            <p eId="para_1666">In July of this year I launched the National Plan for Equity of Access to  Higher Education 2008-2013.  One of the key objectives of this plan is to  mainstream our approaches to improving access to higher education, including  reflecting the importance of access in the funding model for the sector.  Since  2006 the Recurrent Grant Allocation Model (RGAM), which is the Higher Education Authority (HEA) model for allocating funding to the universities and other institutions, has included an allocation for under-represented groups in higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">The purpose of this funding allocation is to reflect the costs to institutions  of attracting and supporting students who come from non-traditional  backgrounds.  The funding applies a 33% additional per student weighting linked  to the number of students from under-represented groups. This approach is being reviewed in context of more detailed data that has been gathered through an ‘Equal Access' data collection mechanism.  This new mechanism, for the  gathering of standardised data on students' social, economic and cultural  background, was introduced as part of the registration processes of the  majority of higher education institutions last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">As well as under-pinning the extension and development of the funding model,  developments of the evidence base for access will advance a number other key  objectives of the National Access Plan.  It will enable better strategic  planning for access at both sectoral and local level, in particular the setting  of new national and institutional targets for participation by  under-represented groups. It will also support meaningful evaluation of the  impact of policies to broaden access and participation in higher education.</p>

When every school has made a census return and each form has been fully processed and added to the database, a series of statistical tables is produced giving up to date information on various indicators such as overall enrolment in primary schools, average class size, teacher numbers and pupil teacher ratio.   Schools are asked to return their forms to the Department by the end of October each year.

          the reason more than €1 million has been spent on renting prefabs at a school (details supplied) in County Waterford over the past ten years despite the fact that this school could have had its major building project completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1945">The school to which the Deputy refers was given approval to rent temporary accommodation while awaiting a new school building.  The original project brief for the school was for a refurbishment and extension consisting of six additional mainstream classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation to cater for a long term projected enrolment of a Principal and 16 mainstream class teachers.  This project proceeded to architectural design, based on the project brief as above.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">In 2005, my Department reviewed the long term projected enrolment for the school.   Reviews of this nature are essential for all proposed projects in order to ensure that what is being designed continues to meet the long-term needs of the school and such reviews are in accordance with Department of Finance Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector.  Having considered all options, my Department recommended that the brief for the project be changed from 6 additional classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation to a new 24 classroom school at the rear of the existing site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">The proposed project to provide the new school is in architectural planning and is currently at the detailed design stage of the planning process.  Because of competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1949">Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of €300 million, have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009. The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible. The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1952">The Student Support Bill was published in February 2008 and provides the legislative framework for the reform of the administration of student grants and the amalgamation of the existing four student grant schemes into a single unified scheme which will be provided for by way of regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">The Bill concluded Second Stage in the Dáil on the 30th April 2008 and it is anticipated that it will progress to Committee Stage shortly. A number of amendments are currently being considered, arising from a review of the Bill following the Second Stage debate and further consultations since publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">The Bill is part of an overall programme of legislative and administrative reform, which will facilitate the introduction of significant service level improvements in the administration of student grants, providing for greater consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. It will include guaranteed timeframes for the assessment of grants, an independent appeals procedure and more efficient arrangements for handling applications and making payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1955">This new, significantly more customer-oriented system of administration will provide for a more simplified and accessible applications system, much greater speed and consistency in processing student grant applications, more transparency and accountability in the awarding of grants and regular, on-time EFT payments for students.  The roll-out of these very considerable service level improvements will also require the development of an IT system, which it has already been agreed will operate as a shared service across all 33 VECs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1959">My Department has not issued guidelines to schools on this matter and it is not an issue that has been raised as causing particular difficulty in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">In general, it is my Department's view that both parents should be encouraged to take an active interest in their children's education and it is to the benefit of the children and the school when they do. It is appreciated that practical difficulties for schools can arise where parents are separated. However, my Department's approach to the issue of the rights of separated parents to involvement in their children's education is that the rights of both parents should be respected and given meaningful, practical expression in matters such as school reports, attendance at parent/teacher meetings and other school functions and that generally both parents should receive the same information and level of co-operation from the school. The only qualification to that approach would arise where the best interest of the child required a different approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">Schools are best placed to exercise their own judgements as to what is appropriate in each individual case given their particular knowledge of the individual circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1967">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 to 52, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The table sets out details of expenditure by SFI programme at the 31st October 2008.  Arising from the recent Budget process SFI has been allocated €179.3 million for 2009 in respect of capital expenditure for research grants to third level institutions and related activity. This represents an increase of 4% on the Revised estimate capital allocation to SFI for 2008. It is not possible at this stage to provide a definitive breakdown at detailed programme level for 2009 given that funds will be allocated in the context of existing commitments and in accordance with the quantity and quality of future research proposals received by SFI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">However, given the current economic challenges and as part of the SFI strategic planning process for 2009-2013, SFI has evaluated its programmes to align them fully with the core priorities of the SFI mission and the objectives of the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006-2013. In this context SFI has decided that the UREKA Supplement and STARS programme will not be funded in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">The STARS programme, which had expenditure in 2008 of €435,000, will not be funded by SFI in 2009 due to the decline in demand for laboratory placements by secondary teachers new to the programme and a shift towards delivery of Education and Outreach activities under other SFI programmes, such as the Centres for Science Engineering and Technology and Principal Investigator programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">The UREKA Supplement, which had expenditure in 2008 of €413,000, will not be funded by SFI in 2009 based upon feedback received from the undergraduate users and faculty providers of the programme. This feedback identified the SITES sub-programme of UREKA as being more productive than the SUPPLEMENTS sub-programme. The latter will not be funded in 2009 in favour of the former.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">SFI has also decided not to run a Call for Proposals under the Stokes Lectureship and Professorship programme in 2008. This decision is based on the fact that the Stokes 2007 call resulted in twice the number of appointments than originally planned due to the excellent quality of applications received. SFI considers that it is appropriate to allow time to fully evaluate the newly appointed Stokes candidates from the first call before embarking on a second call.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">For similar reasons a new call under the Research Professor programme will not be launched in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2014">I understand that the case referred to by the Deputy relates to the practice of the company concerned imposing a charge on customers who pay their bills by means other than by direct debit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2015">The National Consumer Agency has received a number of complaints in relation to this practice from consumers. I am advised that the Agency met with the senior management of the company concerned on a number of occasions. Arising from these discussions, the company agreed that this charge would only apply to new customers of the company recruited after 27th November 2006 and that new customers would be made fully aware, before signing up for the company's services, that a charge would be imposed if they did not choose to pay their bill by direct debit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">In so far as the application of VAT to the charge mentioned in the Deputy's question is concerned, VAT legislation provides that VAT is chargeable on the total consideration in respect of or in relation to the supply of goods or services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever except the VAT itself. Accordingly, all charges to customers for the provision of the services in question, including handling or processing fees, are subject to VAT at the rate of 21.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">Whilst the actual practice of imposing charges of this nature is not in breach of consumer law, I remain of the view that such charges should not be imposed in a manner that unduly impacts on consumers, particularly vulnerable consumers.  In this regard, I understand that the National Consumer Agency continues to meet with the company concerned in relation to a range of issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_2020">I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">Since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have led three trade missions on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.  These were to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), London and Zurich.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">The mission to the UAE took place from 24th — 28th November last.  In all, 88 companies and organisations took part in the mission during which 32 contracts and agreements were signed by Irish businesses from a variety of sectors, including construction services, engineering, architecture, software and financial services.   The value of the contracts and agreements signed was € 40 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">The event in London took place on 9th October 2008 and the programme in Zurich was on 11th and 12th November 2008.  In London, I hosted the Embassy's annual Software Dinner, which was attended by a select number of Enterprise Ireland's technology clients and one Údarás na Gaeltachta client, along with their nominated guests.  The mission in Zurich was focussed primarily on the Life sciences and Financial Services sectors.  It is anticipated that these two events will assist the participating Irish companies to generate a significant volume of new export sales. These companies are also expected to secure contracts in a number of other regions, based on the relationships built at those two events.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">As these three trade missions were concerned primarily with expanding trade and not with attracting foreign investment, it is not appropriate to link this work directly with the specific creation of new business and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">One of the participating companies on the recent trade mission to the UAE was from County Kildare.  There were no other instances of Kildare addresses being given by participants, but it could be the case that some other companies, based in multiple locations, may also have operations in Kildare.</p>

          the action she will take, in view of the significant price and VAT difference in Border areas and the consequent loss of business and employment in Border counties as a result, to address this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2027">As I said last week in response to a similar PQ, the fiscal positions of both countries are very different. In this regard it should be borne in mind that Ireland already has a low tax economy by comparison with other competing economies, especially in the area of direct taxation on both business and labour, which has a direct impact on all companies and workers in the State.  This lower starting position for taxation makes it more difficult to reduce taxes further.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">As we are all aware, we are running a significant budget deficit for this year.  Suggestions by some commentators that Ireland should replicate UK fiscal policy by reducing our standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost in excess of €1.1 billion in a full year.  Reducing the standard rate to the same level as that in the UK (15%) would cost almost €3 billion per annum. In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that any policy to reduce VAT in the hope that it will boost spending has to be assessed with caution as much of its benefit would likely flow out of the State given the openness of our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">My Department does not have programmes or policies to specifically support the retail sector.  In response to ongoing concerns in relation to the level of price differences north and south of the border, I have arranged to meet with Retail Ireland to seek explanations on the differences.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">However my development Agencies are actively supporting firms in the border region.  To further strengthen Irish businesses and employment in border region, Enterprise Ireland will continue to drive improvements in innovation, competitiveness, productivity and management capability in Irish companies.  There are currently 2 full time enterprise development programmes ongoing in the border region. This involves business incubation and training for 25 entrepreneurs.  Enterprise Ireland has also run 4 Enterprise Start Programmes in the region during 2008.  This is a part time support programme to facilitate people who wish to develop and grow an early stage business idea.</p>
            <p eId="para_2031">To assist companies with innovation and R&amp;D, the Institutes of Technology in the border region have been approved €2,485,773 in 2008 for a total of 18 specific projects. Furthermore, up to August 2008, there were a total of 112 innovation vouchers approved to SMEs in the border region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">With regard to smaller enterprises, the County Enterprise Boards are working to stimulate economic activity and to promote an enterprise culture at local level.  In 2007 Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth and Monaghan CEBs paid over €1.5m in grant aid to 111 clients and assisted in the creation of 243 net jobs in these counties.  In 2007 2,525 people participated in training through the border CEBs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2036">A delay in collection of the revenues due impacts on the level and timeliness of financial resources available to the Government.  The Deputy will also be mindful that such delays facilitate businesses, large and small, which, by withholding tax payments and using those monies to improve cash flow, gain unfair competitive advantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2037">In this context, I am advised by Revenue that it expects that taxpayers and businesses organise their financial affairs in such a way as to be able to discharge those tax compliance responsibilities in full and on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">However, where particular difficulties arise, I am further advised by Revenue that it is prepared to work with a business towards restoring timely payment of its tax debts. Crucial to Revenue's ability to work with a business in such circumstances is the quality and timeliness of engagement by the business with Revenue. Permission from Revenue, to pay a tax debt by way of a phased payment arrangement is a concession which is considered in exceptional circumstances, and must be fully justified by reference to the particular circumstances of the business concerned. Revenue has emphasised that any phased payment arrangement will include interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_2068">Paragraph 16 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 comprehensively sets out the charge that is to be paid by each covered institution that benefits from the Guarantee, including any administrative costs incurred by the State in the process of the Guarantee.  This is amplified in the Guarantee Acceptance Deed executed by each covered institution, which provides that each covered institution shall reimburse certain legal and other costs incurred in the process of the Guarantee.  While the detailed costs are not determined at this stage, these will be recouped from the covered institutions in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_2070">The Government recently agreed to undertake a new round of Value for Money and Policy Reviews covering the three year period 2009-2011.  Building on our experience from the 2006-2008 round of reviews and also taking account of the OECD's recommendations, we are making a number of improvements to the process.  The major changes are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">In the 2009-2011 round of reviews there will be a particular focus on four big spending sectors — Health, Education, Social Welfare and Justice, which between them account for almost 75% of total gross expenditure in 2008.  Each of these four areas will conduct one review per year in the new round, while all other line Departments, plus the Office of Public Works and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners will conduct two each over the three year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">Topics for review will be linked to the high-level objectives in the Annual Output Statement of the Department concerned and will be targeted at significant areas of expenditure where there is greatest potential to add value and influence policy developments.  Review topics will be selected annually to give Government more flexibility to target reviews each year at areas where it is believed they can add most value.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The independence of the reviews will be enhanced by having reviews carried out by specialist staff in Departments rather than line Divisions; by having the Evaluation Unit in my Department directly involved in carrying out reviews in conjunction with the Departments themselves in each of the four big spending sectors; by having the Steering Committee for each review headed by an independent Chairperson selected from a panel of recently retired senior Officials and also by having my Department represented on each Steering Committee</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">I have also asked the Value for Money and Policy Review Central Steering Committee to report to me annually on the impact of reviews carried out in the previous year and on the implications of those reviews for the Estimates process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">Finally, completed reviews are to continue to be made available to the relevant Select Oireachtas Committee and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Regarding the part of the Deputy's question relating to approval of an independent cost benefit analysis of Dublin Airport's proposed parallel runway, the Dublin Airport Authority falls within the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Transport and I suggest that the Deputy raise the matter directly with him.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2078">As part of a fiscal stimulus package, the UK Government reduced their standard VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% on a temporary basis with effect from 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009.  There are no plans to make a similar reduction in the standard VAT rate in Ireland or to reduce the rate to the UK level of 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">It must be recognised that our starting point is different from the UK's.  We already have a low taxation economy, especially in the area of direct taxation, both income and corporation taxes, which has a direct impact on all employment in the State.  This lower starting position for direct taxation makes it is more difficult to reduce taxes further.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">Already we are borrowing over 10% of all day to day spending on public services (before capital spending). This is unsustainable and we faced difficult choices in bringing forward corrective measures.  In the recent Budget, the Government introduced a general package of revenue-raising measures to fund key public services in this regard, one measure of which was increasing the standard VAT rate by 0.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Each 1 percentage point reduction in our standard VAT rate would cost around €450 million in a full year. For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate by 2.5 percentage points would cost around €1,125 million in a full year.  For Ireland to reduce the standard VAT rate to the UK level of 15%, which would mean a reduction in the standard VAT rate of 6.5 percentage points, would cost almost €3 billion in a full year.  This is equivalent to around two and a half times the amount of revenues to be raised in a full year through the new income levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">Some of the goods and services that will be affected by the increase in the standard rate are alcohol, cigarettes, cars, petrol, electrical equipment, furniture, telecommunications, cosmetics, confectionery, soft drinks and adult clothing and footwear.  The effect of the 0.5% increase in the standard rate is that goods and services that apply at this rate will increase by around0.41%.  In other words, it means an increase of 8 cent on an item costing €20, or 41 cent on an item costing €100.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">It should be noted that around half the value of good and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard VAT rate and therefore are unaffected by the recent Budget changes in Ireland and the UK.  For example, all Government services, local authorities, hospitals and schools etc., are exempt from VAT.  The majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes are at the zero rate of VAT.  Furthermore, the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT applies to housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services, and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">Although the reduction in the UK standard VAT rate will have an impact on the price differential on some goods between the North and the South, I would point out that the UK have increased excise on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% reduction in VAT on those items. Consequently there will be no reduction in the price of those products in Northern Ireland as a result of the reduction in the UK VAT rate to 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">As a small open economy, many of our standard rated goods are imported, and cutting the VAT rate could benefit the economies from which we import more than our own. In other words, while, it might help the consumer, it would not be the most effective way of helping our own economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">There are other means of stimulating the economy, outside of the VAT system.  The Government is providing a long term fiscal stimulus through capital investment of approximately 5% of GNP, which is twice the average in the EU. This fiscal stimulus will not only support jobs in the short term but will also add to our long term productive capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Irish taxation policy has given us a significant competitive advantage over the past 15 years.  We have ensured that we have had the lowest levels of direct taxation on income, therefore we have had marginally higher indirect taxation. That model of taxation has worked well for our economy and will be even more important now in leading us back to the path of economic growth.  According to the latest OECD data relating to 2007, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU for single, married one-income and married two-income couples on average earnings.  A low tax wedge makes it easier for employers to employ staff.   After the Budget changes, we are still one of the lowest taxed economies in the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_2089">The 178th annual exhibition of the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) was selected and assembled by Members of the RHA.  The Members of the RHA viewed over 3,000 submitted works of art, and chose 535 of what they considered to be the very best.  From this exhibition, nineteen works of art were chosen by representatives from Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park with the expert advice and assistance of the Art Management Office of the OPW.  Two art works were also selected from the exhibition for Leixlip Garda Station by the OPW Project Architect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">The RHA has been in existence since 1823 and has a remit for excellence in the visual arts covering the island of Ireland.  Members and Associate Members of the RHA may only be appointed if they can demonstrate professional status and a proven track record in their art, whether it be painting, sculpture, original print-making, lens based or multidisciplinary art.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The art works purchased by the OPW were funded under the Government's per cent for art scheme.  They include paintings, limited edition original prints and photographs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">The per cent for art scheme has been Government policy since 1997.  The publication of Public Art: Per Cent for Art Scheme, General National Guidelines — 2004, encourages every public body delivering capital construction projects to implement the scheme.  Limits apply to funding available under the per cent for art scheme, with the maximum art budget for projects in excess of €12.7 million, being €64,000.  Over the past decade, the OPW has been committed to implementing this policy and adheres to the policies set out in the National Guidelines.  The OPW Art Management Office has produced an Art Management Handbook that informs the OPW staff involved in management of capital projects about the procedures to be followed in relation to art projects.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2165">I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 76 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">Section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 provided a statutory entitlement to persons aged 70 and over to a medical card, regardless of income, with effect from 1st July 2001.  In relation to Part 8 of the details supplied by the Deputy, I wish to clarify that persons aged 80 and over did not have a statutory entitlement to a medical card prior to 1st July 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">The Government's proposal, to be effected in legislation, is that automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over will end on 31st December 2008, and with effect from 1st January, 2009, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over will be €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.  Persons whose income is above the specified thresholds will have until 2nd March 2009 to advise the Health Service Executive that their income is above those limits.  After that date, their medical card will no longer be valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">As part of the means test, any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single) / €72,000 (couple) will be disregarded and only interest from savings above these figures will be considered as income for means testing purposes. The Health Levy will not be payable by people aged 70 and over. In cases where one member of a couple is aged 70 or over and the other is under 70, both will qualify for a medical card if their joint income does not exceed €1,400 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">People whose gross income is above the stated thresholds may, depending on their personal circumstances, still qualify for a medical card or a GP visit card under the standard means-testing arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">The objective of the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme is to ensure that the medical card benefit is available to those who are unable without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves and their dependants. The Government decision to remove automatic entitlement to a medical card from persons aged 70 or over and to increase the relevant income thresholds is aimed at ensuring that public health funding is used to help those most in need and is sustainable for future years as the proportion of older people in our population increases substantially.</p>

            <p eId="para_2172">The Department of Education and Science is responsible for the statutory provision of education in Ireland. There is no requirement under the Disability Act, 2005 to provide speech and language therapy services in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">Under Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, children under five years have been entitled to an assessment of their disability needs since 1 June 2007.  In preparation for the roll out of the Disability Act to older age groups and pending the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act, 2004 increased funding has been provided in recent years to the Health Service Executive to increase therapy supports to school going children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">In 2008 additional funding of €9.8M was provided to the HSE for the creation of 140 multi disciplinary posts, including speech and language therapists, to enhance the provision of services for people with disabilities. In Budget 2009, an additional €20m was allocated for health and education services for children with special educational needs. €10 million of this allocation will be provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE), and €10million to the Department of Education and Science. It is intended that this additional funding will enable the services provided to children with special educational needs to be enhanced and strengthened. The additional €10m allocated to the HSE will provide for 125 additional therapy posts in the disability and mental health services, targeted at children of school-going age. This will provide an additional 90 posts in the disability services area, to include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists for children's disability services.  There will be 35 additional posts for the child and adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists for new and existing multidisciplinary teams.</p>

            <p eId="para_2397">The Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention Scheme was drawn up in response to EU guidelines in relation to the provision of public funding for airports, including small airports. It represents a different approach from the former Marketing, Safety and Security grant scheme which it replaced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">Under the scheme, financial support can only be made available on an annual basis towards expenditure incurred in providing core airport services (air traffic control, security/safety, emergency services, etc) on foot of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) contract between the Minister and each airport. Airports must show that they are endeavouring to contain their costs. They must also maximise aeronautical revenues and funds generated by non-core activities (e.g. shops, catering, car parks).</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">It is my policy to encourage the regional airports to run their businesses on a commercial basis, without relying on Exchequer subvention.

He failed to present and was classified as evading his deportation on 27 May 2005.  On 31 March 2006, he came to the notice of the Gardaí and was arrested.  He was detained in Cloverhill Prison pending the enforcement of his Deportation Order.  He was subsequently removed from the State on 4 April 2006.

In addition, i.e. since 10 October 2006, a person who is refused refugee status and who has been served with a notice of intention to deport is afforded a fourth option, viz. to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">On 9 January 2008, a valid application for Subsidiary Protection in respect of the person concerned was received in my Department.

Confirmation to this effect was received from her legal representatives by letter dated 26 March 2008.  Following consideration of the information submitted, it was found that the person concerned and her daughter were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection under the Regulations.  She was informed of this decision by letter dated 8 April 2008.</p>

On 30 October 2008 I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of the person concerned and her daughter.

They presented as required and were given a further presentation date.  They are due to present again on Thursday 4 December 2008.  The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the person concerned and her daughter must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.</p>

The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <p eId="para_2471">I wish to advise the Deputy that the Board of Management of the Project  advised the Director of the Probation Service by letter dated 7th October that it was the unanimous view of the Board that the facility should be closed.  In that letter the Board indicated that it shared the concerns outlined in the independent review of the Project, one of four Adult Probation Residential Facilities, which formed part of the review report.  That report can be viewed on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">In the intervening period the Probation Service has worked with the Board of Management to effect an orderly closure of the project in its present form.  I am advised by the Director of the Probation Service that this work is progressing to plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">As I have already indicated I want to find the best option available to meet the addiction needs of the client group of the Probation Service.  To that end my Department, in cooperation with the Probation Service, are working to achieve a viable alternative that will meet the individual needs of the client group of the Probation Service, thus adding value to the work of the Service in the community in that area.  I expect that this exploratory work will be completed early in the new year and that will inform decisions on the future of the House.</p>

For the period 2005-2009, Irish Aid has allocated €850,000 towards development work with the Roma community in Kosovo, and a further €200,000 has been provided for the World Bank's Roma Education Fund, which has benefited the Roma community in eleven countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Kosovo.</p>

            <p eId="para_2541">This issue was the subject of a Seanad adjournment debate on 11th November which was answered by my colleague, Minister of State Peter Power, where he outlined the efforts by my Department to raise the issue, including with the UN Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) authorities, the International Civilian Office in Kosovo, and at EU level.</p>

            <p eId="para_2545">On Thursday, 27 November, together with Chief Executive of the Football Association of Ireland, Mr. John Delaney, I announced the appointment of Terry Conroy as the new FAI welfare officer for Britain.  This initiative is a direct response to concerns that the welfare needs of young Irish players who travel to Britain to take up positions at professional clubs be addressed.  The vast majority of these young people are ultimately released by their clubs and some experience considerable hardships, including gambling and alcohol difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">The new welfare officer will liaise with clubs in Britain on behalf of players and their families, particularly in cases where difficulties arise in relation to alcohol, substance abuse or gambling.

            <p eId="para_2549">Throughout the recent crisis in Mumbai, our Embassy in New Delhi and our Honorary Consulate in Mumbai maintained close operational contact with the Indian authorities.  On my instructions, a diplomatic officer from the Embassy travelled immediately to Mumbai to set up a crisis centre for Irish citizens at our Honorary Consulate there.  Throughout the days of the crisis this diplomatic officer, together with our Honorary Consul and other staff at the Consulate, kept in contact with the Mumbai Police Command Centre, as well as with other EU and international emergency operations.  The Embassy in New Delhi kept in contact initially with the Europe West Division of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs and subsequently with the Control Room established at the Ministry of External Affairs to coordinate liaison with foreign missions in relation to the emergency response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">My Department provided consular assistance to over 30 individuals who contacted them or whom they were able to contact. Thankfully, there were no Irish casualties but some Irish citizens had been in hotels attacked by the militants.  All of these managed to escape without injury, though some were deeply distressed by the experience. Assistance provided to them included replacement of travel documents that had to be abandoned when the attacks took place, travel arrangements home or out of Mumbai and general advice about the situation and safety issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2551">Information was provided by the Consulate and Embassy to the Department's Consular Section in Dublin and the Crisis Centre set up to assist with briefing families at home.  The Department's website carried reports and updates on the situation and contact details throughout the crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2552">In terms of my own contacts with the Indian authorities, I spoke with the Indian Ambassador in Dublin on 27 November, the day after the attacks in Mumbai began, to convey my sincere condolences on behalf of the Irish people at the tragic events which were taking place.  I expressed the hope to the Ambassador that the Indian authorities would be able to resolve the current situation without further loss of life and that those who carried out or plotted these attacks would be brought to justice.  Relations between India and Ireland have always been close and I wanted to assure him of our sympathy and prayers.  As we in Ireland know all too well, terrorist atrocities such as those which took place in Mumbai serve no purpose other than to kill and injure innocent victims, Indian and foreign alike, and to sow panic and suspicion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2562">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE), is designed to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State scheme.

            <p eId="para_2563">Apart from the excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residency condition and a means test or who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or HSE payment may qualify for basic supplementary welfare allowance.

His claim for jobseeker's allowance is now closed on the basis that documentation requested by the Department has not been provided.  Payment of supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement has been suspended pending investigation by the community welfare officer of his continued entitlement to these payments.  The Executive has advised that he should contact the community welfare services directly in order to discuss his entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2569">The development of a National Carers' Strategy is a key Government commitment in both the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 and the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">A working group, chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach, is working on developing the strategy.  My Department provides the secretariat to the working group which also includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as FÁS and the Health Service Executive.  Developing the strategy involves consultation with other government departments and bodies not represented on the working group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">The Department has met with a wide range of organisations including the Equality Authority, Combat Poverty Agency, Citizen's Information Board, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the National Disability Authority to discuss this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">A request for submissions from the public was published in regional newspapers in early March. The closing date for submissions was Friday 18 April 2008.  There was a good response from individuals and organisations and the submissions received are being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">Towards 2016 commits the Department to hosting an annual consultation meeting of carer representative groups and relevant departments and agencies.  Such a meeting was held on 23 January 2008.  Representatives of 12 groups and 9 government departments and bodies attended.  The theme was the National Carers' Strategy and groups were given an opportunity to comment on the draft terms of reference and to raise other issues considered relevant in the context of the strategy.  I was very pleased to launch the report "Listening to Carers, Report on a Nationwide Carer Consultation" produced by the Carers Association in partnership with Caring for Carers Ireland and Care Alliance on 30th of June this year.  The issues raised in this report are currently being considered as part of the development of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">The commitment to the development of a National Carers Strategy also includes a commitment to appropriate consultation with the social partners.  An update in relation to the strategy was provided to the social partners plenary session in February.  The first of two consultation meetings with the social partners was held on 8 May 2008.  Key issues raised were recognition for carers and their work, access to suitable health services, income support, training, gender issues and balancing employment and care.  The inter-departmental group is currently working on bringing the carers strategy to completion.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2581">I propose to take Question Nos. 133 to 138, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2582">The overall number of active defined benefit schemes registered with the Pensions Board at the end of 2007 was 1,319.  The number of active defined contribution schemes was 98,483.  The active membership of these schemes at that time was 530,933 and 269,465 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2583">The Pensions Act provides for a minimum Funding Standard which defined benefit pension schemes must meet on an ongoing basis.  Generally speaking, the Standard requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them to discharge accrued liabilities in the event of a scheme winding up.  Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years.  The Pensions Board can allow a scheme up to ten years to meet the standard in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2584">In 2007, 81% of defined benefit schemes reporting to the Pensions Board passed the Funding Standard.  Most of those schemes failing the test had a funding proposal in place.  It is expected that the number of schemes failing the funding standard will increase significantly in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">Estimates suggest that defined benefit pension schemes have sustained some €20 billion of investment losses this year.  While it is expected that the number of schemes failing the Standard will increase sharply as a result of current market conditions, the extent of the problem will not be fully apparent until schemes carry out end of year actuarial assessments and report the results to the Pensions Board as required under the Pensions Act.  In recognition of the current market difficulties and the difficult decisions that pension schemes will face, the Government has put in place a number of short-term measures to ease the pressure on schemes.  It has been agreed with the Pensions Board that an additional six months will be allowed for trustees to prepare funding proposals.  This will mean that schemes will have 18 months to review the situation with sponsoring employers and to formulate proposals for recovery.  These actions are being taken to alleviate the current situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">Members of Defined Contribution schemes have also been exposed to investment losses.  In such schemes the risk is borne in full by the member.  Many of these schemes are relatively immature and for many people there will be adequate time to recoup some or all of the losses which have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">There are particular concerns for those who may be at, or close to, retirement.  Good practice would suggest a conservative approach to investments in the last number of years before retirement but anecdotal evidence suggests this may not have been applied in some cases.  Members of defined contribution schemes are required to purchase an annuity at the point of retirement.  In the current environment, these scheme members could realise a significant loss in the value of their pension fund.  In the circumstances, the Department of Finance is currently working out the details on how such scheme members could avail of a period of up to two years to purchase an annuity.  There is, of course, the risk that those availing of the deferment option could sustain further losses and this will be clearly outlined in guidance notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">The Government is working with the Pensions Board, representative organisations and the social partners to find ways to ease the pressure on schemes by striking a balance between the long-term nature of pension savings and the need to ensure short-term security of accrued benefits.  As outlined, it has already taken some short-term measures in this area.  The long-term response to the situation is being considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions and any changes proposed will be announced in the context of the overall framework for pensions which the Government has indicated it will announce in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2590">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  A mortgage interest supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">Mortgage interest supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €13 because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">The Executive has advised that the person concerned is not entitled to mortgage interest supplement as her combined income from employment, one-parent family payment and family income supplement is sufficient to meet the total mortgage interest on the loan.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision of the community welfare officer it is open to her to appeal against the decision to the Executive's designated Appeals Office.</p>

Notification of individual allocations to local authorities for the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability in 2009 will be made following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2009.  My Department is in the process of liaising with all local authorities regarding their funding requirements under the schemes in 2009.  In line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the total financial provision secured for housing in 2009 will allow for the level of funding allocated towards housing supports for older people and people with a disability next year to be increased by 8% over the initial estimate for 2008. This provision will enable local authorities to continue to effectively respond to the housing needs of these target groups through the payment of increased numbers of grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">While the primary objective of the suite of grants schemes is to facilitate the continued independent occupancy of their own homes by older people and people with a disability, their operation also supports a certain level of activity in the construction sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2624">My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007 — 2009 includes more than 50 major water and sewerage schemes with a value of more than €464 million for County Galway.  There are a further eight schemes worth in excess of €114 million included for Galway city.</p>
            <p eId="para_2625">A significant share of the sewerage schemes in the Programme are in the Corrib catchment.  They include Headford, which is substantially completed, Dunmore, which is expected to finish Spring 2009, and Tuam (Phase 2), Oughterard, Claregalway, Milltown and Corofin which are being progressed as quickly as possible.  Galway County Council is also providing a new scheme at Clonbur under the devolved rural water programme which is part funded by my Department.  These schemes will play a major role in preserving and improving water quality in the river and lake.  Sewerage schemes already in place within the Corrib catchment with the aid of funding from my Department include Tuam (Phase 1), Moycullen, Cong, Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe and Claremorris.</p>
            <p eId="para_2626">With regard to water quality in Lough Corrib, EPA monitoring for the period 2004 to 2006 shows that the upper section was classified as being in a mesotrophic category, indicative of a low level of pollution, and the lower section was classified as being oligotrophic, suggesting a very low level of pollution.  Both these classifications were consistent with satisfactory water quality conditions and were based on the level of total phosphorous and chlorophyll measured on at least 12 occasions in each of these years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2627">Since December 2006, a new monitoring programme has been in place to meet Water Framework Directive requirements.  Based on data collected in 2007, and 2008 under this programme, the interim water quality classification of Lough Corrib will be ‘moderate'.  This is due, <i>inter alia</i>, to the presence of roach in the lake and the effect on other fish populations.  It does not reflect any change in water quality conditions from earlier EPA water quality reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2628">There is ongoing liaison between my Department, other State agencies and local authorities on the co-ordination of policies and actions to protect and secure water quality in all areas.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 and 2007, were developed in close consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Teagasc and are supported by an enhanced package of financial supports for farmers and cross-compliance systems operated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

            <p eId="para_2630">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).  The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.  These Regulations transpose EU Directive 2003/4/EC on Public access to environmental information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2631">Transposition of EU Directive 2003/35/EC on Public Participation in certain environmental decision making procedures requires the amendment of a number of consent systems relevant to two existing Directives — the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive.  The process to transpose the Public Participation Directive is already well advanced, with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems.  The planning consent system has been amended and is now fully compliant with the Public Participation Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2632">The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006 introduced a number of key measures which are designed to ensure that projects which go through the new strategic consent process are subject to even greater public scrutiny than projects which go through the normal planning process, both at pre-application and application stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2639">The person named finished his contract in REPS 2 on 30 September 2007 and received all payments due under that contract, and has since applied for REPS 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_2640">REPS 4 is a measure under the current Rural Development Programme 2007-13 and is subject to different EU Regulations from the preceding versions of REPS. Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">The process of checking and approving applications is subject to a detailed set of procedures designed to meet national and EU audit requirements, and in line with these requirements the various stages of the process are assigned to different grades of staff.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that the process was temporarily interrupted.  I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released fairly soon.  The second instalment of 25% cannot be paid before the last REPS on-farm inspection has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3, and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year. Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1Cs) returned before 5 December, 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2644">Those farmers who held a sugar beet quota during one or more of the years 2001, 2002, 2004 were entitled to have the Single Payment Entitlements topped up. However, as neither of the persons named held such a quota, they were not automatically entitled to have their Single Payment adjusted. The father of the persons named did hold such a quota and he chose to request that his payments be divided equally between the persons named, as provided for under the rules governing the Single Payment Scheme. The process of assigning the sugar beet entitlements proved complex, as both persons named were already participants in the Single Payment Scheme. However, the complex recalculations of the entitlements position of both beneficiaries has now been completed and the payments due to the persons named will issue shortly.</p>

In accordance with the EU Regulations governing the new Rural Development Programme, no payments under REPS 4 have yet been released this year other than those in the Table above.  Under these Regulations, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.</p>

I am pleased to say that, with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission, the industrial action was brought to an end and work resumed last week.  The administrative checks are now at an advanced stage and I hope that payments of the 75% instalment can start to be released fairly soon.

Staff in my Department's local offices are currently engaged in processing the annual payment applications for these farmers as well as the REPS 4 cases.  Where possible, payment will issue before Christmas on valid REPS 3 applications (1Cs) returned before 5 December 2008. At this time of the year the workload of local office staff is therefore exceptionally heavy, and while every effort is being made to release all payments promptly it is not possible to avoid delays entirely.  I have asked senior management in my Department to give me regular updates on the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2692">The sheep sector is a significant beneficiary of the main schemes operated by my Department. Sheep farmers receive an annual estimated €126m. under the Single Farm Payment and an annual estimated €60m. under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme. In the case of  REPS, some €84m. is paid annually to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">The sector is also benefiting from measures that have been put in place following the Sheep Strategy Report. These include Breed Improvement, Quality Assurance and additional promotional measures from Bord Bia on home and export markets. Bord Bia will spend over €1 million this year on sheepmeat promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">Additional support to the sheep sector will be considered in the light of the outcome of the recent CAP Health Check. That outcome provides that an additional amount of some €24 million annually will be available to Irish farmers from 2010 onwards. That amount may be used to target specific sectors in need of assistance and represents money that would otherwise not be available to farmers due to the complex rules surrounding the Single Farm Payment. Support may commence in 2009 by utilising funds from the National Reserve, which are expected to be in the region of €6 million to €7 million, and these will be supplemented from 2010 with the unspent Single Farm Payment funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">As I indicated following the completion of the Health Check, I will consult relevant stakeholders as to how these additional funds can best be spent. To that end I will meet with them on 11th December to consider their views and possible options.</p>

This compares to 265 payments totalling €6.27 million during the calendar year 2007.   As the Deputy will be aware, the closing date for completion of work under this Scheme is 31 December 2008; payments will therefore continue to be made in 2009 under this Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2766">My Department's Bovine TB eradication programme is based primarily on the diagnosis of disease using the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin test (SICTT), which is generally referred to as the TB skin test and which is an EU approved test.  I should explain that no test is 100% accurate and the ‘sensitivity' and ‘specificity' of the skin test is a function not just of the test itself but also of the environment in which it is used.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">The sensitivity and specificity of the skin test has been assessed under Irish conditions as 91-98% sensitivity and 99.8-99.9% specificity and is considered to be a highly accurate test.  More recent research indicates that the specificity of the test as performed in Ireland is at least 99.95%.  At the specificity level indicated, for each 1,000 tests performed in the course of the eradication programme, between 0.5 and 1 non-infected animal is expected to be deemed a reactor.  There is no method currently available to isolate such individual animals from the routine TB infected reactors detected under the programme.  This test limitation is recognised under the EU Directive 64/432/EEC, which allows a rapid de-restriction of herds which are deemed to be not infected following epidemiological and laboratory investigation.  My Department operates a ‘Singleton Protocol' policy to accommodate such cases.  The outcome for herds under this policy has been evaluated for 2005 and 2006 and a paper has been prepared for peer-reviewed publication.  Some 5.5% of the 6,386 herds restricted under the eradication programme for 2006 were derestricted early under this protocol.</p>

            <p eId="para_2769">A key objective of the TB eradication scheme is the prompt removal of reactor animals direct to a designated factory for slaughter.  My Department currently arranges and pays for a national reactor collection service to remove reactor animals from holdings.  In general, reactors are removed within one week of acceptance by the herd owner of the valuation attributed to the animals through the independent valuation process and generally within 3 weeks from the date of test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">In order to promote compliance with the policy objective of my Department, the rules governing the payment of compensation to herdowners for reactors provide for a reduction in valuation or compensation payments where farmers are responsible for delays in the valuation process and/or the removal of reactors/depopulated animals.  These reductions to valuation payments are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">5%   where delay is 3 –   5 days</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">10% where delay is   6 – 10 days</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">25% where delay is 11 – 15 days</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">50% where delay is 16 – 21 days</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">100% for any longer period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">In addition, if a herd owner has not moved a reactor off the holding within fourteen days of a formal notice having been served, my Department may take control of the reactor and dispose of it as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">In general, herd owners cooperate very well in facilitating prompt valuations and speedy removal of reactors in the interests of disease control.  However, there have been some instances over the years where herdowners failed to cooperate in this process and penalties have been applied to compensation payments where appropriate.  Since records on the number of cases involved are not currently maintained centrally, the information on the precise number involved is not readily available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2779">Since 1996, it has been the responsibility of herdowners to make the necessary arrangements with their private veterinary practitioners to have the annual TB and Brucellosis herd tests carried out and, in general, unless reactors are disclosed the herdowner pays the testing veterinary practitioner for carrying out these tests.  This system has worked well since its inception and I am not aware that veterinary practitioners experience any major difficulty in collecting their fees from herdowners.  In any event, any such problems are primarily a private contractual matter between the veterinary practitioner and the herdowner.  Where such difficulty results in a refusal by a veterinary practitioner to carry out a test, it open to the DVO to arrange for the test to be carried out by a different practitioner and, where the test is carried out by a veterinary practitioner from the DVO, to charge the herdowner for the cost of the test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">With regard to testing paid for by my Department, there has been no difficulty in securing funding since 1997 for the payment of veterinary practitioners carrying out TB testing and Brucellosis sampling and, as far as I am aware, no veterinary practitioner has refused to carry out testing because of the level of payment available.</p>

            <p eId="para_2783">In accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 64/432/EEC, all eligible bovines that are exported to other member states are subject to a 30-day pre-movement TB test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">For trade within Ireland, the current legal requirement is that an eligible animals may not leave a holding, including for slaughter, unless they have been tested within the previous 12 months and the holding is not under restriction, in which case movement will be in accordance with a permit issued by an officer of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">I should point out that the TB eradication programme places strong emphasis on pre-movement testing as a key husbandry practice to assist herd health protection.  Keepers are encouraged to acquire recently tested animals as part of their overall herd health strategy decided with their veterinary practitioners.  To facilitate farmers to select such recently tested animals, it is now a legal requirement that the date of the most recent tuberculin test must be displayed on an electronic screen when an animal is presented for sale at marts.</p>

            <p eId="para_2789">In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovines and national legislation, it is obligatory to tag cattle.  In addition each keeper of bovine animals is required to register a calf on the national Cattle Movement Monitoring System (CMMS) database within 27 days of birth.  While there is no requirement for the micro-chipping or electronic identification of cattle, my Department is aware of a small number of farmers who, in addition to compulsory tagging, use electronic means of identification in the form of a rumen bolus for management purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">My Department adopts a very strict policy in relation to Ireland's cattle traceability system and conducts a range of checks to ensure compliance with tagging and registration of cattle for disease control and market reasons.  To that end a number of animals (approximately 25) have been excluded from the food chain and destroyed due to tag tampering/tag switching during the last six months.  There are a number of prosecutions pending in relation to further cases of suspected tag tampering.  Officials from my Department have also seized a number of devices which have been modified for tag tampering purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">Details of successful prosecutions are listed in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_2993">I should point out that it is difficult to directly compare the incidence of TB here with that in Northern Ireland because of differences between the respective jurisdictions in the manner in which statistics are compiled.  For example, in Northern Ireland, disease episodes first detected by means of post-mortem inspection are not included in TB statistics unless the follow-up herd test discloses further cases in the herd of origin.  Cases detected by post-mortem inspection are, by contrast, included in the reporting of disease here, irrespective of the outcome of the subsequent herd test.  Since over one third of all TB outbreaks here are first detected by means of post-mortem surveillance and, on average, some 80% of these fail to disclose further reactors during the course of that episode, it is evident that the herd incidence of bovine TB here would be much lower than the above figures suggest if they were compiled on the same basis as those in Northern Ireland.</p>

Other issues which were discussed regularly in the Forum included the ERAD compensation regime, cattle identification and control of cattle movements.

            <p eId="para_3011">The Deputy may be aware that the cap on student numbers relates to funding under my Department's Free Fees Initiative for up to 925 students in the  National College of Ireland. The college cannot expand on this limit without  the approval of my Department and the Department of Finance.  The NCI are free  to increase the number of student places that they offer outside the free fees  scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3012">Specific requests have been received from NCI to lift this cap on numbers of free fee places so as to increase places in IT and business and financial  related courses. My Department has examined the College's request for an  increase in places on IT related courses, however the view is that there is no  need for additional IT related courses at this time due to general demand being  less than places available. The request for an increase in places on business  and financial related courses will be considered further having regard to the  implementation of the recommendations of the Report by Expert Group on Future  Skills Needs on the Skills Requirements of the Financial Services sector.    Discussions are ongoing with regard to the implementation of this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_3013">Significant growth in the availability of places across the higher education system generally has facilitated improved participation rates across the board  over recent years, including in particular among the lower socio-economic  groups.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the overall availability of places in  the system generally is a more significant determinant of opportunity for wider  participation than any particular increase in places on a specific course or  courses.</p>

            <p eId="para_3015">I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy.  However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public  expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions. I  fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they  can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic  stability of the country. I have called for cooperation from all the education  partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and  as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3018">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3019">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3020">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to create staffing or funding profiles for the individual school  requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be  speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3021">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3050">I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 to 202, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3051">Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5th June 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme. This sum was broken down as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">Property Transfers €76.86m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">Cash Contribution €41.14m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">Provision of Counselling Services €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3055">In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions. This is because the Indemnity Agreement allows for cash to be substituted for property. The composition of the €128 million has changed to the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3056">Property Transfers €66m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">Cash Contribution €052m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3058">Provision of Counselling Services €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">I can confirm that the full cash contribution of €52m has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties. My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3060">As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations. Valuations of the individual properties were fully agreed and fixed at 2002 values.</p>
            <p eId="para_3061">I wish to advise the Deputy that all of the legal formalities have been completed in the case of 21 of the properties transferring under the terms of 0the Indemnity Agreement.  Details of these properties are attached.</p>
            <p eId="para_3062">In the case of the remaining properties, until such time as the matter is fully resolved, the valuations and other information pertaining to the individual properties is of a commercially sensitive nature and the release of such information may have a detrimental effect on the State's ability to secure Title to any outstanding properties. I am therefore not currently in a position to release valuations of these properties until such time as the whole property issue is fully completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">Given the complex and time consuming nature of property transfers, it is difficult to state with any degree of certainty when the entire portfolio of property will be fully and finally transferred to the State. It is regrettable that the process for the final transfer of some of these properties is not yet completed. However, I am anxious to point out that whilst the legal formalities have not been finalised in all cases, in the vast majority of the properties, good and marketable title has been fully established or the properties have been physically transferred to and are in possession of the State or 3rd Parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3064">In a small number of cases, consideration may have to be given to accepting an alternative property or cash where good and marketable title cannot be established. This has recently occurred in the case of one of the 64 properties where my Department accepted cash in lieu of a property where good and marketable title could not be established. Properties to the value of €26.79m have been fully transferred and a further €7.475m worth of properties have been handed over where the legal arrangements are almost finalised. This leaves a balance of properties valued at €31.735 where the legal transfer remains to be completed. In the case of all of these latter properties, with the exception of two, the properties are in use or are available for use by the transferee.</p>
            <p eId="para_3065">The properties were accepted in principle by my Department following receipt of confirmation from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies that it would be to their advantage to accept title to the particular property. The current or future use of these properties is a matter for each of the transferees. In relation to properties accepted in principle by my Department, these will be used to develop school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3066">I should also point out that, under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, property transferring to voluntary organisations are subject to a restriction on transfer or alienation for a period of 21 years without the prior consent in writing of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3067">Every effort will continue to be made by officials of my Department through the State's legal representatives along with the legal representatives of the congregations and by direct contact with the interested parties to ensure that all outstanding issues are finalised.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3136">I propose to take Questions Nos. 203 to 225, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3137">Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5th June 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme. This sum was broken down as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3138">Property Transfers €76.86m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3139">Cash Contribution €41.14m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3140">Provision of Counselling Services €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3141">In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions. This is because the Indemnity Agreement allows for cash to be substituted for property. The composition of the €128 million has changed to the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3142">Property Transfers €66m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3143">Cash Contribution €52m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3144">Provision of Counselling Services €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3145">I can confirm that the full cash contribution of €52m has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties. My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3146">As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations. Valuations of the individual properties were fully agreed and fixed at 2002 values.</p>
            <p eId="para_3147">I wish to advise the Deputy that all of the legal formalities have been completed in the case of 21 of the properties transferring under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.  Details of these properties are contained in a table.</p>
            <p eId="para_3148">In the case of the remaining properties, until such time as the matter is fully resolved, the valuations and other information pertaining to the individual properties is of a commercially sensitive nature and the release of such information may have a detrimental effect on the State's ability to secure Title to any outstanding properties. I am therefore not currently in a position to release valuations of these properties until such time as the whole property issue is fully completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3149">Given the complex and time consuming nature of property transfers, it is difficult to state with any degree of certainty when the entire portfolio of property will be fully and finally transferred to the State. It is regrettable that the process for the final transfer of some of these properties is not yet completed. However, I am anxious to point out that whilst the legal formalities have not been finalised in all cases, in the vast majority of the properties, good and marketable title has been fully established or the properties have been physically transferred to and are in possession of the State or 3rd Parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3150">In a small number of cases, consideration may have to be given to accepting an alternative property or cash where good and marketable title cannot be established. This has recently occurred in the case of one of the 64 properties where my Department accepted cash in lieu of a property where good and marketable title could not be established. Properties to the value of €26.79m have been fully transferred and a further €7.475m worth of properties have been handed over where the legal arrangements are almost finalised. This leaves a balance of properties valued at €31.735 where the legal transfer remains to be completed. In the case of all of these latter properties, with the exception of two, the properties are in use or are available for use by the transferee.</p>
            <p eId="para_3151">The properties were accepted in principle by my Department following receipt of confirmation from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies that it would be to their advantage to accept title to the particular property. The current or future use of these properties is a matter for each of the transferees. In relation to properties accepted in principle by my Department, these will be used to develop school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3152">I should also point out that, under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, property transferring to voluntary organisations are subject to a restriction on transfer or alienation for a period of 21 years without the prior consent in writing of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">Every effort will continue to be made by officials of my Department through the State's legal representatives along with the legal representatives of the congregations and by direct contact with the interested parties to ensure that all outstanding issues are finalised.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_645">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3216">I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 242, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3217">Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on 5th June 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme. This sum was broken down as follows: Property Transfers, €76.86m; Cash Contribution, €41.14m; Provision of Counselling Services, €10m. In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions. This is because the Indemnity Agreement allows for cash to be substituted for property. The composition of the €128million has changed to the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_3218">Property Transfers €66m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">Cash Contribution €52m;</p>
            <p eId="para_3220">Provision of Counselling Services €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3221">I can confirm that the full cash contribution of €52m has been received, including that which was accepted in lieu of properties. My Department has also received confirmation that the contributing congregations have provided counselling services to the value of €10m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3222">As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, my Department agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted, subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations. Valuations of the individual properties were fully agreed and fixed at 2002 values.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">I wish to advise the Deputy that all of the legal formalities have been completed in the case of 21 of the properties transferring under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.  Details of these properties are attached.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">In the case of the remaining properties, until such time as the matter is fully resolved, the valuations and other information pertaining to the individual properties is of a commercially sensitive nature and the release of such information may have a detrimental effect on the State's ability to secure Title to any outstanding properties. I am therefore not currently in a position  to release valuations of these properties until such time as the whole property issue is fully completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3225">Given the complex and time consuming nature of property transfers, it is difficult to state with any degree of certainty when the entire portfolio of property will be fully and finally transferred to the State. It is regrettable that the process for the final transfer of some of these properties is not yet completed. However, I am anxious to point out that whilst the legal formalities have not been finalised in all cases, in the vast majority of the properties, good and marketable title has been fully established or the properties have been physically transferred to and are in possession of the State or 3rd Parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3226">In a small number of cases, consideration may have to be given to accepting an alternative property or cash where good and marketable title cannot be established. This has recently occurred in the case of one of the 64 properties where my Department accepted cash in lieu of a property where good and marketable title could not be established. Properties to the value of €26.79m have been fully transferred and a further €7.475m worth of properties have been handed over where the legal arrangements are almost finalised. This leaves a balance of properties valued at €31.735 where the legal transfer remains to be completed. In the case of all of these latter properties, with the exception of two, the properties are in use or are available for use by the transferee.</p>
            <p eId="para_3227">The properties were accepted in principle by my Department following receipt of confirmation from relevant Government Departments and State Agencies that it would be to their advantage to accept title to the particular property. The current or future use of these properties is a matter for each of the transferees. In relation to properties accepted in principle by my Department, these will be used to develop school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3228">I should also point out that, under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement, property transferring to voluntary organisations are subject to a restriction on transfer or alienation for a period of 21 years without the prior consent in writing of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">Every effort will continue to be made by officials of my Department through the State's legal representatives along with the legal representatives of the congregations and by direct contact with the interested parties to ensure that all outstanding issues are finalised.</p>

         the number of large school projects his Department has delivered in 2008 as a result of channelling the summer works scheme 2008 funding towards larger projects; the locations of the projects; the stages they are at; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3279">Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of €300 million, have been completed.  With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">The following table highlights the large number of major projects which have been brought to completion this year with 43 new primary schools and 3 new post-primary schools completed under the programme in 2008.  In addition, 29 major primary school extension and refurbishment projects and the 15 major post-primary extension and refurbishment projects were completed in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">Taken together, these major projects reflect the concentration by my Department this year on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country and represent an unprecedented level of achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">I recognise the benefits of the Summer Works Scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible.  The  Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">Since the Summer Works Scheme was introduced, over 3,000 projects, costing in excess of €300 million, have been completed. With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 has been on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country. Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">However, I recognise the benefits of the scheme in addressing the needs of schools and I have previously informed the house of my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The details of the operation of the scheme in 2009 and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in 2009 are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible.  The  Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.</p>

            <p eId="para_3665">The decision on eligibility for student maintenance grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority, either the local authority or VEC, as appropriate.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department, except in exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3666">If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_3667">Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3668">Clause 9.4 of the TLT Scheme 2008 states that "A candidate who has completed a two year Middle Level Technician (MLT) course is not eligible for a grant in respect of a further two year or three year Higher Technical/Business Skills (HTBS) course, irrespective of whether or not a grant was previously paid, but s/he may be eligible for a grant in respect of the third "add-on" year of a related Higher Technical/Business Skills (HTBS) course".</p>
            <p eId="para_3669">Should a candidate in the future enter a course at Level 8 or higher, he/she may apply to his/her Local Authority or Vocational Education Committee in order to have his/her eligibility for grant assistance assessed under the terms and conditions of the relevant grant scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3670">In addition, the Student Assistance Fund is designed to assist students who, having commenced a third-level course, experience financial hardship that may render them unable to continue their third-level studies.  Applications for funding are made by the individual student to the Access Officer in the institution in which they are studying.  The Fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3671">Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in non EU countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_3677">The Higher Education Authority (HEA) does not collect information on the numbers of first year students failing their year-end exams.  While it is not possible therefore to provide an overall figure on failure rates, certain information is available on overall numbers progressing from first year to second year in the university sector by comparing the cohort sizes across successive academic years.  In the 2006/07 academic year, there were 18,090 first year students on Level 8 courses in the seven universities.  In 2007/08, there were 16,140 second year students on Level 8 courses in the seven universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3678">Although this indicates a gross progression rate of 89%, it does not mean that the failure rate is 11%.  For example, students may have transferred to other higher education courses, opting to sit first year again, but never actually sitting an exam before their transfer.  Other students may have taken time out from their studies to work or travel.  The real failure rate is therefore likely to be significantly below the 11% figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3679">Information on progression rates is not readily available in respect of the  Institutes of Technology and insufficient data are available to present figures for the previous five years for the university sector.  As a result of new data collation arrangements, future years will provide sufficient data for this analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3680">In relation to costs, my Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher  Education Authority (HEA) for disbursement to the universities, institutes of technology and other institutions.  It is a matter for each institution to determine how the block grant received from the HEA is allocated internally.  Under the terms of my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study.  A student who repeats a year of study is not eligible for a repeat of free fees except in the exceptional circumstances such as certified serious illness.  The third level institutions may autonomously determine the level of fees to be charged in any case where the Free Fees Initiative does not apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_3681">Third level Institutions also charge students a Student Services Charge which is levied to defray the costs of normal examinations, registration and student services.  This charge does not cover the costs associated with the setting, administering and correcting of repeat examinations offered by institutions as a second chance option for students.  In such cases the institutions determine the fee to be paid by students for repeat examinations.</p>

         the estimate of the number of schools which will lose funding as a result of the recent abolition of grants announced in budget 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3683">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.</p>
            <p eId="para_3684">Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the  Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">While I appreciate that the abolition of certain grants will make it a challenging year ahead in terms of the day to day funding of schools, I have prioritised funding for primary schools.  The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to capitation and ancillary grants for primary schools which will increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">This builds on the progress that has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200.  This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">The budget improvements involve an increase of more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3688">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">At this time the priority for my Department, within the resources available to it, is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to compile the position at individual school level, could not be justified at this stage of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">We are committed to investing in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable at the moment given economic circumstances.  I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3697">Specifically in relation to mainstream classroom teachers, the yield in savings that will result from the change in the staffing schedule from an average of 27 pupils per teacher to an average of 28 pupils per teacher will ultimately depend on the aggregate impact of the revised staffing schedule on the particular enrolment profile of all the primary schools countrywide as of 30 September last and the operation of the panel system of redeployment. The full year saving is estimated at €6 million for every 100 teaching posts saved. My Department's estimating range for the yield from the staffing schedule adjustment is 350-500 posts saving up to €30 million in a full year. The Deputy will appreciate that while the measure will only yield a portion of that saving in 2009 it is the full year yield that is most relevant given that the Government strategy is to manage the correction needed in the public finances over the coming years as distinct from the 2009 position alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3698">The estimates for savings relate to the overall position, taken in the round, and are not broken down by school size.  The proportion of the savings that relate to two and three classroom schools will become clearer when the allocation processes commences in the New Year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">An important consideration in relation to the staffing allocations for schools is that schools should be treated in an equitable manner. The staffing schedule should operate in a manner that treats schools in like circumstances equally. I have a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally what the final impact will be on the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year.  I am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the staffing position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school and there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been completed. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3702">For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools early in the New Year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3707">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3708">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that have been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3709">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year.

Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the individual school requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3712">The school to which the Deputy refers is among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools who applied for the review in August 2006. An application for review was received from the school to which the Deputy refers. Regrettably the school was unsuccessful in that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2006-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">Primary schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The Ancillary Services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3716">The Education Budget for 2009 has provided for improvements to the overall level of day to day funding for primary schools which will see funding increase from €167 million in 2008 to almost €190 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3717">The primary capitation grant has been improved by more than €21 to bring the rate to €200 per pupil and the ancillary services grant for primary schools will also be improved by €3.50 to €155 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_3718">This builds on the progress has been made in recent years that has seen the primary school capitation grant increased from €81.26 per pupil in 2000 to its current rate of €200. This represents an increase of 146% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3719">A devolved Minor Works Grant is paid to all fully recognised primary schools annually. The Minor Works Grant provides school authorities with the funds to carry out ongoing repairs and maintenance work of a minor nature on school buildings. It allows the school to prioritise how the money is spent on their schools, again using their local knowledge.  Individual primary schools receive a grant in the sum of €5,500 plus €18.50 per pupil. My Department intends to pay the next round of Minor Works grant early in 2009.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3745">I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 to 261, inclusive, and 263 to 272, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3746">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements and in view of the ominous financial circumstances that we are facing I am not in a position to reverse any of the decisions taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3747">I have made it clear in briefing material published on the 2009 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science that overall, the number of primary and post-primary teachers in schools in September 2009 is projected to be about 200 fewer in each sector compared to September, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3748">Clearly a net reduction in the number of teachers, while relatively small in terms of the overall number of teachers that will continue to be employed in our schools, will of course impact to some degree on the pupil-teacher ratio in a situation where enrolments are rising. This applies to the ratio for the country as a whole in the primary and post-primary sectors and will apply at individual county level also. There may be some differences between counties depending on the distribution of the projected increase in enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3749">I have already put it on record that I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally what the final impact will be on the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers in schools for the 2009/10 school year and this applies to final pupil-teacher ratios as well. I have been forthright with the Irish people in relation to these measures.  I am not claiming in any way that there will be no impact on the staffing position in schools generally but this will vary from school to school and there will be schools where the number of teachers will remain the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_3750">I will set out the final position when the allocation processes have been completed. The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme. The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_3751">For the moment the priority for my Department is to move ahead with the allocation processes and begin the interaction with individual schools early in the new year and I do not propose to divert staff to engage in producing estimated or hypothetical outcomes for individual counties.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_662">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3753">I previously advised the Deputy on the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 330 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will continue to establish more classes as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">Children in these classes benefit from having a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; fully qualified teachers who have access to training in a range of autism-specific interventions, including Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA), the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) and there is a minimum of 2 special needs assistants in each class. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Funding is also provided for assistive technology and specialist equipment as required and special school transport arrangements may also be put in place. My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including TEACCH, PECS and ABA through the Special Education Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3756">The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with autism. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3757">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
