          <from>Senator Maurice Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_20">The Order of Business is No. 1, referral of motion re criminal sanctions for insider dealing and market manipulation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on Irish Water and related reforms, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 1.45 p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed six minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 1.35p.m.; No. 3, Education (Amendment) Bill 2012 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to commence at 3p.m. and conclude not later than 5p.m., with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 4.50 p.m.; No. 22, motion No. 6, Private Members' business, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7p.m.; and No. 4, Patents (Amendment) Bill 2011 — Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 7p.m. and conclude not later than 8.30 p.m., if not previously concluded.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Paschal Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_22">Over the weekend, the Seanad and its future were to the fore once again in media reports.  A number of Members have been in the media, most recently the distinguished Leader.  From my experience on the other side of the House, I appreciate the difficulty the Leader has, and will continue to have, in attempting to encourage Ministers to come to the House to provide us with meaningful legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">However, I raise a voice of concern from this side of the House that in the past few weeks, in particular since the resumption, while the Leader quite correctly and legitimately pointed out that the House is sitting for an increased number of days, it is more about quality rather than quantity.  I am sure he shares our concern that the House increasingly seems to have a lack of meaningful legislation brought before it and he will take steps to try to address it in the interests of parliamentary democracy rather than in the self-interest of the future of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Health has been in the news in the past few days.  Quinn Healthcare has announced another savage increase in subscription fees.  On average, it seems there is almost a 20% increase across-the-board for all health insurance companies and in excess of 100,000 people are now leaving the health insurance scheme.  This will create enormous difficulties if the haemorrhage continues.  I hope the Leader will convey the real concern about the impact this will have on our already stretched public health service.  In that context, I ask the Leader if he will provide time for a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">It might also be practical to convey to the Minister for Health, who is coming to the House in February, that there should be a debate or some response to the report on the delivery of pharmaceuticals in Ireland by the ESRI.  The report was commissioned by the HSE and shows that pharmaceutical costs have risen dramatically in the past few years.  Some 17%, equating to €1.9 billion, of the total health budget is now spent on drugs.  The basis of the report concerned three key areas of the high factory gate price of drugs in Ireland for patent and generic drugs, more information and doctors' prescriptions being altered at pharmacies.  A doctor will inevitably provide a prescription for patented drugs and the pharmacist must respond to the drug on the prescription and cannot alter it despite the fact that the pharmacists may have a generic drug in stock costing half the price of the patented drug.  This is a serious issue at a time when it is coming under increasing financial strain.  The ESRI reports that if its recommendations are taken on board, there could be a saving of 25% or €500 million.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Health that he should take account of this report before coming to the House to discuss the new service plan.  If the Leader had time between now and February, the House could have a debate on the implications of the report, which has far-reaching consequences if its recommendations are not acted on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnWhelan" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Senator John Whelan</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I commend and congratulate the Leader of the House, Senator Cummins, on his endeavours on "Morning Ireland" this morning and his effort to outline the productive and progressive work of the Seanad and the reforms introduced under his leadership. Perhaps the point was missed by the interviewer and certain elements of the media. The Seanad can only do so much and it is restricted and limited in the new structures it can introduce. I concur with Senator Mooney that the examination of legislation is not the only function of the House, but it is its core function.  It is difficult to do that if no legislation is being produced by the Dáil.  Towards the end of the session, we find legislation being rammed through and dumped on top of us.  We cannot give it a proper examination and then we are accused of guillotining important legislation that deserves more attention.  For any media that want to pay attention, people comment on the Seanad without paying a blind bit of heed to it.  Certain elements of the media seem to be hanging the wrong man and should take it up with Deputies and elements of the Government that seem to be scapegoating the Seanad for all our political ills.  Perhaps the first shots were fired in the latest civil war on the future of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, who sometimes comes in for undue criticism and does not get much praise.  I commend the two initiatives he announced today regarding job creation.  This must remain our core priority in government.  These involve new, creative initiatives for immigrants who can play a part and have a valuable role to play.  That can be positive for the economy, and for immigrants and the new communities coming here, as was reflected on television the other night when the President, Michael D Higgins, visited St. Brigid's in Blanchardstown.  Children of more than 25 ethnic backgrounds were represented.  I commend that development because that is what we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I know that my colleagues are busy and are inundated with briefings and lobby groups but I would like to encourage them to attend an Oireachtas briefing by EirGrid across the road.  They should not just take the handout and the press release from EirGrid, which pushes its version of events.  EirGrid is doing this country and rural Ireland some disservice with its dismissive and condescending attitude to rural communities.  I call on my colleagues to ensure they challenge EirGrid to engage in meaningful consultation with local communities in the roll-out of vital strategic national infrastructure.  Two major motorways to Cork and Limerick, the M7 and M8, run through pristine countryside and areas of historic value in the heart of my county.  There was no impediment, protest, roadblock or problem because of the approach of the NRA.  However, we cannot say the same about the approach of EirGrid, which has a bully boy attitude to people.  EirGrid creates an impediment to the roll-out of important infrastructure and the taxpayer will have to pick up the tab for delays.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JillianVanTurnhout" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I encourage my colleagues to participate in the Private Members' debate on the motion proposed by the Independent group on disability support and services.  I appeal to Members to support the motion as proposed.  This is an important debate and I hope the House will support the very clear action points in the motion.  It will be led by my colleague, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I recall the Private Members' motion by the Independent group on 12 October 2011 on criminalising the purchase of sex in Ireland.  We are three months into the six-month period indicated by the Minister for Justice and Equality for public consultation.  This matter was raised in the Dáil last week by Deputy Kevin Humphreys and the Minister advised that the consultation process would be ready before the end of January.  However, I am concerned by the inclusion of a caveat in the Minister's reply that the publication of the document before the end of January is subject to resources, having regard to compelling priorities including legislative priorities.  I fully appreciate the financial times we are in and I know that the Government needs to prioritise its work.  However, the debate we had on 12 October 2011 showed a clear link between prostitution and trafficking, particularly in respect of trafficking children for sexual exploitation.  The protection of women and children from sexual exploitation must be a Government priority.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to confirm that the consultation document will be published and that the consultation process will commence without further delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I also wish to raise whistleblower legislation.  The situation of Louise Bayliss has been raised by the media in recent days.  Coincidentally, she met me last Tuesday to discuss lone parents, before she heard the news.  She is an advocate who has spoken out and we need to remember the five women she spoke out about, who were being put into a closed unit.  How do we know how many other people are in that situation if we do not produce whistleblowing legislation?  There should also be independent funding for advocacy organisations.  This does not concern new funding but the basis of funding for the organisations working as advocates.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I wish to raise the Children's Rights Alliance report card launched on Monday.  Last week, I called for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to come to the House and I suggest to the House that this is an excellent basis for discussion.  The Government has failed in the report card in regard to St. Patrick's Institution and the continued detention of children in an adult prison regime.  The effects of budget 2012 on lone parents and large families and the implications for child poverty were highlighted.  The Government got the best grade any Government has received in four years but that does not mean it is good enough.  We need to do more.  It is a wide-ranging report which looks at all aspects of a child's life and would provide an excellent foundation for a debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I support Senator Mooney in his request to the Leader to remind the Minister of Health, when he comes before the House next week, that we would like to be able to talk about generic drugs.  If he has the report in his possession and is able to answer questions on it, that would be of huge benefit.  I am stunned at what Senator Mooney reminded us of, namely the huge difference in cost between patented and generic drugs.  If a doctor automatically uses brand names the chemist is obliged to dispense that rather than generic drugs which might cost a fraction of the price.  There is no cost to the doctor but there is to the State.  We must have a discussion on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">The intention to introduce two changes was announced yesterday.  Senator Whelan referred to one, namely investment for immigrants and the removal of some of the tight controls on visas.  When I read about it I became worried because almost nine years ago I introduced the passports for sale ban in this House.  It was accepted on Second Stage and the then Government moved to deal with what I was worried about.  Those who may not have been here at the time will remember the scandals when a Minister or a Taoiseach was free to issue passports and there were no controls, as far as I could see.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">We introduced a Bill which became law.  I was worried when I read yesterday that people emigrating to Ireland with an investment could get naturalisation papers of some sort.  I understand, from what I have read, that is not so.  I am concerned that based on what I read in a newspaper, the measure does not require legislation.  I would like to make sure that we have a discussion on the issue in the House and it should happen in the very near future while it is on our agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">The Leader might accuse me of being biased.  It was proposed yesterday that alcohol should no longer be sold in supermarkets and petrol stations.  I am speaking with a vested interest.  That sort of proposal from the Joint Committee on Health and Children needs discussion and it should take place in the House at some point.  Steps can be taken and the committee has proposed some of them.  It appears to me that it would be a rather draconian step to take.  Prohibition was introduced in the United States in 1919 and abolished in 1932, but at that stage it had created many difficulties.  It is a reminder that sometimes we can be more subtle in our solutions than having to use such a big stick.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">There is an old saying, "Power corrupts".  If one turns back the clock to the end of the last term when the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill came before the House, one will find I did everything I could to protect credit unions.  I cautioned the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that power does corrupt and that he was giving too much power to Mr. Matthew Elderfield, the Financial Regulator, yet last week Mr. Elderfield appointed a special manager to Newbridge Credit Union at a cost of €423 an hour.  That is wrong.</p>

Approximately 20 credit unions throughout the country will have to have special managers.  If special managers earn €423 an hour, how much will that cost?  How long will they be there for?  It will cost over €3,500 a week.  Mr. Elderfield said a salary of €500,000 was not enough for the chief executive of AIB.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I support the call for a debate on patented versus non-patented drugs.  I raised the issue before, not just in this House but in the other House.  It is important for a number of reasons.  There is potential for a huge saving to the State and taxpayer.  I have a view which I have no problem in expressing.  GPs throughout the country get a lot of sweeteners and goodies from those supplying branded name drugs which is why when writing prescriptions they specifically prescribe the drug that is most expensive for the client because they are looking after those who look after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">I support the call for a debate on health.  I understand the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will attend the House shortly.  I ask the Leader that during the debate the Minister would have due reference to the impending crisis in our maternity hospitals.  Hospitals like the Coombe, the Rotunda and the CUMH are probably the safest places in the world to have a baby.  Ireland has a great international reputation.  The difficulty is the amount of qualified midwives retiring in the next few weeks.  A master of one hospital has said it will cause a problem.  Hospitals are slow to respond and they may then have to have a knee-jerk reaction.  There is a problem because when that happens there will be a dire shortage of midwives in our hospitals. One solution does not fit all. In certain cases in the public sector, such as the provision of adequate numbers of midwives for maternity hospitals, recruitment should take place. It is important that we debate the issue. Some 30, 40 or 50 qualified midwives could retire and will not be replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I support the initiatives announced by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, today.  Citizenship or passports will be given to wealthy people from Russia, China and Arab countries who come here and create jobs.  It is similar to the passports for sale scheme that was so maligned.  I am not saying it was right but rather than the scheme being abolished, if it had been properly regulated I have no doubt businesspeople would have availed of it.  I know a wealthy Russian who has a sick child and would like to have regular access to Ireland, rather than a passport, and has promised to invest in a number of things including the Cork-Swansea ferry.  Such investments would be good for Ireland, and create and sustain jobs, without being abused.  I support the initiative.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I refer to the reissuing of medical cards by the central processing unit.  I am glad to say a number of substantial changes have occurred since we last met.  The most important is that medical cards will no longer be withdrawn from people awaiting the processing of a card because of the delays in the unit.  Cards will be renewed for a three year rather than two year period, and for four years for those aged over 66.  The Cathaoirleach will recall that I asked the Leader two weeks ago if we could visit this unit to see what is causing the delays.  The response I have received is that we do not do that type of thing around here, or words to that effect. I respect that this is the situation.</p>

I ask the Leader to contact the office of the Minister of State to ensure we buy fully into that.  The Members in this House who have rightly complained about this matter since last May are now getting results.  We want the opportunity, through the Leader, to be part of the presentation that will happen in the coming weeks.  I thank the Leader for his efforts to date on thismatter.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I commend the Leader, who is on a sticky wicket regarding the debate around reform of Seanad Éireann.  I commend the House for an excellent debate last week on job creation.  Will the Leader set aside time without a Minister and without the media but within this Chamber before the end of February for a debate on what our ideas would be around Seanad reform?  This should be without a vote and without a whip, and we may possibly be talking to ourselves because the media does not listen, but it will ensure that whatever our ideas might be, they will be on the record.  Ultimately, all we can do is change around the deck-chairs on <i>Titanic</i>. We cannot undertake radical reform because it is not within our remit or power and we do not have any constitutional ability to do that. However, we should put ourselves on the record, talking to ourselves, with the media listening to our ideas.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">Notwithstanding our difficulties, which are great, as a respected member of the international community, from time to time we should consider other matters.  In that context, I wish to congratulate the Holocaust Education Trust of Ireland and Mémorial de la Shoah in Paris on the launch of its exhibition, The Holocaust in Europe, which was launched on Monday evening in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Time in no way diminishes the horror of the Holocaust.  Not alone was it European anti-Semitism which caused it, but in our own country the then Irish ambassador's advice was that, "Ireland should be protected from the contamination that would result from granting residential visas to Jewish refugees."  This resulted in practically no visas being granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">In this context, I suggest that we in Europe, Ireland in particular, should take a balanced view of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  While supporting the Palestinian right to statehood, we should also fully support the right of the State of Israel to exist within secure borders.  I ask the Leader to note this and to urge the Members of the Seanad to visit that exhibition.  I wish to inform the Leader and the House that in my position of education spokesperson for Fine Gael in the Seanad, I will be writing to schools to ask them to visit this exhibition.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I commend the Members of the House who took part in the debate on RTE this morning, to which I listened with great interest.  One thing that was missing, and we should direct our attention to filling this gap, is the list of the achievements the Seanad, with the greatest difficulty and given all the constraints it has suffered under, has managed to accomplish over many years.  I think of Senator Quinn's important Bill on the construction industry, for example, as well as the role this House played in the Civil Partnership Bill.  There is a series of things we have done that have not been noticed, including amendments to the NAMA legislation which made it accountable to the Oireachtas for the first time, although that took place at 2.30 a.m. and was never covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">We ought to be able to present to the public what we have done.  We should stand on our record.  We should admit our limitations but we should say that while those limitations should also be looked at, we have had very significant achievements within them.  Among these achievements have been considerable debates on the economy.  I ask for a series of debates on this issue.  For example, I note with great interest today that the man who founded the Davos meeting has indicated that capitalism in its present form is not working.  That is a very significant point, coming from that source, and is something we should look at.</p>

During the week, these mná tí received a letter from Roinn na Gaeltachta capping the number of students they can keep in their accommodation at 14.  The summer colleges provide a major livelihood and bring big revenue into Gaeltacht areas every year.  The students spend in the local shops and their parents visit at weekends, stay in the hotels and take students out for lunch and so on.  All of these women are tax compliant and most got a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta to do up their houses to accommodate the students.  Now, they are being told they cannot do that.  As we speak, in the Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis area of west Kerry, 87 students are left without accommodation for the coming June, another case of no room at the inn.  I ask the Minister to attend the House for a debate on why he has issued this directive or, at the very least, to give us an explanation through the Leader.</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_79">There is no doubt the burning issue in Ireland is the payment today of the unsecured, unguaranteed Anglo Irish Bank bond of €1.25 billion to people who invested, speculated and gambled.  Some of these are secondary bondholders who will have bought those bonds at a cheap prices but will get paid in full, with interest.  That payment is happening at a time when we can see services to schools being curtailed and teachers being lost, where in hospitals throughout the country managers and the HSE are trying to contain their budgets but, in doing so, are closing wards and theatres.  Three thousand staff will be lost in the HSE this year, more than half of whom, some 1,500, will be front-line staff.  It is outrageous that all these cuts are happening at a time when this country, namely, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, will sign off today on a cheque for €1.2 billion of taxpayers' money.  This is in spite of the fact that in opposition those same parties lambasted the previous Government for doing exactly the same thing.  They claimed that not one further cent would be paid unless burden-sharing was agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">How can the Leader, his party and Government stand over all those cuts which impact deeply on the quality of life of people in this country while the same Government is signing off on that guaranteed unsecured bond?  It makes absolutely no sense.  An earlier speaker mentioned special managers.  There are special advisers who are being paid, in full and over the odds, extreme amounts of money while children with special needs are seeing their services cut.  That is the kind of Ireland we are living in today.  It is not what the people voted for.  They voted for real change but we have not even discussed this matter properly.  The fact that it was raised by one of the Independent Members, not by anybody from the Government parties, shows how out of touch Members in this Chamber are when it comes to the real issues.  The big issue in Ireland is the payment of that bond and it should be discussed today in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">In following Senator Mooney's comments, which set the tone on another issue today, as did other contributions, I compliment the Leader on his handling of what was a difficult interview.  He was barracked continuously but handled it in a very fair and balanced way in regard to the constitutional requirements and obligations of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I say to Senator Mooney that, of course, we want meaningful legislation.  However, regardless of a review, constitutionally this House, as much as the other House, has to deal as required with all legislation, meaningful or otherwise.  As Senator Norris pointed out, the House has an excellent record in handling legislation, as I believe Senator Mooney would agree.  Many amendments down through the years have been accepted in this House and various Ministers of different political persuasions have paid serious compliments to this House regarding its standard of debate.  They have often been — I will not say not more obliging but more persuaded — by the weight of the arguments proposed to accept amendments in this House more than they have in the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">Despite the barracking he received from an interviewer who was doing what he was paid to do, the Leader got across, in addition to legislation, the usefulness of the public consultation committee set up by this Seanad and the question and answer format we have very usefully employed with Ministers, thereby getting them to be more responsive and accountable to this House.</p>

Saturday was also the 93rd anniversary of the start of the War of Independence.  I was honoured to be in Soloheadbeg for the commemoration and am also honoured to be on the 2016 commemoration committee to which a former Member of this House, Maurice Manning, has been appointed by the Taoiseach as an advisor.  He stated of 2016 — as the quotation is from a newspaper, we all know how accurate that can be — that he can see the date being marked by a series of seminars.  I do not believe the people expect such an historic event to be marked by seminars.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In regard to the Seanad and reform thereof, there are things we can do in this House.  Deputy Seán Sherlock spoke yesterday about a statutory instrument.  It might be news to the broader public outside the House that 75% of all legislation in this country is done by way of statutory instrument, without any scrutiny by any legislative official.  Ministers sign EU directives into Irish law at a rate of 733 per year.  I ask the Leader that this House be given the role of scrutinising statutory instruments as they have a considerable effect on Irish life, as we all know.  They deal with everything from the septic tanks issue which is being raised throughout the country, to issues concerning bogs, water directives and others.  All those issues come about because of statutory instruments that sail through this Parliament, signed by Ministers without as much as a by-your-leave to the democratically elected representatives of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">When one considers that we are responsible for only 25% of the laws enacted every year in this country one must wonder whether the system is working.  The answer, obviously, is that it is not.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">Will the Leader invite the associated Minister, who I assume is the Minister for Justice and Equality, to this House to discuss how we should be able to scrutinise statutory instruments as part of our workload in the Seanad, given that 733 of these were passed in a 12-month period without anybody looking at them, scrutinising or amending them to see how they might affect Ireland?  This shows how the system, not only of the Seanad but of the Dáil, does not work.  It needs to change now.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">However, to cut to the chase in regard to Seanad reform, one action we have tried to pursue is the format of questions and answers with Ministers when they attend.  When we see a consultant obstetrician, Dr. Gerry Burke, talking on television about the risk of losing babies or mothers we know a very serious line is approaching.  Generally, consultants do not make statements of that nature.  Will the Leader ensure that when the Minister for Health attends the House in two weeks' time to discuss the health service plan we can maximise the time available by being allowed to ask questions?  We can stick to the questions and answers routine in order to allow as many speakers as we can.  The fear is that in trying to reform that part of our work we should slide back, as we have shown ourselves to do on the Order of Business, by adding subjects every day.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I join those who congratulated the Leader on his comments on "Morning Ireland" today but I will not do so.  If the Leader cannot answer Cathal Mac Coille's straight question by stating where he believes the Taoiseach is wrong, he is not showing the independence of mind and approach which is the only basis on which the Seanad can recommend itself to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Senator Norris got to the core of the issue when he pointed out it was on those occasions when the Seanad scrutinised legislation effectively that it proved its role, its value and its importance.  Senator Quinn introduced the Construction Contracts Bill in recent times.  In the previous Seanad I tried to play a role on the issue of civil partnership albeit on a different side to Senator Norris.  I and others led a lonely battle to try to secure amendments to the ill-fated referendum on Oireachtas committees of inquiry.  We were not helped in these matters by a Government approach that tried to impose the guillotine on the very work the Seanad was supposed to be doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Independent Senators, therefore, have given leadership but it is time the parties followed by showing themselves to be independent-minded and effective scrutineers of legislation.  Our capacity to scrutinise legislation at length and effectively that will prove our case to the public, not any of the most recent reforms, as welcome as they are given they involve more contact with the public and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The Leader and the Government could redeem themselves by giving us some answers to the important issues raised by Dr. Burke, the consultant obstetrician in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  It is a serious matter that 20% of midwives could be lost.  We have prided ourselves, as Senator O'Donovan said, on having the lowest maternal mortality rate in the world but we need to seriously examine the issue of morbidity, sickness and so on and we cannot compromise the quality of care given to women in pregnancy.  As Dr. Burke said, the provision of safe maternity services is among the most fundamental duties of government because having babies is the core business of human beings.  His most serious comments are welcome and they deserve a timely response from the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">Last Friday I had the privilege of attending the Cork Person of the Year ceremony.  A monthly award is given and, at the end of the year, one of the 12 is picked.  For instance, Maureen O'Hara was selected as Cork Person of the Month.  However, Liam Casey won the annual award.  He is from Cork but he works in China and employs more than 1,200 people.  He made two points at the presentation.  The first is that every time a report is published in a newspaper in Ireland, it is available around the world within five minutes and he emphasised the importance of being positive.  The second issue he raised was that the perception foreigners have of Ireland is totally different from the perception we in Ireland have of ourselves.  The perception abroad is more positive than the way we are portraying it in Ireland.  It should be borne in mind when we debate issues and we want something in the public domain that the entire world is looking in and many positive developments are taking place in Ireland.</p>

In some areas, the number of deaths from a particular condition is much higher than others and this reflects how people live their lives.  Education programmes could be undertaken and, in Cork city, the university, the hospitals and the HSE are working together.  This should be taken on board in health care planning and this issue should be included in a debate with the Minister for Health, which I understand will be taken within the next two weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I also welcome the news that Ms Louise Bayliss was reinstated.  I speak with some personal authority on the issue of whistleblowing in the health service.  This is a major problem at a time the service faces constraint.  There will be problems and if we cannot depend on people who know what they are talking about, such as my old friend and colleague Dr. Gerry Burke who spoke out earlier, being protected when they point out deficiencies, there is a chance we will find that major omissions in care and departures from standards of care will not get into the public domain where they can be debated and, I hope, corrected.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Parenthetically, on two occasions since I returned to the country in 1993, serious attempts were made by agencies of the State to silence me.  In the first instance, it was suggested to the hospital where I worked in the 1990s that there might be a reconsideration of whether they would fund the rebuilding of the institution if it could not shut me up.  On the second occasion, in the early part of his millennium, when I notified the statutory agency responsible for the oversight of ethical clinical trials about a departure from high standards, I found that I was suspended for one year as a clinical researcher as a reward for my whistleblowing.  This is a problem which does not only affect people on temporary contracts such as Ms Bayliss but it can occur throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">While I am supportive of what the Minister of Health is trying to do, including his proposal for a new grade of consultant, and he is making a number of innovative changes which will enhance the quality of the health system, a number of specific problems arise.  Eva Cassidy and Bob Marley, two singers whose haunting music will be recalled by many Members, both died in their 30s from a disease called malignant melanoma.  Anyone who has seen the Cancer Research UK advertisement which has Eva Cassidy singing "Fields of Gold" without welling up with emotion is a cold person.  It is one of the most moving evocations of the tragedy of the young dying from cancer I have seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Nothing worked particularly well to fight this disease over the years but a little revolution has taken place in its treatment.  In particular, a new drug, Ipilimumab, has recently been shown not only to have a modest impact on prolonging the survival of patients with incurable disease but would also appear to offer to a small number of patients the prospect of long remission and possible cure. The drug is expensive, costing €120,000 per patient for one cycle of treatment.  The reality is the incidence of malignant melanoma in Ireland increased from 400 to approximately 800 cases a year between 1998 and 2008 while the number of patients who died almost doubled.  It is likely that both figures will increase reflecting the sun exposure Irish people have become more used to.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Will the Leader bring to the Minister's attention my extreme concern that he makes right decision?  Apparently, the decision has been handed to him regarding the approval of the use of this drug in the treatment of patients with malignant melanoma.  A recent expert committee, comprising four oncologists and three bureaucrats, convened on this and the oncologists all said the drug needed to be approved while the bureaucrats all said "No".  I was informed by VHI yesterday that it would not cover its use either.  The country could experience a problem in the next while with this disease, which is relevant to between 40 and 60 patients per annum.  The drug offers them the prospect of a good outcome.  When we pay €10 million a year to the Health Information and Quality Authority, which has not saved one life but which has a large, muscular public relations department, we have some problem with our priorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">Most people receive a letter from their mortgage company or bank outlining changes to their mortgage rates.  My research shows there are almost 2 million residential units in the State, of which between 800,000 and 900,000 have a mortgage attached to them.  Every interest rate change is notified to mortgage holders by post and those who hold two or three mortgages will receive two or three letters at a cost of 55 cent per letter in addition to the cost of stationery and time involved.  We more or less own the banks and the notification of each mortgage interest rate change costs almost €500,000.  Given the way the markets are now, the rate could change every month and, therefore, there could be 12 changes a year, which would cost up to €6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">I understand that under the terms and conditions of a mortgage, people must be informed by post but we have gone beyond that in this day and age.  To save the taxpayer money, rate changes should be communicated to people by the media, e-mail or text message or by them contacting the bank themselves.  I received a letter recently outlining my rate change and I am sure every other Member who has a mortgage received one.  The letter does not last two minutes because one tears it up and throws it in the bin.   The interest rate may increase from 4.5% to 4.7% and the cost of informing people is not justified.  I asked Deputy Michael McCarthy to table a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, may have a view on the matter because ultimately the mortgage holders will be paying for it and I do not think that is justified.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">The first initiative is the immigrant investor programme, which will grant visas to participants on a five year basis.  From the outset the level of investment is expected to range from €400,000 to €2 million, with an average of €1 million.  The type of investment envisaged is the purchase of low interest Government bonds, capital investment in Irish business and, in some cases, the purchase of property from NAMA.  The second initiative is the start-up entrepreneur programme, which will provide immigrants with good business ideas in the innovation economy with exportable prospects and funding of €70,000 residency in the State to develop their businesses.  These initiatives highlight the Government's commitment to job creation.  We are ahead of the curve with these creative approaches and they will reap rewards for us.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">My good friend, Senator Mac Conghail, was despondent about the fact that we are paying the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank.  I share his despondency and I do not think there is a person in Ireland who is not outraged that the country has come to the situation whereby we have to pay bondholders.  Unfortunately, however, in other elements of the debate a deep dishonesty is being put forward.  We must ask ourselves whether the Government has an alternative.  Some people say there is an alternative but the Government believes it does not have one.  Any alternative proposal must at least be sensible and not drawn from the patients of lulu land.  The simplistic argument that some parties in this State are putting forward is scaring people for the sake of rabble rousing and scoring political points on this, the most serious of all the issues we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">There is some evidence from Denmark to suggest that we have an alternative, although it is not very strong.  In 2010, two banks, each of which was worth €1 billion, defaulted after failing to make their payments.  Denmark has a very diversified banking system, with 148 lending institutions.  The consequence of the default was a 10% increase in banking costs across the banking industry.  This happened in a country that controls its own monetary policy and is not part of the common currency area.  If we are to defend the opinion that we can default without consequence, I hope people will consider that example.  If the interest rates for Denmark increased to 10%, one can imagine what would happen to borrowing costs in a country that is part of the common currency area with no control over monetary policy and an unhealthy banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I seek a debate on economic policy and ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the House in order that we can debate in a reasoned way and hold all the arguments, whether for and against the course of action we are taking, up to scrutiny in the cold light of day.  I hope all Senators will at least have the courtesy and decency to acknowledge the complexity of the issue.</p>

We have Facebook and Google, to name two of the big companies, as well as a number of smaller companies.  We are about to introduce a statutory instrument to change a law that will affect all these companies.  A previous speaker referred to statutory instruments in general but this particular measure will shape the web.  Wikipedia closed down completely last week as an objection to this approach.  Adrian Weckler is an IT correspondent with the <i> Sunday Business Post</i> and has his own blog.  The justification presented for the statutory instrument is that it is necessary for copyright reasons.  Everybody knows it has to be done but if one is going to introduce a measure which will have a drastic effect on the web in this country, one should do so by legislation and guidelines rather than in a statutory instrument that gives power to judges to decide if something is legal.  Adrian Weckler has written that the IDA “may have to alter its pitch to large US social media firms who may have been thinking of setting up in Ireland”.  We should not brush this aside and leave it to the judges in the courts.  I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, to come to the House in order that we can have an opportunity to debate his proposals to see whether we can implement them by means of legislation, as is done in most countries.  T. J. MacIntyre, a lecturer in law, wrote on his blog that the web should not be shaped to the will of commercial companies. I plead with the Minister of State to deal with this matter by means of legislation rather than statutory instrument. </p>

For several days all one could read in the newspapers were stories about special advisers to Ministers getting pay increases, which is outrageous given that they are already well paid.  In one of yesterday's newspapers it was reported that expenditure on special bonuses for staff was €652,000 in the HSE, €559,000 in the Revenue Commissioners and €329,000 in the Department of Social Protection. Why are these bonuses paid? I cannot see why somebody in the Department of Social Protection or Revenue should be entitled to a bonus for doing a job that he or she is already well paid for. My biggest concern, however, is that the HSE is paying bonuses when nothing about the delivery of its services suggests that staff should be getting bonuses. I suspect that somebody in the HSE is getting a bonus for sticking within a budget. I am concerned about this because if these staff are getting bonuses to stick within budgets, the needy people of this country are being deprived of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">When I go around rural Ireland to listen to communities complaining about the downgrading of their smaller schools, I have no answers when they throw this kind of stuff in my face.

He promised that the HSE would engage intensively with nursing homes.  I refer in particular to Crooksling in Brittas, County Dublin.  Day in, day out I find this country to be frustratingly inefficient.  If Germany was defeated in two world wars but it got its act together, why can we not deal with our inefficiencies?  One Department does not talk to the other.  HIQA produced an excellent report on Crooksling and its idyllic environment but the HSE wants to close it down.  There are 20 high-dependency patients in Tallaght hospital that are costing the State €7,000 per year.  I said to the people up in Crooksling that if they got their costs right there, logically, why could the 20 high-dependency people from Tallaght hospital, who need very special care and attention 24 hours a day, not be moved to the Brittas public nursing home, in an idyllic site with first-class treatment?  One lady whose sister is in the home said that the care the patients got was magic.  Mr. David Walsh, who is the key person in the HSE dealing with Crooksling, has not been available for the last month despite many conversations.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">Senator Mooney, acting Leader of the Opposition, raised the question of the Seanad meeting for two days this week and spoke about the need for more legislation to be brought to the House.  I work with the legislation and the Ministers available at any point in time.  The Seanad returned on 11 January, although this would normally be its first day back.  We are well ahead of what happened heretofore in that regard.  I agree that we need more legislation, but we have three Bills on the agenda for today and tomorrow.  Senators can expect the Seanad to sit for three and four days for the remainder of this session because legislation is beginning to come through from committees.  I have also asked Ministers to initiate more Bills in the House and hope that will be the case.  Tomorrow we are taking the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2011, which is being initiated in this House; therefore, we are making considerable progress on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator Mooney also spoke about the report on the cost of pharmaceuticals, which was also mentioned by Senators Quinn, Coghlan and others.  Certainly, the cost of patented drugs in comparison to that of generic drugs is frightening.  Perhaps we can arrange a debate on that report with the Minister in early course.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Senator O'Donovan complimented the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on his proposals with regard to immigrant visas, which are aimed at assisting in job creation.  Senators Noone, Quinn and others also raised that issue.  I believe the regulations will come into place in March.  Perhaps we could arrange for the Minister to come here to explain what he proposes.  I am sure he would be more than willing to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Senator van Turnhout raised quite a number of items on the Order of Business.  We will be debating our Private Members' motion this evening.  With regard to the six-month consultation process on the criminalisation of the purchase of sex, I will certainly contact the Minister and ask him what progress has been made.  The Senator also mentioned the reinstatement of Louise Bayliss, which we all welcome, and outlined the need for further whistleblowing legislation, as did Senator Crown.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Senator Quinn mentioned generic drugs and the issue of immigrant visas. He also mentioned the report on the sale of alcohol, which was announced yesterday and deals with the sale of alcohol in supermarkets, garages and so on. I will try to organise a debate on the report in the House and will contact the relevant Minister with a view to doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Senator Sheahan mentioned the cost of special managers in credit unions.  It is absolutely disgraceful that, as he mentioned, amounts of over €400 per hour can be paid to such special managers.  The Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Hayes, will be in the House within the next week or two, and perhaps the Senator can address his concerns to him at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Senator O'Donovan mentioned the problems arising in maternity hospitals because of the number of midwives who are retiring.  This issue can be raised with the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he is here to discuss the health service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Senator Landy outlined the changes in the processing of medical card applications, which are welcome, although there are still a number of problems in that regard. However, I am delighted to hear that the people in the primary care reimbursement service will come to Leinster House in the next couple of weeks to explain what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Senators Mac Conghail, Cullinane, Gilroy and others spoke about the payment of €1.25 billion to bondholders.  The Government's current priority is to renegotiate our bailout agreement with the troika to reduce the cost of the bank bailout.  The rewards for success in this regard are far greater than in any knee-jerk reaction of refusing payment of Anglo Irish Bank bonds.  The focus is on reducing the cost of the funds used to capitalise the banks. I certainly share the public's dismay at the cost of this policy and the delay caused to the State's recovery, but, unfortunately, the truth is that the vast majority of Anglo Irish Bank debts were paid off under the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Senator Mac Conghail also complimented, with Senator O'Keeffe, the Irish people involved in the films nominated for Oscars. I am sure we would all like to join in these congratulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Senator Mac Conghail also called for a debate on Seanad reform similar to the one we had on job creation ideas. I requested that members of the groups send me a bullet point list of ideas from their various members which had been expressed in the debate. The debate was well attended, with more than 30 Senators taking part, and we had some excellent suggestions. It is my intention when I receive those bullet point lists, which I hope will happen today, to present them to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. I hope we will be given feedback on these ideas, as requested by Members, with an update on how the Government is making progress on them. It was an excellent debate which lasted for more than three hours, and it was certainly a good thing for the Seanad to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Senator D'Arcy mentioned the exhibition on the Holocaust in Europe, which he recommended that people visit.  He also called for a balanced view of Palestine-Israel relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Senator Norris stated that we should mark the achievements of this Seanad. He also called for a debate on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Senator Moloney spoke about the restrictions on mná tí in the Gaeltacht. I do not know whether it was the Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht who put this cap on mná tí. I will speak to the Senator afterwards and try to get information for her.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Senator Paul Coghlan also spoke about the reforms in the Seanad and its achievements in the past. I heard Senator Daly's comments on the former Senator, Dr. Maurice Hayes, who was one of the best Senators we ever had. He was an excellent person and is well suited to being part of the Taoiseach's team in organising the celebrations for the 1916 commemorations.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Senator Daly is right in what he said about statutory instruments, etc. Regarding EU legislation, I have written to the chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, asking that some research staff be redeployed to allow us to debate European affairs and European directives in this House. I await the response of the chairman of the commission in that regard. I am sure that the Members of this House who sit on the commission will fully support our request.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I respect Senator Mullen's comments. I am sure he is not suggesting Independent Members have a monopoly of wisdom in this House. Parties have carried out important scrutiny of legislation and will continue to do so. It is not a monopoly so far as Independent Members are concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">Senator Colm Burke spoke about the importance of being positive and a perception abroad in that regard.  He called for education in health care to be discussed when we are discussing matters with the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  I am sure he will take up that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Senator Crown spoke about the deaths from malignant melanoma that could be prevented and referred to the cost of the drugs involved being €120,000.  Such an amount is cheap when compared to the cost of a life.  If people can be saved by using these drugs, cost should not come into play.  I am sure it is a matter on which the Senator will question the Minister, Deputy Reilly, when he comes into the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Senator Harte spoke about the notification by post of interest rate changes for mortgage holders.  Fortunately, it was good news in most cases, with reductions in mortgage interest rates.  I believe mortgage providers are obliged to notify customers by post.  I can raise this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, when he comes into the House in the next week or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Senator Keane spoke about copyright and Internet piracy.  I will request the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to come to the House to explain his intentions in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Senator Kelly asked what special bonuses were paid, a matter that probably should have come under the Croke Park agreement. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes will be in the House on 9 February to discuss that agreement and perhaps the Senator can address his questions to him at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">Senator White spoke about the possible closure of beds in public nursing homes, a matter she has raised previously.  I agree that consultation should take place between the nursing homes and the HSE or HIQA, whatever the case may be.  If the matter is not rectified in the meantime, I am sure she will have the opportunity on 14 February of raising those problems with the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyMulcahy" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Senator Tony Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_154">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to the House.  Water is a resource that is essential to life.  Every day we consume vast quantities of water, washing ourselves, and our clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, cleaning cars and drinking it.  Industry uses it as a key input into the production process.  Irish people use approximately 150 l of water each day.  The single biggest issue facing the country is access to good quality water in the volumes that citizens require and industry needs to function.  Hundreds of thousands of people depend on water in our taps.  One of the key prerequisites for companies deciding to set up manufacturing facilities here is water, the others being cheap energy, a benign tax environment and the availability of a well educated workforce.  Water is a finite resource and we cannot create it as easily as mother nature does.  In a country where it rains nearly every second day, one would think the stuff should be free, but one would me mistaken.  I recently heard a man with a water recovery system comment that we have world-class rain here.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The country is spending approximately €700 million a year on producing clean potable water, which works out at approximately €1.9 million a day or €80,000 an hour.  The problem is that approximately 43% of our clean water is lost through leakage and waste.  This equates to 301 million l of water a year flowing away.  In these days when every euro counts, we cannot afford for this to continue.  The solution is the establishment of Irish Water, which is a key element of the programme for Government.  By centralising control over how water is treated we can reduce water loss and save the economy vast amounts of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">We have 34 local authorities producing clean water.  We have an infrastructure that is creaking because of age and pipe makeup.  Some pipes laid early in the 20th century are corroding and reducing in size because of sediment build-up and chemical reaction.  We have a problem with the presence of lead pipes in older parts of our towns and cities, which pose a serious health risk and must be removed.  We have problems with water pressure in certain areas, with cast iron pipes — in my town of Shannon that is a big problem.  If the pressure in the mains were increased we would have more fractures and leakages.  This also poses a serious risk to life in the event of a fire as the fire brigade might not have sufficient water pressure to quench a fire.  During last winter's big freeze local authorities throughout the State had to send out emergency services to distribute water, which had to be moved around by bulk carrier to replenish areas where vast amounts of water were lost because pipes had burst.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">We need to rethink how we spend taxpayers' money.  The Government is engaged in a public consultation process up to 24 February with interested parties on how this new utility company will run and who should run it.  As vast amounts of money need to be spent upgrading current infrastructure through the relaying of pipes, and the construction of new reservoirs and treatment plants for domestic water and waste water, somebody will need to pay for this.  Irish Water will be a State company but will also require investment from the private sector.  This should not be seen as a threat to those working in local authorities who currently look after our fresh and wastewater needs, but an opportunity for new money to be invested in the latest technologies on the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">To make their jobs easier and less stressful is it not better for them to have systems that can locate failures remotely from centrally located control centres, rather than going out into the field and spending hours trying to pinpoint where pressure has been lost and finding the exact location between two points?</p>
          <p eId="para_159">As part of the EU-IMF programme, Ireland is committed to the introduction of water charges by the end of the programming period, which ends in 2013.  Under the EU water framework directive we are required to charge consumers for the cost of water and treated waste water must take into account the full environmental costs.  These requirements will lead to the introduction of water metering with the user paying the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Commercial water rates are costs that businesses must pay.  Prior to 1977 domestic ratepayers also contributed an element of their rates bill to pay for the costs of fresh water and waste water.  The Government is committed to having a fair scheme of water charges under which households will receive a free allowance with charges applied for consumption above the relevant threshold.  Households currently spend vast amounts of money on bottled water, which can cost up to €2 for a two litre bottle.  This is madness as we should be able to drink water, as we used to do, from kitchen taps without any worries about quality.  When a water source becomes contaminated the householders affected must buy bottled water or endure boil notices, such as that which occurred in Ennis between May 2005 and December 2009 when e.coli was found in the local supply or the problem of cryptosporidium in Galway's water supply some years ago.  Just this weekend, water had to be brought in by bulk carrier to residents of parts of County Limerick following an oil leak into the River Deel.  The leak affected areas such as Askeaton, Pallaskenry, Kildimo and Shanagolden.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">We are obligated under the terms of the EU water framework directive to protect our water sources.  Some 83% of water here is sourced from surface water such as lakes and rivers, 11% is sourced from groundwater such as aquifers and 6% is sourced from springs.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">In the next two to three years a programme of installing water meters to cover 1 million domestic premises will create approximately 2,000 jobs.  This scheme will give work to many of those who have lost their jobs in the construction industry and we should ensure that jobless Irish people secure these jobs.  The protection and creation of Irish jobs must be a key element of the programme.  There is no point in putting contracts to tender to be won by overseas companies which will bring in outside labour to carry out the work when thousands of Irish people are more than capable of doing this work.  It is critical that this work is done by Irish people and companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Once this part of the capital programme has been completed, substantial investment will be required in water infrastructure, including the construction of new treatment plants, pipelines, reservoirs and control centres.  This will result in the creation of new jobs for engineers, surveyors, plumbers, technicians and scientists such as microbiologists.  Additional spin-off jobs in the leisure and tourism industries can be created in areas where new reservoirs are developed as these can be used for leisure and pleasure activities such as sailing and water sports.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The regulator charged with oversight of the new utility will ensure consumers are protected and the utility is managed and works to the highest international standards.  The creation of Irish Water will result in economies of scale, fragmentation will be removed, control will be tighter through regulation, staff who have local knowledge will continue to be involved in water services, new infrastructure will be built locally and nationally and the conservation of water will take place once consumers realise that water must be paid for and waste controlled.</p>

        <speech by="#MarkDaly" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Senator Mark Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I propose to cite comments published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> of 28 June 2010:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_166">I'm against water charging.  Water is a necessity.  I've always believed essential services such as water should be delivered as a public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I believe the speaker, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, sits at the Cabinet table of a Government that is introducing water charges.  It is no wonder members of the public are cynical.  My concern is the establishment of the proposed Irish water authority.  While the Government has stated the new body will create 2,000 new jobs, it has not indicated what will happen to the 3,600 local government employees who currently provide water services.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The Minister of State need only cast his eyes a few miles north of his constituency to see the disaster which occurred under the supervision of the Northern Ireland water authority during last winter's big freeze.  In contrast to this part of the island where water supplies were affected but the problems were addressed effectively once identified, Norther Ireland Water did not have sufficient staff or resources on the ground to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Once the proposed water authority has been established, what will local authorities do?  The National Roads Authority has assumed responsibility for a large proportion of the road network previously managed by local authorities, while the Health Service Executive has assumed responsibility for health services.  I am not a great fan of the HSE because while it has worked in some areas, it has failed in others.  Its establishment resulted in the removal of powers from local officials and democratically elected public representatives.  We now face the prospect of responsibility for water being removed from local government.  As a county manager stated in Monday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, what will be left for local authorities to do?  They will have little do because we are centralising more and more services and moving in a direction that is the reverse of what the European Union tells us we should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Arguments can be made for and against the establishment of a water authority.  Local officials and council employees know exactly where a problem is when they hear of an issue in a certain area and are able to deal with it effectively.  Sending some guy in a van from Cork to deal with a water problem in Kenmare will not work because he will not have local knowledge.  We all know the importance of such knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">People in rural areas are to be required to pay thousands of euro to replace septic tanks they have legally installed.  What will happen in respect of group water schemes?  Many groups have come together to establish a water supply.  While they may have received a little Government assistance, it was not a hell of a pile.  They paid the initial set-up costs and continue to pay an annual maintenance fee.  Will they be told that having paid for their water supply, unlike people living in cities who did not pay a penny towards their water supply, everyone will be treated the same and they will be required to pay for water they have essentially paid for?  Will people living in rural areas who had to drill their own wells to secure a water supply be asked to meter their own water?  They too spent thousands drilling into the earth to secure a water supply for their families.  Having paid for and maintained this supply on the basis that the Government would not provide them with water, will they be asked to pay for it again?</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I accept that we are wasting too a great deal of water and I realise the Tánaiste was engaged in politicking when we spoke to the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on this issue in June 2010.  While the Tánaiste is a nice man, I expect he knew at the time he would not be able to fulfil his promise.  People are tired of politicians knowingly promising something they cannot possibly deliver.  This practice has dragged the reputations of all politicians through the mud.  While one accepts that everyone makes mistakes, when one makes the statement the Tánaiste made and then proceeds to establish a water authority, it should come as no surprise that members of the public hold politicians in low esteem.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Water is a precious commodity which is expensive to provide.  There is no doubt people are wasting it by leaving taps running and so forth.  If, as proposed, an allowance is provided to each family and households pay for water consumed in excess of this threshold, people will start to conserve water and it will come to be considered a precious commodity.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">A number of questions arise on this issue.  What will happen to the jobs of the 3,600 local government employees who work in water services given that they cannot be redeployed?  Will members of group water schemes be charged for water?  Will those who have drilled wells be told they must pay for their water supply despite having given so much already?  If charges are applied to such people, it will be an anti-rural measure.  We see this already with the €100 household charge for which people in rural areas will get very little in return.  If one puts in a group water scheme or one's own septic tank, one gets nothing from the Government for one's €100.  If one is living in Dublin 4, one is getting water and sewage treatment for €100.  Rural Ireland is getting nothing.  This is more evidence of the Government's lack balance, fairness and equity when it comes to raising revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I have serious concerns about Irish Water.  It will be a quango.  We are taking power away from public representatives and are giving it to unelected and unaccountable people.  Members of this Chamber all know the difficulty getting answers from the Health Service Executive, the National Asset Management Agency, the Road Safety Authority and the National Roads Authority but we are setting up another quango which will not be accountable and will take money and spend it.  If a fellow messes up, as happened in the North of Ireland, he might resign but one can be sure he will get a big fat pay off.  Currently, if there is a problem with the water supply, at least the constituent can telephone the public representative on the council to find out why.  Who will the constituent telephone in Irish Water?  The constituent will be put through to a helpline which will not be much help in trying to supply water to one's house.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Will the Minister consider this again?  We will be back here in a few years time wondering why Irish Water is not working.   As with the NRA and the HSE, we are taking more power from public representatives and giving it to a large water authority which will not be accountable to anybody, will eat public money and which, ultimately, will be sold off, although the Tánaiste was quoted recently as saying Irish Water was not being set up to be sold off but that is worth the same amount as the paper his statement to the <i>Irish Examiner </i>in 2010 was worth.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_178">Not at all.  I was quite happy to listen.  The most important thing a Minister can do is to listen to the views of Members of the Oireachtas.  I am happy to have heard many of the points made.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The reason Irish Water is being set up is to ensure the 34 local authorities and the 952 separate water supplies are brought together in a one-stop-shop and that there is a focus nationally, regionally and locally on improving the supply of water.  This is not a quango, as it has been described by some people.  Over a number of years, we will take all the experience of local authorities and move it into Irish Water.  It will not be like the HSE, which was set up by a Fianna Fáil-led Government.  It will not happen overnight because it will be done properly.  Currently, Kerry County Council or Louth County Council is written on the side of vans.  Next year it will be Kerry County Council or Louth County Council working with Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Senator Daly is wrong about staff numbers.  More than 4,200 staff work in local authority services.  He left the back-up staff out of his figure.  The Senator raised the very important issue of responding to the views of local authority staff and offering them a career choice, which they do not have currently.  There will be new opportunities for people working in local authorities locally, because Irish Water will operate a local service, regionally, because it will make plans in regard to river basins, and nationally, because it will look at strategic infrastructure.  This will be a very good career opportunity for thousands of people working in local authorities and it will be done in consultation with the unions.  This discussion today is part of that consultation.  It involves listening to Senators and to the Joint Oireachtas committee and meeting all the interested parties, specifically the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This will not be done overnight but over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Senator Daly asked what local authorities will be left with.  I do not know the figures for Kerry County Council but I know it has a big contracting out service.  A former Member of the Oireachtas supplied many services to Kerry County Council which amounted to millions of euro every year, although I do not know if it still does.  The Senator should ask his colleagues on Kerry County Council what exactly the council pays for these services.  I believe they are many and varied.  I presume they involve hedge-cutting, filling in pot holes——</p>

          <p eId="para_183">——fixing public lighting and so on.  The local authority is not going to disappear.  It will be very much there and will be very much focused on the core issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">When Kerry County Council or Louth County Council makes a development plan, Irish Water must have regard to what is in it.  In other words, if the council wants to expand zoning in Caherciveen, for example, if that is a legitimate proposal and if it is put into the development plan, Irish Water must have due regard to that.  It must take on board the future plans of the local authority and the future plans of the regional authority.  When it is planning water infrastructure, it will not make decisions rather the council, the councillors and the officials will direct where that investment should go.  That is a very key point.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">County Kerry has many disparate supplies.  I do not have the figure but I think there are more than 80 separate water supplies, although I might be wrong.  I went to County Kerry to look at them.  I went to the base of Carrauntoohil to see what was going on there and I met the county manager and others.  In fact, the Kerry county manager, Tom Curran, who is a very good friend of mine, is the County and City Managers Association's link to Irish Water.  He explained to me the problems and how they need to improve the water supply in Kerry.  Senator Daly may be aware that it has the highest level of unaccounted water in the country.  The reason is the very bad winter.  It did not have the finances to recover and improve the water supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Kerry County Council is very focused on all of these issues, as are we and as Irish Water will be.  It is a two-way process.  At the heart of what we propose is local accountability and taking account of what councils want and need.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The key point is improving the quality of water nationally.  The most recent EPA annual report on water quality for 2010, which was published just before Christmas, shows that in areas with populations greater than 5,000, we have the most pristine water in Europe.  It is the same as it is in the UK.  The problems lie with the group water schemes.  The report stated that 11% of group water schemes have problems in terms of E. coli and so on.  Those issues must be addressed and Irish Water will address them.  There were approximately 60 boil water notices last year because there were questions about the quality of water and precautionary boil water notices were issued.  With proper investment in water, we must ensure water is treated for cryptosporidium to prevent people from getting sick.  The resources which councils do not have must be readily available and the national and regional input of Irish Water should be put in focus in order that we get the resolution people need.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">On the question of metering, if one has one's own private water supply, one will not be metered.  There is no new charge if one supplies one's own water.  If one is not connected to the public water supply but to a group water scheme, of which there is a significant number, one will not pay.  However, one will have to make the scheme more efficient.  The figures are very significant there.  We looked at figures on group water schemes which brought in metering.  There are very significant savings in metering.  Nationally, the expectation is somewhere around 10% but one gets savings of up to 40% or 50% in some of the group water schemes.  Lower figures such as 16% are quite common as well.  This year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has renewed a scheme that will assist farmers who want to use a different source of water.  We are doing what the previous Government agreed to do in the EU-IMF deal.  We did not have a choice and we must charge for water but there are also other good reasons for doing so apart from the obvious financial reasons.  These reasons include health and quality of water supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The reality of change and metering is that 2,000 jobs will be created per year over the three-year period as metering progresses.  That means work for 2,000 people who are currently unemployed, such as plumbers, those who drive small diggers, site supervisors and people doing accounts.  This contract will be broken into between 150 and 200 contracts of average size with approximately 5,000 to 6,000 connections to be made.  There will be many jobs, which are needed in this economy.  The big plus is the jobs and the effect on conservation.  If we use less water as a result of this, our capital infrastructure costs will be lower.  It costs €1.2 billion for the capital and running cost of water in this country and we must make up a gap of €1 billion.  The State will be involved in supporting local authorities in this, notwithstanding the charges.  We will have more money for new infrastructure builds.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">One of the key questions is the shortage of water in Dublin.  By 2018, Dublin will have a significant shortage of water.  Ireland has a lot of water but we will have a shortage on the east coast.  If we cannot meet the gap, industry will fail and business people will not proceed, nor will planning and new industry.  We have been successful in attracting high-tech, water-intensive industry but if one cannot guarantee a supply of water, Dublin will lose out as a region and the country may lose out as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Regarding climate change, on the east coast we will have less water in future and on the west coast we will have more.  We must deal with the issues of supply and the areas that have shortages in the future.  One of the projects for the future is the abstraction of water from the Shannon, which is proposed.  The estimated costs are €500 million so we must find that sum in order to ensure the water supply in Dublin is adequate for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I refer to Dublin as the area where 60% of the population of the country lives.  The two options are to pump from the Shannon or desalinate.  Desalination involves removing the salt from the water but the problem is that desalination plants use a lot of energy and we must then deal with the brine left behind and pump it out to sea.  Desalination is not an option on the table.  A key factor is environmental sensitivity.  When the proper democratic processes are gone through, the abstraction should not take place for five months of the year.  It will not be happening all day everyday but only when water is at a higher level than normal.  We all know about flooding in the Shannon and it is clear there is an excess of water.  We are talking about abstracting the excess but not taking water when the level has dropped.  It is very important to the Shannon and the lakes area that tourism continues.  There will be no change in the environment for tourism, levels of water and the flora and fauna.  The fish in the rivers will not be affected because their environment will not change.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Those are some of the issues that are important to address.  I hope I have made the key points.  This is the listening process.  We are giving Senators our plans and we will study whatever they say.  We will come back to Senators when this process is finished because we want to make sure this plan works.  We want to ensure an accountable system.  When the big freeze came in Belfast, it was not the lack of workers on the ground but the fact that the customer service was not there.  Thousands of calls in a short period of time could not be dealt with and we have a focus on customer relations.  When the new entity is set up, people can pick up their phones and they will have a 1800 number and someone will answer the query.  This will be driven by service to the consumer and it will not be a remote, unavailable quango.  The service will be accountable and available.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I am very happy to debate in the Seanad and to attend meetings of committees.  We are determined to get this right.  The only way to do so is to put out our plans, listen to what Members have to say, take on board their comments and move forward.  I look forward to Members' contributions.</p>

          <from>Senator John Crown</from>
          <p eId="para_195">I wish to address the broad philosophy of how we are addressing the water problem.  There is a certain consistency across the public service that the way to solve real world, practical problems is to develop another bureaucracy.  I am not saying that we do not need to have officialdom and regulatory oversight.  The health service had the lowest number of specialists per head of population in the developed world 19 years ago when I first came back to Ireland.  Some 19 years later, we still have the lowest number of specialists per head of population in the western world.  We have seen a profusion of new bureaucracies, including HIQA, the HSE and the national cancer control programme.  I have always thought that we need to look at the problems and fix them and give new bureaucracies a subsidiary priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I do not live in a remote area but within five miles of this House.  Drawing a line from the American embassy to the German embassy, one passes through my front garden.  I live on the Merrion Road, across the street from St. Vincent's Hospital.  As I live at sea level, water from a reservoir does not have to be pumped up to my house.  When we had snow that was modest by European and international standards last year, we had a major problem with water provision in this relatively privileged area.  Unlike many of my Seanad colleagues, I missed the page in the Constitution that refers to my constituency.  I do not have a geographical constituency but a virtual one.  However, I live in an area and I refer to it.  In that area, we could not maintain water supplies.  Many of my friends who emigrated in the 1980s from Irish medicine came back for Christmas and the new year and were stunned that they could not have a shower at any time of the day.  I am not trying to make a case for privilege but for a real problem with infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">During the year, the manager of a Cork council stated that 50% of publicly provided water in Cork was wasted.  I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with these figures throughout the country.  We have a major infrastructural problem.  Even when we do not have freezing weather and pipe ruptures, we have a major problem with water leakage when it comes to normal, week-to-week ambient demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I have said to the Minister of State's colleagues that the three things which will determine our future as a species are probably food, water and energy.  They will determine whether civilisation as we know it will exist when our children and grandchildren are living in new societies in 50, 80 and 100 years time.  It is critically important that the water issue is taken very seriously, not just as an administrative or political problem.  The first thing we should realise is that it is a crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">We know from the Minister of State's speech that we live in a relatively privileged area in terms of water.  We live in a relatively privileged area in terms of rain, but in terms of water provision there are not many capital cities in western Europe which, when modestly challenging weather occurred, had to curtail water services to near wartime rationing levels.  It is important that we give absolute priority to fixing infrastructure.  Any resources which are going into buying, maintaining, monitoring and storing meters should only be used after the actual infrastructure is fixed and water wastage is dealt with.  When we have done that we can then encourage people to have responsible water use.  Appropriate public education could cause that responsibility in advance.  If we have the money for metering, building, etc., we have the money to fix the infrastructure first.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnWhelan" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Senator John Whelan</from>
          <p eId="para_200">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is an important part of the consultation process, as he said.  It was initiated by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, last week.  I encourage everyone who has a position on the issue, such as community groups, environmental groups, corporate groups, commercial groups, farming groups and residents associations, to contribute.  A great window of opportunity has been afforded by the Minister of State and his colleagues leading the project, including the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  It is vital that if anyone has a position on this he or she makes it known now or forever holds his or her tongue.  We are at the juncture of making a most important strategic decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I agree with Senator Crown that the importance of the water issue cannot be overstated.  It is second only to the burden of the economic crisis we are facing, which will pass.  The water issue will not if we do not deal with it properly.  It will affect industry, commerce, agriculture and domestic use.  It is the lifeblood of the country and economy.  Over the past ten years we constructed more than 600,000 housing units, not to speak of the advances and development in agriculture and industry.  Huge industries such as Intel and pharmaceutical companies expanded.  It beggars belief that we have not built a reservoir in this country in over 67 years.  It is hard to fathom.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Previous Administrations were hung up on and distracted by vanity projects, such as the Bertie bowl in the middle of nowhere, in order that people could get their names up in lights instead of tackling the basics when we had the resources.  Simple things like fixing leaking pipes and building reservoirs, which I would have thought were a fundamental part of any strategic infrastructure in a developed country, were not done.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Some people within the political apparatus are speaking out of both sides of their mouths on this issue.  They are baying for safe, quality water that is secure and sustainable.  In Galway it cost €40 million of taxpayer's money to resolve the water supply issue after it was contaminated.  At the same time, 440,000 households in the country still rely on septic tanks, most of which function correctly as they are supposed to but many do not.  Let us be honest.  Septic tanks that do not work are polluting the wells, group water schemes and groundwater we all rely on for a safe and sustainable supply.  I cannot understand people speaking out of both sides of their mouths on this issue.  It is about time we restored honesty to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I agree with Senators Daly and Crown that we do not need a costly new quango in this country.  We have enough chief executives.  I use this opportunity to implore the Minister of State, who is a sensible man, to use his influence within the Department before the final decision is made to ensure that we do not set up a costly new apparatus called Irish Water, bord uisce or whatever with a highly paid chief executive, entourage of staff, new office block and consultants holding their hands for the next ten years and telling them what to do but being nowhere to be found when there is a problem.  I agree with the genuine concerns of my colleagues in that regard because it is not the road down which we should go.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">There is a more pragmatic, sensible and common sense solution.  It is about time that we stopped blaming the IMF and troika for the decisions we are making.  We should not apologise for doing the right thing.  It is absurd that we do not have an Irish water utility company.  It should not be something that should have to be forced upon us.  I hope we do not need any more payouts from the troika.  We do not need any more cop-outs.  It is about time we set up a publicly owned Irish water utility that is accountable to the Oireachtas, Department and Minister to do the job properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I agree with Senator Daly that we should learn from the disastrous experience of Northern Ireland Water.  A new company was established from the ground up by people who did not know what they were doing.  They did not have the expertise, tradition, knowledge or grounding in providing the service.  Therefore, at the first sign of a problem it imploded.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I cannot understand what the Green Party did in government for the past five years.  This Government and the Minister, Deputy Hogan, in particular, have mainstreamed the environmental issue and embedded it in policy.  They have done more in the past five months for the environment than the Green Party did in government in five years.  It talked a good game on climate change but did nothing about septic tanks, water security and conservation.  It was more obsessed with the directly elected mayor of Dublin.  Who cares about that?</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I am interested in making sure that the people in the country have safe, clean drinking water and are not worried about it being contaminated.  That is what is important.  It brings me to my core proposal for the Minister of State.  We already have semi-State companies in place with the expertise, skill sets, resources, chief executives and office blocks ready to go.  We do not have to reinvent the wheel in establishing an Irish water utility.  Bord na Móna is the perfect fit for this task.  Others believe the NRA would have a role to play.  I have no problem with that.  Those companies are already in place, have rolled out huge infrastructural projects across the country and have dealt with local communities and authorities in a fair fashion.  This seems to be the kind of task we are talking about in terms of setting up Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Bord na Móna is already in place and is ready to go.  The Government cannot afford to take a punt and see if the new Irish Water company will work or how it pans out.  We do not have the time for that and cannot afford the risks involved with that kind of approach.  Bord na Móna has the proven capability over 75 years of dealing and working with local communities and local authorities across the country.  It has a massive customer base.  I have had my eyes opened and those of others should be as well.  It is a long time since Bord na Móna only dealt in peat.  It has moved, progressed and diversified.  One division alone, AES, which is in the recycling and waste disposal business, dispatches 120,000 bills across the country every month and deals with thousands of customers in regard to flood management.  It is already in the water business and has one of the most well established laboratories in Europe dealing with the question of water testing and water treatment, and already does such work for Intel, Wyeth and Pfizer.  It conducts over 67,000 water tests per year.  In addition, as it has access to the capital markets in Europe and the US, it is in a position to hit the ground running without placing any further financial burden on the Exchequer or the Government at a time when resources are very limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">There is a lot of misinformation and mischief with regard to this issue, and the Minister has touched on this point.  In the past decade, Dublin City Council and other local authorities have been examining alternative sources of water.  Desalination is one of the areas that has been explored and most likely ruled out because it is not feasible and costs ten times more than other options.  I call on those with good intentions who are genuinely concerned about the environmental and ecological issues surrounding abstraction of water from the Shannon to think again.  The Shannon is in flood for 80% of the year.  The proposal from Dublin City Council and Bord na Móna to build a new reservoir at Garryhinch will supply water into the Leinster region for the next 50 years and will only abstract water to the tune of some 2% to 4% on the flood, which is sustainable.  People should stop scaremongering on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I urge my colleagues to be fair-minded about this.  We do not have to go around the houses or to reinvent the wheel.  We already have the expertise and skillset in place within the semi-State sector.  That is the model the Government should embrace and I urge it to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, back to the House.  Senator Whelan said the Minister of State is a very sensible man, with which I agree, but it is not always necessarily the case that sensible Ministers make sensible decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">On the issue of the establishment of a body to deal with water supply and distribution, we would support that in principle.  It is important for all of us across the parties to recognise that water is a scarce resource.  We have to treat water and ensure it is of the highest standard, all of which comes at a cost.  There is a need to ensure we have joined-up approaches across the State.  I happen to live in south Kilkenny but I represent Waterford.  That whole area has been well serviced in recent times because of the huge investment made in the water treatment services in that area.  The progress is disjointed, however, and the same is not the case across the country.  We spend huge amounts of money treating water but the problem, as we know, is that well over half of it is then leaked through the system; therefore, we are treating twice as much as we use.  The argument made by many is that the focus of Government should be to sort out those problems in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">On a small but important point in the context of the establishment of this body, the Irish language is very important and the body should be called Uisce Éireann, not Irish Water.  Logos are important.  We had a discussion in the House last week about the importance of the Irish language.  There is no point paying lip service to the language if we then establish a national body and do not use our national language.  I ask that we would give consideration to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I concur with Senator Whelan that we do not need any more quangos in the State.  I share all of his concerns in terms of setting up a new structure and having a new CEO, a new layer of management, new headquarters and all the costs that go with that.  We need to make sure that is not what this utility becomes.  It has to be about making sure we provide the very best service to people in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I believe strongly the body should be in public ownership and would completely oppose any privatisation of water services in the State.  In the context of today's debate, I would have to express my opposition to water charges, which I know the Government is considering.  People are asking themselves fundamental questions, namely, why are they paying taxes and what are they paying them for?  They are paying more PAYE, more PRSI and more in terms of the universal social charge.  They are paying more in direct taxation and more in indirect taxation, yet they are getting less in terms of services.  People are asking why, on top of all the extra taxes they have been asked to pay in recent years — as the Minister of State knows, the universal social charge has hit families very hard — and all of the cuts they are living with, more taxes are being imposed in the form of stealth taxes such as the household charge, with a property tax to come, the septic tank charge and now water charges.  Surely, when we pay our taxes and pay through our income, we are paying for basic services.  Water should be one of those basic services.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It is important for us to get the detail from the Minister.  When he brings forward the Bill, we will seek to know exactly what the Government is proposing in terms of the composition, the management layers and whether the body will be public or privately run.  I have given the Minister my view and that of my party.  First and foremost, I ask him to address the issue of the name.  Some might see it as a small point but it is very important that we protect our language.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I ask the Minister to take on board the points made by people across the divide today that we do not want any more quangos.  What we want is a body that will deliver the best water services for the people of this State and end the discrimination whereby some people who happen to live in certain areas must suffer.  We saw what happened to water quality in the west and, although this also happened in Waterford and other areas, it seems to be worst in certain areas.  While my area has experienced an improvement, not every area has had the same.  We must make sure, across the country, we are getting the very best water for our people.  If this can be done through a body that can co-ordinate those services across local authorities, I will support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaitKeane" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Senator Cáit Keane</from>
          <p eId="para_219">We all know the importance of water and the requirement to support economic growth.  In Ireland, water is a valuable resource and we have the capacity, if we use it and do not abuse it, to position Ireland well in terms of competitiveness.  We should never lose sight of that.  We all know the €1.2 billion cost of water and ask whether it is being spent in the best possible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I examined the various reports, in particular the independent Mackenzie report on water.  The Minister of State referred to desalination on "The Frontline" in recent days but it was not mentioned in the report and I would like to hear some form of recommendation on that.  I understand the energy required to use desalination has resulted in two different scientific views, one being that it would heat household water for €60 a year.  In Perth, Australia, a desalination plant is being worked from wind farms.  If we look forward to having 100% renewable energy in Ireland, we would be able to use a desalination plant to provide all the water we wanted at night and store the electricity to use later.  I want to examine that side of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Today, we are discussing the setting up of the new water authority.  I recommend it be termed in the Irish language rather than the English language.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">As Senator Mulcahy has spoken on the issue of jobs, I will skip that issue. On administration, the position of the 34 local authorities hinders the development of a co-ordinated approach to the infrastructure. This is one of the main reasons we must consider having a water authority. The quality of water in Ireland is generally high and it would be remiss of me not to compliment the various local authorities which, over the years, have provided us with good quality water. There has been the odd glitch, as in Galway in 2007, a point missed by another Senator. The new septic tank regulation will ensure we have even better quality water.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">As to the setting up of Irish Water, will the Minister of State ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater?  The assessment which has been done shows that the experienced workforce in place knows the assets, is close to the customers and is accountable for quality.  The Minister of State should write accountability to customers into the contract.  In the transfer of waste management, we have seen that accountability to customers is not good.  I would not like to see the same happening with water.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">There are weaknesses in the current system and inconsistencies and variabilities throughout the country.  The economies of scale simply are not there to deliver.  There has been underinvestment but if the business is undertaken in a central manner, there will be more investment.  Local authority boundaries do not reflect the riverine bays and districts that are so integrated in river basin management.  I was a member of a local council when it passed the river basin management plans to upgrade the water system.  Given there are seven river basins in the Republic, three of which are shared with Northern Ireland, will the new water authority work with the North?  The report recommends that the river basin district is the recommended catchment area, rather than the local authority boundary.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">If we look at the international experience as part of this work, and compare, even if only with our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland Water and Scottish Water, operating expenditure in Ireland per connection is more expensive at present, by 50% to 100%.  Collection rates are much poorer for industrial entities.  The number of employees per water connection and per customer are significantly higher than internationally.  We must look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Many speakers have mentioned quangos and I will, too, although I hope not to term this new semi-State water body as such.  Senator Crown mentioned the number of different bureaucracies and I agree with him.  In countries around Europe this is being addressed by amalgamation of municipal water services, the creation of utilities or the use of intercommunal structures.  Creation of larger bodies for the provision of water service, often outside municipal control, is a key trend in most European countries in the past 20 years.   Has the Minister of State considered the intercommunal model, where several municipalities join together and set up a company to which they delegate the provision of water services?  I realise this is not the type proposed by Irish Water but I ask him to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Self-funding is a priority and most of the companies that have been set up in the past five years in other countries have become self-funding.  It is a very attractive option.  Consumption of and charging for water are other points.  I will not blame the IMF, the EU or anybody else for this because it should have been done long ago.  Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not have what is called the "polluter pays" principle.  In Denmark, a reduction of 12.6% in household consumption was achieved when that country introduced charges.  The average consumption per person per day in Denmark now stands at 114 litres, which is roughly 25% lower than consumption here.  That figure refers to a conservatively consuming household.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">We will introduce, in effect, a polluter pays charge when the Minister of State introduces this system, with the free allowance,  However, in the UK, for example, for households with large families or sick members who may use a great deal of water, there is a support service called a water-share tariff.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to that because it is an important part of metering.  A person who is sick uses much more water during an illness than another person.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Senator Feargal Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_229">The Minister of State is most welcome, as are his words, particularly his stated objective to ensure that Irish water is best in class, a term I like a lot.  I recorded an interview for RTE recently and was asked by Fingal authorities what I thought of its water quality.  I said we always drank it and had never had any problem with it.  I live in Howth.  We had to stop because it turned out that sea water was what was intended.  Sewage used to enter at a certain point but does not do so any longer.  I discovered I had not been listening carefully enough to the question.  In any event, the objective of having us as best in class is a worthy one.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I wish to ask the Minister about the recent PricewaterhouseCooper analysis, which was briefly mentioned in the report.  It states that some non-domestic water users may have to pay more in coming years.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on this as it may have a big effect on certain businesses and sectors of industry?  For example, Matt Moran, the director of Pharma Chemical Ireland, represented by IBEC, stated: "Water is a major issue for the bio-tech sector in Ireland both in terms of the quality and affordability of supplies."  It is important.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on these future plans?  We may dissuade certain industrial development from locating here if we put more red tape and costs on such firms.  One of the criticisms of Ireland in the past was the amount of red tape involved.  We are working very well on this in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">We must also remember smaller businesses.  Water has been part of the success stories of a number of businesses in Ireland.  For example, I have seen the advertisements on television sponsored by AIB for Celtic Pure, a Monaghan company which started selling drums of water door to door.  Last year, the company's workforce grew by about one third to 32, and it now wants to expand to mainland Europe.  How can we ensure that both large and small businesses are being protected properly, particularly those that rely on water?</p>
          <p eId="para_232">A related note, also in the report, pointed out that the collection rate of money due by non-domestic users is 52%.  This was described as particularly low by international standards.  From a business perspective, I struggle to understand why the collection rate is so low.  Would the Minister of State be better served by making the collection of these amounts a priority, in whatever way he can manage to achieve that?</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I am also concerned about the six weeks' consultation process.  There is a risk that the legislation will be rushed through the Oireachtas.  It has been highlighted on the blog, <i>irisheconomy.ie</i>, that there are gaps in the PWC report.  For example, the report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_234">For the Public Utility Model a high level assessment was undertaken in relation to what the financial position of the business might be and in particular the likely funding requirements, based on a number of assumptions made and sensitivities chosen.  Given the commercially sensitive nature of aspects of this assessment, some of the specific assumptions and the detailed findings have been redacted from this section of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I quote that because it is a concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I have a final comment on Senator Cullinane's point about the name "Uisce" being used, rather than "Irish Water".  I was involved in An Bord Phoist many years ago when we had to come up with a new name for the new service.  We decided on "An Post".  The Minister at the time asked what it would be called in English.  I told him there was no need for a translation because certain words are understood so easily.  If "post" is understood in both languages there is no need for an English translation.  "Uisce" is certainly understood by everybody in Ireland.  Let us see if we can make this little gesture towards the Irish language by ensuring that rather than call the entity "Irish Water" we find a different term.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisLandy" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Senator Denis Landy</from>
          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In athletics parlance, this is his third day of training on this issue.  He had a good run out on Monday night and a better one at the committee yesterday.  Today is the day when spectators look in.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I have just a few points to make.  There was a good debate on the issue yesterday, with a good exchange of views.  No more than the Minister of State, I have thought some more about the matter.  First, it is extremely important that the organisations that represent local government, in other words the practitioners, are included in the consultation process.  The Minister of State was a councillor for many years.   There are three associations, AMAI, LAMA and the ACC.  If these have not been included on the list in regard to a request for consultation they should be added and should get a hearing at some level.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Senator Daly and other Senators referred to what actually happens on the ground in the provision of these services.  Nothing happens when everything works well but when it does not, as the Minister of State will know from his previous life as a councillor, as do I and the Chairman, the telephone starts to ring and answers are required from the elected representatives.  If we do not have somebody we can ring, we are in trouble. For example, if there is a water leak anywhere in County Tipperary, within 20 minutes, the 26 members of South Tipperary County Council will receive a text message from the senior engineer telling them how long the water supply will be cut off for and that is of phenomenal benefit to them, particularly in their electoral areas. While as a Senator, I do not technically have a constituency under the Constitution, Tipperary South is my constituency and it is important that I have access to that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">There are optimistic and pessimistic views about what the Minister is trying to do.  The optimistic view is that little will change; staff will transfer from local authorities to Irish Water; the Government will meet the IMF requirements regarding the establishing of the body and metering; efficiencies will be achieved in the service; nobody will charged for the installation of the meters; and leaks in the system will be fixed quicker because it will be more efficient.  On the other hand, the pessimistic view is that Irish Water will be another quango; connectivity with communities will be lost; there will be no accountability; lip service will be paid customers via the freefone service; leaks will not be repaired the way they used to be; and local councillors, Deputies and, even the Minister of State in County Louth, will be unable to check what is the problem and have it resolved.  I do not subscribe to either view.  Neither view is exclusively shared by Government Members, on the one hand, and Opposition Members, on the other, as has been witnessed in the debate thus far because there is a mix of views on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I have a number of questions, some of which the Minister of State addressed yesterday.  He did not have an opportunity to address the remainder and, therefore, I will put them again.  What choice will the 4,200 staff in the system have?  If they decide that they do not want to transfer to the new company, what will remain for them?  The Minister of State referred to the river basin model as the way forward for this system.  However, it will not assimilate into the regional authority model, which currently has river basin management committees that mean nothing.  The Acting Chairman may have served on such a committee during his career but they mean nothing because they have no statutory power.  They are in place only to be consulted and advised about what is going on and, therefore, they are useless bodies.  The regional authorities have little power either but, at least, they are part of a recognised structure and there are eight in place around the country.  If the Government is considering a regional structure for water services, it should examine the regional authority model.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The Minister stated at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht that the new body would be accountable by way of parliamentary questions and requests to attend committees to the Oireachtas.  I am not satisfied with that.  The new company should be accountable to local government.  I am not naive enough to believe that the body has to be hands on but it has to be put on a statutory footing and it must be required to respond to requests regarding leaks, breakages and services that are needed from local government on a structured basis.  If that is the only measure the Minister of State takes on board from this consultation, he will make me happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Councillors are elected locally.  Waste management and health functions have been taken from them in recent years.  HSE committees have been established and they also have no statutory powers.  The State has privatised much of the local authority housing stock and people are beginning to ask why they should stand for local government or become part of the local government process.  Regional planning guidelines outline how a region should be developed.  Local authority members must adhere to them but their views on them must be listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">One of the Minister of State's officials stated yesterday it would cost substantially less than €1 billion to install the meters.  If it costs, say, €500,000, how long will it take to get a return on the investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_245">If we forget about setting up a new quango or structure, the Minister of State should go with Senator Whelan's suggestion to give the responsibility for water services to an existing organisation such as Bord na Mona — he is a little biased because he is based in the midlands — or to pick the brains of the existing 4,200 staff who have the most knowledge, expertise in water services and transfer them into a new overarching body.  He would not need to seek new staff, as they are available through the service he oversees currently.  I agree with Senator Cullinane's point about quangos and additional money.  We do not need it because the expertise is available.  The body should be drawn from the current staff.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_246">I wish to share time with Senator Norris.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I welcome the Minister of State. His debate in Irish with Senator Ó Clochartaigh and others has gone into the annals of the House, on which I compliment him. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stated when he examined these issues when he served in the Department of the Environment, he found engineers much more interested in building and designing new dams than in fixing leaks. According to the McLoughlin report, the leakage rate is between 17% and 50%, depending on the local authority area. I was disappointed when Senator Quinn pointed out that a section of the report dealing with this was redacted. We experienced the same problem with a report on VHI in regard to health insurance. There should be no redactions where Oireachtas Members are concerned. We have to make vital decisions and we should have access to complete reports. I hope the Minister of State can use his influence with the Department of Health and others to ensure elected representatives have the full information. The word "redaction" should be removed from our vocabulary.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">My other fear is that the reforms slated for the Department and local authorities in the McLoughlin report could be put to one side because the Government is too busy investing new forms of taxation such as the septic tank and water taxes and the household and site charges. The report found that there was a surplus of ten county managers, 50 directors of services, 220 corporate staff, 225 senior and middle management, 62 human resources, 1,000 staff in Dublin and Cork city councils, 180 professional, senior and middle management, 250 in roads sections and 171 in planning departments. Mr. Owen Keegan, county manager of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown local authority, estimates that there are 1,800 surplus staff. Both Mr. McLoughlin and Mr. Keegan presented papers on this in Kenmare, County Kerry, the year before last. That problem has to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Mr. Keegan also stated on "Morning Ireland" the week before last that he found the Croke Park agreement an impediment to his attempt to meet the targets in the McLoughlin report.  While the total number of local authority staff is 4,200 now, I do not know what the number should be and how many of the surplus posts relate to water services.  As Senator Landy said, many other local authority functions have been transferred elsewhere.  However, we need to examine the cost base of local authorities to make sure that the efficiencies that should have been generated since the report was published are being generated.  It has been reported that the two local authorities in County Tipperary will be amalgamated, as will the both councils in County Limerick but is that radical enough?</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I agree with previous speakers who are worried that Irish Water will be another quango.  Both Government parties committed in their election manifestos to reducing the number of quangos.  Can the new body be staffed from the slimmed down local authority workforce, which, as other Senators said, has the expertise in this area?  We do not want a break in concentration away from the McLoughlin agenda where a new quango is set up with an expanded public relations department, thereby creating other problems.  The expertise that is available should be used while slimming down the local authority structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The new body should have no budget and it should finance itself from the savings identified in the McLoughlin report, which are required from local government.  Perhaps, even a dividend to the Department could be generated to be used for other purposes.  I would not like the Seanad to wave a green flag regarding another quango, which could go out of control with large public relations and human resources departments duplicating what is in place in local authorities.  The number of staff in the HSE doubled between the previous recession in the 1980s from 55,000 to 110,000 at peak in the late 2000s.  We are experiencing how difficult it is to reduce the numbers to the previous level and it is difficult to recognise improvements in services in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I would like the Minister of State to make sure that not many of his staff are devoted to finding new forms of taxation because that aspect of the IMF agreement has not received sufficient attention.  Current expenditure between now and 2015 will be approximately the same but provision is made for an additional €10 billion in taxation, including the various charges that will be applied by the Department.  The emphasis should have been on why this is needed because that will create problems in reviving the productive capacity of the economy.  Water has a significant role to contribute and I hope the Minister of State will first examine the local authorities which, according to the McLoughlin report, manage to lose up to 50% of the water they are supposed to supply.  That is unacceptable and charging people to drink water or to have a bath when 50% of the supply never gets to the house would be a misapplication of resources and I ask the Minister of State to apply his energies to correcting that.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Senator David Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_253">I thank Senator Barrett for sharing time.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the Bill which has three main proposals, including the creation of a new utility.  I hope there is no intention to sell it off down the road, similar to what happened in Britain.  However,  it is unlikely.  I have no difficulty with a water charge.  It is a question of the consumer paying, not the polluter, and it is interesting that, as the Minister of State pointed out, we are unique in Europe in not having such a charge.  I have a small place up the mountains in a remote agricultural village in Cyprus.  I have been metered since I bought the house ten years ago.  I have no difficulty paying because I pay for what I use.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">It is important that metering be installed.  The process will take time and it will be costly but the State will recover the cost via the water charge.  However, it must be ensured the meters are accessible, particularly for people such as me who live on their own.  I am not often there when staff from the other utility companies such as the ESB or Bord Gais call and it is a complete nuisance to have to use estimates and so on.  Can care be exercised in the placement of the meters in order that they can be visible without access to the house?  They should be discreetly installed on a wall outside.  I wonder whether it is possible to link them to a centralised computer in this era of technology in order that they can be read directly.  The technology is available and it should be done now.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explore that in order that there will be a centralised collection of information and if there is a need to check the meter, the householder can do so if it is accessible to ensure the bill is accurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I have always found it astonishing that in a climate such as this, we suffer from water shortages because we are regularly drenched with rain.  We are lucky to live in such a temperate climate and there is no excuse for such shortages.  The leakage rate was referred to by Senator Barrett and I raised this on a number of occasions during previous Seanaid.  The lowest rate is 17% but one local authority has a leakage rate of 50%.  That is because the infrastructure has not been renewed and I hope the new central authority will look after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I agree with Senator Landy regarding the changeover of staff.  Local authorities have expertise and he spoke effectively about the way the engineer gets in touch with local representatives.  That is a good indicator of a community service that looks after the community.  I hope a scenario will not develop where moving money will be paid where staff continue to do the same work but the unions negotiate disturbance money or a promotion.  I am a good union man but that would be counterproductive.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Senator David Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_258">That is ridiculous.  I hope that it will be avoided in this case and I will support the Minister in fighting that should it come around.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It is astonishing that more than 50% of the money due from businesses is not collected.  Some of the heaviest users of waters are in the distilling industry.  They use massive volumes of water in the distillation of whiskey and if they are among those who do not pay, there is no excuse because they are part of multinational operations and they are successful.  Jameson used to be an Irish company and it is the fastest growing whiskey brand in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It is the responsibility of government to make sure water is drinkable.  To have had non-potable water in a city such as Galway is appalling and it is damaging for the tourism trade.  It was not fair on the citizens who had to buy significant volumes of imported bottled water in the past two years.  That is wrong and it had an impact on the tourism trade.  If there are breaks in the water supply, hotels, guesthouses and farm houses that take guests are seriously affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Whiskey translates as uisce beatha.  We have uisce and everybody knows whiskey.  I would be happy if the new board was called Uisce.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_262">I welcome the Minister of State.  When I was Lord Mayor of Cork a number of years ago, I had to take a trip to Kenya.  I visited a hospital 125 miles south of Nairobi, which did not have a water supply.  The only water staff had to use was collected from the hospital roof during the two weeks of the year it rained, which was pumped into ten 50,000 litre tanks.  That was the hospital's water supply for the remaining 11 and a half months of the year.  When one visits such a place, one appreciates how much water we waste.  The hospital was still able to undertake 2,500 operations a year in those conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I support Senator Whelan's proposal.  It should be examined whether it is feasible to use existing organisations to provide this service rather than setting up a new structure.  If savings could be made, this should be considered.  It should not be ignored, especially given the NRA has the expertise and it is only a question of bringing in additional staff to deal with this new responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">In 2010, the State spent €1.2 billion supplying water, of which €500 million was allocated to capital investment.  Over the previous ten years, more than €5 billion was spent on the water services capital programme.  That is a considerable amount of money.  We must be economical in terms of continuing to provide a good service while achieving value for money.  My colleagues have referred to the savings that have been made in other countries.  The Scottish water authority achieved savings of over 40% in real terms through the establishment of a single, centralised body.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">It amazed me during last year's cold weather that when people went to turn off water supplies to their houses they found the stopcocks were buried in concrete or tarmacadam because of road resurfacing.  One of the things I noticed in Brussels, where I lived for two years, was that I had to shut off the central valve for the water supply to my apartment when I left it on a Thursday evening.  All that is needed to waste a significant amount of water in our schools is to leave two or three toilets dripping over a weekend.  It should not be a case of going outside to find a stopcock.  Why can we not introduce regulations requiring every property built from now own to have installed an internal valve to control water supply so that people can disconnect the water if they go away for a weekend or a week?</p>
          <p eId="para_266">My colleague, Senator Keane, noted that usage decreased when metering was introduced in the UK, Northern Ireland and Denmark.  When water metering was introduced for commercial premises in Cork city, a jeweller's shop which employed two people discovered that it was using 4,500 litres of water per day either due to leaks or because it supplied other buildings.  Metering will identify where water is wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">We should also consider other mechanisms, such as the aforementioned internal stopcocks, to help people prevent water wastage.  I refer in particular to office buildings, schools and public buildings which do not need water during weekends or holiday periods.  We should consider new regulations in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I welcome the proposal to centralise the system.  I have received complaints from local authority employees who work on the ground to repair sewerage systems and water lines about the mobility of engineers within departments.  One workman told me that an engineer never remained in charge of a particular area for longer than 12 months, with the result that those who did the manual work had to provide the expertise.  The establishment of a central authority will allow for continuity of staff.  Local knowledge is extremely important.  When we establish the water authority we should get the best value and the best service possible.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael Comiskey</from>
          <p eId="para_269">I have a special interest in this area because I operate a small business which employs approximately 15 people to install mains and metering.  Senator Mulcahy touched on an issue close to our hearts.  When one sets up a company it is important to vet anybody coming from outside.  I refer to the problems that arose in the Border counties where Northern Ireland contractors hired sub-contractors before moving out of the jurisdiction and leaving behind huge bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I also welcome the scheme introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to encourage farmers to harvest water for washing machines and milking parlours.  There is no point in using treated water for that sort of on-farm work.  The scheme will also create jobs.  I know an individual who is in the business of going to marts and farmers' yards to sell tanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">What will happen to companies like Veolia water, which is working with Sligo and Leitrim county councils?  They may have entered into contracts with local authorities for periods of up to 20 years.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_273">This important debate is only the commencement of our deliberations on water services.  The legislation is not being rushed and the full details will probably not be finalised until next year.  That is not to say, however, that Irish Water will not be established before the summer.  We will need time to draw up legislation providing for its powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Senators have raised a variety of issues and if I fail to address any points they can raise them again.  I would be happy to return to the Seanad whenever it is appropriate to give this issue as much time as it needs, to ensure the messages Senators send are heeded and to return with the answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I support those who believe we should have an ainm as Gaeilge.  Uisce is fabulous.  There was a company in Kerry called Fíoruisce Ciarraí— I knew the individual who ran it — but it has since gone out of business.  We cannot call it "uisce beatha" even if whatever amount of uisce Senator Norris desires will be perfectly dilute.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">One of the key issues that Senators raised pertained to staff.  While it will ultimately be a matter for Irish Water to determine the staffing and skills required for the new organisation, it is likely that the numbers will be lower than those deployed today.  These reductions will be achieved over the period to 2018 in a managed way by designing a fit-for-purpose model, eliminating existing duplication of activities, deriving synergies and efficiencies from the delivery of a national service and leveraging technology.  These are key issues to address in developing the implementation plan, which will involve close co-operation with local authorities, staff and unions to ensure the change is well managed, taking into account the age profile of staff in the sector and wider local government staffing needs.  In the initial phase, Irish Water will largely work through service level agreements with local authorities to ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against loss of local expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We engaged with ICTU at the outset of the independent assessment and my Department has written to that organisation about further discussions as part of the consultation process which commenced on 16 January.  From a staffing perspective, Irish Water will be able to offer opportunities not otherwise available to those who wish to pursue careers in water services.  Increased specialisation will provide routes for career development.  As Irish Water will be a public body, considerable protection will be provided by law for staff transferring to it from local authorities.  The transition of staff from local authorities to the water utility will involve, as I said, full discussions with staff and unions. That is a key point.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The question about quangos is important, because a few years ago we had so many quangos one could not count them.  We are in the business of reducing quangos.  First, existing State companies, a number of which have expressed interest, are being seriously considered.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and NewERA are meeting with these bodies to identify how they would do the job if they got it and the criteria that would apply.  The intention is most certainly to examine the possibility that the water company will be an amalgamation of existing local authority staff and will include, as many people here have mentioned, an existing organisation.  This is what we all want.  However, if it is Bord na Móna or the ESB, we must be careful to ensure the new entity is separated from the mothership, as we could call it.  The water company would have to be totally separate from its parent company and all of its borrowing requirements and so on would need to be separated.  Then there are all sorts of other issues to do with human resources and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">What we are talking about is a new body which will achieve, specifically, more coherent and integrated organisational structures, consistent and transparent service quality and rapid deployment of resources to a national consumer service centre with a regional and local presence.  That is important, as I said earlier.  This is about accountability, nationally, locally and regionally.  If there is a problem locally, one can pick up the phone, dial a 1890 number or whatever, and be provided with the answer.  There must be total accountability.  That is terribly important.  There will be a more efficient cost base, lower unit cost of delivery, elimination of duplication and the garnish of advantages due to economies of scale.  As I said, in parallel with the consultation process, a detailed review of the State agencies is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I mentioned — some Members came in after I had said it — that the water company would need to have due regard to the plans of local and regional authorities.  In other words, it cannot decide without consultation.  Senator Landy made a good point: how will the company report back in order that we know what is going on?  We cannot have the water company turning up at every meeting of county councils and other bodies.  Accountability on a customer basis is required.  We must work out a transparent, accountable system, so that local authority members have access to the answers they need about their county.  There must be two-way messages all the time.  Regional authorities have an important function as well, because we are talking about plans based on river basins.  We will consider all these points and return to the Senators before actual decisions are made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The issue of the Border counties is an important one.  Who will get the contracts and how will we invigilate them?  For example, I might have a contract for 5,000 houses and decide to employ Johnny Murphy's contractors to do the job.  That is a key issue.  Given that this contract will be so important, we will have to make sure we have independent hands-on assessment of where the work is going on, how it is going on, and the capacity of companies to deliver.  I presume that if a company is using contractors, accountability will revert to whoever gets the contract.  All of these issues will have to be dealt with fully and satisfactorily and there will be no cowboys doing the job.  That is the bottom line.  We cannot have that, whether north, south, east or west.  It is important that the work done meets all the required standards and that those doing it are properly qualified to do the job.  There will be significant supervision — not day-to-day, but overall contract supervision — by people who are qualified and know what they are doing.  They will make sure, if there are problems, that they are dealt with completely.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Unaccounted-for water is a serious issue.  Something like 41% of all water is unaccounted for.  This does not necessarily mean it is wasted because, as I discovered, some unaccounted-for water is used in illegal connections that people do not officially know about.  This is happening in different parts of the country.  I do not know the amount that is diverted in this way but I know it is there.  We have 25,000 km of piping around the country.  Where there are leaks, we must ensure, as part of the plan, that local authorities have a plan for dealing with unaccounted-for water.  It has been significantly addressed in the Dublin region: unaccounted-for water is down to about 28% in the greater Dublin area now, which is very good.  I have been told it would be difficult economically to achieve a figure of less than 25%.  This is an average international figure and represents good practice, although not best practice.  One can find countries — I will not name them, but they are in the Middle East — that have a figure for unaccounted water of zero, but we do not believe those figures.  At the same time as improving our resources, we must ensure we are not treating twice the volume we need.  This requires hands-on work.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">An analysis has been carried out of why the collection rate for charges from non-domestic water users is around 52%.  There are legacy issues involved; in other words, the bills owed this month in a particular county include unpaid amounts from companies that may have gone out of business.  We need to get to the bottom of this.  In addition, a significant amount of the uncollected moneys are owed by group water schemes and so on which have not paid for some time.  All of these issues must be addressed.  Another problem is that water in County Kildare costs about €1.32 per cubic metre, while the cost in County Wicklow, which adjoins it, is at least double that.  Why do we have different charges in different counties?  In the context of the new utility, there are strong arguments in favour of one national charge, as is the case for the ESB.  There is also an argument, which some people made in today's newspaper, for regional water charges.  We will come back to that issue.  If there was a higher regional charge for electricity in the west, where so many more pylons must be erected, than in Dublin city, I do not think people would be too happy.  There is a good argument to be made for everyone to share the pain nationally.  We all go forward together with the plans, and if Cork benefits from my money, why should it not, if it gets the infrastructure it needs?</p>
          <p eId="para_284">One of the key points made was about the cost of local government.  Since 2008, the number of people who have left local government across all sectors is 7,500.  The amount of money that has been saved is about €350 million; that is the benefit in terms of the wages that do not have to be paid.  However, the 7,500 represent 30% of the total workforce that have left the public sector, even though local authority employment makes up only 10% of total employment across the public sector.  There have been significant efficiencies in local government, but there has been a considerable reduction in staff compared to the public sector as a whole.  That is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">If there are other issues that Members want to raise with me later, I will be happy to deal with them.  I thank Senators for their time and for the points they made.  To return to the main point, this is consultation.  We are listening, and after consultation we will make decisions.  We will come back to the Seanad at that stage.  We need all the advice and help we can get, and we will take into consideration the points made by everyone, from whatever political party or none.  What is best for the country is to move forward under Uisce Éireann, or whatever we are going to call it.  Tiocfaidh an t-uisce, agus beidh an tír níos fearr as.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the Second Stage of the Education (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Before I turn to a detailed explanation of the provisions of the Bill, I will explain its background.  As Senators may be aware, a previous edition of this Bill, the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 was brought before the Dáil in October 2010 by my predecessor, Mary Coughlan.  That Bill never passed Committee Stage and so never received attention from the 23rd Seanad.  Upon becoming Minister for Education and Skills last March, I asked my Department to set about resurrecting that legislation with some changes.  The Bill before the House thus carries on the most of the technical, housekeeping parts of the 2010 Bill, but also reflects the changed priorities of the current Government for our education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Perhaps the biggest change to the Bill before the House is that it no longer provides for the involvement of vocational education committees in the provision of primary education.  As an Opposition Deputy in 2010, I was of the view that the manner in which the Department of Education and Skills introduced a new pilot form of community national school at primary level, while welcome, should only have been done following consideration of the matter by a forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary school sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">One of my first acts as Minister for Education and Skills was to establish that forum and I expect that its final report and recommendations will be published shortly.  However, the House may be aware that the advisory group to the forum on patronage presented its initial reflections last November and indicated that it is broadly supportive of the continuation of the community national school model.  As a result, I believe it will be necessary to provide this patronage model with a statutory footing in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Separately, I have also commenced a major reform of the vocational education committees.  My intention is to reduce the number of VEC committees from 33 to 16 and to reform them into what they actually are — local education and training boards.  This reform will require separate legislation and provides an opportunity for the Oireachtas to pass one consolidated Bill dealing with every aspect of VEC education to replace nine VEC Bills and a host of statutory instruments.  That will be a more appropriate place in which to put, on a statutory footing, the arrangements for the establishment and running of primary schools by the successors to VECs.  It is the Government's intention to make progress in this regard before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The Education Amendment Bill 2012 provides for the amendment of the Education Act 1998 and the amendment of the Teaching Council Act 2001 in a number of education matters.  These include: clarification on the delivery of speech therapy services to students; the abolition of the educational disadvantage committee; revised procedures for the appointment, suspension, dismissal and remuneration of teachers and other staff; arrangements for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001; and provision for the Teaching Council to make regulations to apply certain conditions to the renewal of registration of teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Bill also provides for the repeal of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act 1997 and the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Act 1998.  These are all matters that require to be dealt with in primary legislation and I am pleased to be able to begin that process today.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Sections 1 to 3 of the Bill contain the standard provisions for the Short Title and collective citations, interpretation and expenses.  Section 4 provides for three amendments to definitions contained in section 2(1) of the Education Act 1998.  The definition of "educational disadvantage" is amended in section 4(<i>a</i>) as a result of the repeal of section 32 of the Education Act 1998 which is provided for in section 7 of the Bill.  This section also provides for the substitution of the definition of “principal” to take account of the changes to appointment procedures proposed within this Bill.  Section 4 also provides for the amendment of the definition of “support services” in section 7 of the Education Act 1998 in order to clarify the position on delivery of speech therapy services and other health and personal services to students of schoolgoing age.  The Education Act 1998 lists the planning and co-ordination of support services, including speech therapy services, as a function of the Minister for Education and Science.  While there is agreement at policy level that the HSE will continue to provide such services, the proposed amendments of the Education Act 1998 are necessary to clarify the position of the delivery of speech therapy services to students of schoolgoing age.  The legislative framework will be regularised in accordance with the <i>de facto</i> position, which is that the provision of speech therapy services is a matter for the HSE.  This position is already acknowledged by the Oireachtas through the provision of voted moneys to the HSE to deliver such services.  The HSE provides health supports, including speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, for children.  In some instances such therapy services are delivered in schools and the proposed amendment will not change the existing position.  The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs through the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">The Department's commitment to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs is not diminished.  The Department will continue to work with its partners in the health and disability sectors through the vehicle of the cross-sectoral team established under the auspices of the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health and the national disability strategy stakeholder monitoring group.  This provision gives rise to a consequential technical amendment to repeal sections 7(5) and 7(6) of the 1998 Act, as inserted by section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.  This is provided for in section 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Section 6 provides for a revised text of sections 23 and 24 of the Education Act 1998 which provided for the appointment, suspension, dismissal and payment of teachers, including principal teachers and other staff, in accordance with procedures put in place by the Minister following agreement with the education partners.  By requiring agreement as distinct from consultation in respect of appointment, suspension and dismissal matters affecting teachers the existing legislation creates a significant obstacle to change.  The Department's well established approach of consulting and, wherever possible, securing agreement with stakeholders for change will continue to be used and existing mechanisms will not be displaced.  However, there are existing agreements on the suspension and dismissal of teachers that will continue to apply.  It is necessary to retain a power to be used as an emergency measure where, despite our best efforts, agreement cannot be reached to ensure that change can be effected in the public interest.  This is provided for by the new section 24(3).</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The new section 24(5) of the Education Act provides for the redeployment of teachers and other school staff in accordance with redeployment procedures determined by the Minister of the day with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform following consultation with stakeholders.  A person redeployed under these procedures will become an employee of the board of management or VEC to which he or she has been redeployed.  While having fully efficient and effective teacher redeployment arrangements has always been an objective of the Department, it has assumed a critical dimension in the context of the EU-IMF framework.  This is because of the ceiling on numbers under the employment control framework, ECF, and the imperative of staying within that limit.  We also have obligations under the Croke Park agreement on redeployment.  As with disciplinary matters, my policy is to reach agreement on redeployment matters.  The power to determine should be an instrument of last resort.  Ultimately, however, I need a measure that enables me to ensure that redeployment is not delayed or prevented in general or individual cases.  The new provisions can make a positive contribution to ensuring that agreements can be reached with managers and patrons.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">This section also makes provision for the employment, in certain exceptional and limited circumstances, of persons who are not registered teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Since the economic crisis began employment for teachers has become increasingly difficult because of recruitment embargoes and changes to pupil-teacher ratios.  This is especially the case for young teachers who have just graduated from teacher training colleges and who cannot secure full-time work.  Last Easter, I spoke at the INTO annual conference in Sligo and I noted the concerns of many young teachers who took the view that retired or unqualified teachers were being recruited ahead of them.  There is a widespread belief that this makes it harder for teachers, especially young teachers, to gain the necessary experience and that it contributes to high unemployment rates among newly qualified teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Unlike the last Government, I listened to these concerns and reflected on them carefully.  Last May, I announced new rules to ensure schools employ only appropriately qualified and registered teachers.  For the first time, the Department has set out tight restrictions on the singularly limited circumstances in which it may be necessary to engage an unregistered person where otherwise a school would have to close or send pupils home.  The new restrictions strike a balance between the interests of students, giving newly qualified unemployed teachers employment opportunities and meeting the short-term staffing needs of individual schools.  The changes I have made will ensure that this happens and that there will be transparency for the school management and the Department to verify it.  In this context, section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001, which has not yet been commenced, provides that only registered teachers can be remunerated out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Rather than amending section 30 of the Teaching Council Act which provides for the requirement for publicly paid teachers to be registered, this provision has been included in section 24 of the Education Act 1998 instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Section 24 of the 1998 Act deals with employment matters relating to teachers and is accordingly a more appropriate <i>locus</i> for this provision.  While it remains my aim that all teachers in schools be registered with the council and therefore fully qualified, it is apparent that to commence section 30 as it stands would have a serious negative impact for a small number of schools in which, in specific circumstances, unqualified personnel are required in the short term.  I doubt that anyone wishes to bring about a situation where legislation is overly cumbersome and forces schools to close unnecessarily.  This situation may arise where, for example, a teacher falls ill in a small rural school and no registered teacher is available at short notice.  In such a case provision must be made for the payment of the person acting in lieu of a teacher for a restricted period to prevent closure at little or no notice with the associated disruption for pupils and parents, especially since in many cases both parents are working outside the home.  I emphasise that a balance must be struck between the interests of students, giving newly qualified unemployed teachers employment opportunities and meeting the short-term staffing needs of individual schools.  The circular published last May and the changes contained in the Bill achieve this aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">To date the use of unqualified personnel has been unregulated.  The proposed amendment to the Education Act 1998 is necessary to allow the Minister for Education and Skills to regulate for the first time and in a measured way the use of unregistered personnel in exceptional and limited circumstances.  The overarching aim of protecting the standards of education for students remains and the impact of this amendment is to strike a balance between the rights of students to be taught by registered teachers and the need for individual schools to deal with short-term difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The move to mandatory registration of teachers will be an important factor in progressively ensuring a fully-qualified and registered teaching cohort.  However, the reality facing schools is that it is not always possible to engage a registered teacher, especially at short notice.  This may be because of geographical reasons or the lack of availability of teachers of particular subjects at a given time.  This reality exists despite the maintenance of a high level of output of graduates and it is important that provision is made for the exceptional and limited circumstances in which the use of unregistered people may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Section 7 provides for the repeal of section 32 of the Education Act 1998 and thereby abolishes the educational disadvantage committee.  That committee concluded its work in 2005 and is no longer required since the establishment of DEIS.  The abolition of the committee was included in the budget of 2009 as a measure for the rationalisation of agencies.  The absence of the EDC has not adversely impacted upon the Department's commitment to ongoing consultation on educational disadvantage and the wider social inclusion agenda.  The implementation and evaluation of DEIS has been continuously supported by ongoing consultation with education partners and stakeholders.  I should emphasise that educational disadvantage remains a priority for both the Government and the Department and we will continue to provide a structured and targeted approach to dealing with educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Section 8 provides for a procedural amendment of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to cross reference the amendment of section 24 of the Education Act 1998 as provided for in section 6 of the Bill and as outlined earlier.  Section 30 of the 2001 Act has not yet been commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Section 9 provides for the amendment of section 33 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 to allow the Teaching Council to apply some level of conditionality on renewal of registration by teachers.  This is an important development.  As it stands, section 33 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 requires only that a registered teacher pay the requisite annual fee in order to maintain registration status.  However, it is desirable to make provision for certain conditions to be fulfilled by registered teachers in order to renew their annual registration.  The amendment to section 33 will allow the Teaching Council to make regulations to impose such conditions.  Apart from conditions such as the form and manner in which an application for renewal is made and the documentary and other evidence required to be submitted with the application, the council may apply conditions such as the completion of programmes of continuing education and training and evidence of character, such as Garda clearance and teaching experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">This amendment therefore provides for progression to a more robustly regulated profession and the furtherance of the objective of maintaining and improving teaching standards.  As many Members of the Houses will be aware, such qualitative conditions are already the norm in other professions, and there is no reason the teaching profession should be any different.  This amendment is an enabling one and before the council can make any such regulations, my consent, as Minister for Education and Skills, will be required.  Should the Council propose regulations, they would be considered by my Department in light of their potential benefit to the education system, the burden that would be placed on individual teachers and resource implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Section 10 provides for the amendment of section 38 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 in order to clarify a function of the Teaching Council with regard to programmes of teacher education and training provided by institutions of higher education and training.  Currently, section 38(<i>a</i>) states that “the Council shall, from time to time, (<i>a</i>) review and accredit programmes of teacher education and training”.  This may be interpreted as requiring the council to accredit all of the programmes which it reviews.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Bill contains a provision to allow the council to accredit programmes where it is appropriate to do so.  The council reviews new programmes which are presented to it for first accreditation as well as existing programmes.  A number of reviews of existing programmes have taken place.In all cases, the council has produced detailed reports, which include a number of recommendations aimed at improving the programmes of study in question.  These have been accepted and are being acted upon by the providers in question.  However, should the council determine that either a new programme or an existing one is not up to the high standard that is required of an initial teacher education programme, I want there to be no doubt that the council has the authority not to provide accreditation for that programme if that is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Section 11 provides for the repeal of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act 1997 and the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Act 1998 as the fund has now been fully spent and the provisions of the Acts are no longer required.  The Acts are being repealed in order to end the requirement for the production of annual reports and accounts for a fund which is now defunct.  The Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act 1997 made financial resources available for the provision of education and vocational training in the fields of science and technology through a scientific and technological education investment fund.  The fund was disbursed by the Department of Education and Skills over the years 1998 to 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I look forward to listening to the views of Senators and further debate as the Bill progresses through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AverilPower" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Senator Averil Power</from>
          <p eId="para_309">I appreciate that much of the Bill before us is based on the Education (Amendment) Bill 2010.  Certain aspects of the Bill are necessary and are welcome, particularly the areas relating to conditions for registration, reregistration, for giving the Teaching Council the powers it needs to ensure that pre-service is up to scratch and for addressing the deficit of which we are all aware and which we have discussed in the House on many occasions.  The Bill will also embed a culture of continual improvement and ensure that people will take up all the opportunities available to keep their skills up to date and embrace new technologies throughout their careers.  Other areas of the Bill make largely technical amendments, for example, the change in respect of the educational disadvantage committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I have concerns about some provisions of the Bill, although some of these may just require further clarification.  The Bill was only published last week and we are discussing it today.  It is good to get the opportunity to get more clarity on the issues and concerns both I and some of the education partners have.  I hope the Minister can tell me there is no basis for our concerns and that they only arise due to lack of consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">On the provision related to unqualified teachers, I was disappointed to see this included.  I appreciate there was a problem in the past, particularly in recent years, when extra resources were being put into schools and, due to the large numbers of permanent teachers being appointed, difficulties arose with acquiring trained substitutes.  However, I am not convinced this is still an issue.  If ever there was a time to implement section 30 of the Education Act, this is it.  The Minister said that this applies to exceptional cases, like small schools here and there.  I hope that when a teacher in one of those schools rings in at short notice, the children will be dispersed among the other classes in the school and that this will happen for a one or two-day absence.  The children would be better off in that case than having somebody who is not a trained teacher come in to them.  That time could then be used to find a qualified teacher.  I have no doubt a qualified teacher could be found since we have so many young, trained primary teachers looking for employment.  If a teacher does not turn up on Monday morning, I am sure a qualified teacher could be found for Tuesday, even if that person had to drive 50 or 60 miles to get there.  I hope the Minister reviews this aspect of the Bill and fulfils his recent commitment to bring in section 30 unamended.  I urge him to rethink this provision as it is not necessary in the current environment.  It is regrettable in the current context that he is providing statutory recognition, for the first time, to unqualified personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">If there is an area where restrictions are needed, it relates to the use of retired teachers.  I would rather see a retired teacher in the classroom than someone who is unqualified.  However, there has been far too much recourse to rehiring retired teachers rather than hiring young teachers who are unemployed.  Retired teachers have their pensions.  The data in this regard are not clear, but there is significant anecdotal evidence that suggests schools are bringing back teachers who used to work in them years previously or who are friends of a teacher in the school, rather than making an extra effort and making the telephone calls to new teachers to give them a chance.  We are considering tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to address that issue.  I appreciate there is a circular on the issue, but if a provision is required in terms of restriction, I suggest that it should be to restrict the use of retired teachers and ensure every step is taken to give the job opportunity to someone who needs it.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">On the issue of redeployment, I appreciate we need a system that works.  However, I am concerned about what is meant by consultation.  Management bodies have been in contact with me and other members in the past few days about what is meant by consultation, exasperated by the fact that the Bill landed on people's desks last week.  They are concerned as they have not had an opportunity to think it through.  When Second Stage concludes today I hope there will be a pause before Committee Stage in order that there is time for consultation.  I suggest the partners be invited to appear before the joint committee on education in order that members from all sides can hear where they are coming from, tease it through and hear where the Minister is coming from and what is intended.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that there will be a proper consultation process.  As he rightly said, partnership is one of the key aspects of the education system and the system works better when we listen to each other in respect of the experience on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">There is concern among some of the education partners about the change to support services and special needs.  The Minister has clarified that was because it had fallen between two stools.  The HSE has often used it as an excuse not to step up to the mark.  When something is deleted, particularly in such a sensitive area, people need to be reassured that the HSE will step up to the mark and that will not mean even less accountability for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Another issue raised at the meeting with the management bodies is whether the changes in respect of the redeployment scheme, and with the Department effectively designating rather than approving at a distance from the board of management, gives the Department a legal liability in future cases.  I am not sure if that is an issue but I am raising it as something that may need to the thought through because there is a long established principle that the teacher is employed by the board of management.  The question is whether a court will change that by saying one has to take this individual as opposed to the board of management having its say.  I said I would raise the issue with the Minister today.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">We have concerns about some aspects of the Bill.  With more information and consultation these can be addressed.  Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage but will table amendments on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to rethink the aspect of unqualified teachers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimDarcy" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Senator Jim D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_317">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire chuig an Seanad arís.  I thank the Minister for outlining the provisions in this complex Bill.  I agree with much of what Senator Power has said in respect of what may be teased out in the debate on later Stages.  In that context I shall refer to three or four issues, the first of which appears to be the imbedding of unqualified teachers into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">As a school principal for many years I know it is hard to get a qualified teacher on the spur of the moment.  With the intention of being helpful, the Bill appears to imbed unqualified teachers in the system.  Like Senator Power, I would prefer to have a retired teacher than an unqualified teacher within the school.  However, there are pragmatic issues in regard to the employment of unqualified teachers and we have to find the balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">On the issue of support services the amendment of the definition, in order to clarify the position in respect of the delivery of speech therapy services and other health and personal services, is of vital importance.  The provisions will not impact on the availability of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs through the HSE.  However, much work remains to be done to ensure the provision of services, such as speech and language and occupational vocational and behavioural therapy, are made available to children in a timely manner.  I am concerned that nobody will be compelled to offer support services which the Department of Education and Skills declines to offer.  Children with serious medical needs and none in schools could be left without assistance.  While I applaud the excellent work carried out by the cross-sectoral team I suggest it may be time to investigate the viability of establishing a central co-ordinating agency for the provision of specialist services to school children, the objective being to have a centre of excellence in each region.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">On the issue of teacher redeployment, there can be problems where the panel may not be cleared in a timely fashion, leading to a flurry of appointments after 1 September in some cases.  That is an ongoing problem.  To counterbalance that, boards of management consider they are losing the power to employ — as the Minister said — in emergency circumstances.  Could these emergency circumstances be used not by the Minister or his Department but in the future by a not so discerning person to override boards of management and management authorities for the flimsiest of reasons and take on the role of effective employment appointment, thus diminishing the powers and responsibilities of boards of management?  We have to strengthen the boards of management and get them to use their powers.  That would improve the quality of teaching and learning in schools, which should be the ultimate aim in legislation.  Some consider they are losing power and control.  Specifically, in what circumstances would the emergency powers be used by the Department of Education and Skills to appoint staff to schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I wish to refer to the appointment of unqualified teachers in schools.  This is a personal bugbear of mine — when provision was made in primary schools that teaching principals, in order to undertake administrative duties, would get 18 days off for four teacher schools or less and 22 days off in six teacher schools.  That led to the appointment of many unqualified teachers and took the teacher out of the classroom for 22 days.  This had a pernicious effect on the teaching and learning of pupils in the classroom and needs to be better regulated.  Sometimes principals take the class that is moving into secondary schools.  Would the Minister like his son or daughter to be without his or her class teacher for 22 days of the year?  Teaching principals need time for administrative tasks.  I estimate it costs at least €6,000 per annum to provide substitute teachers for a principal teacher.  Surely there is a better approach to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I welcome the Bill and the Minister's zeal in seeking to improve the quality of teaching and learning in schools.  I have concerns, however, about a couple of issues which could eventually develop into the thin edge of the wedge for boards of management and schools.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryMoran" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Senator Mary Moran</from>
          <p eId="para_323">I, too, welcome the Minister to the Seanad.  As stated, the Education (Amendment) Bill was presented to the Dáil by the previous Government but did not receive a hearing in the previous Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">On the housekeeping aspects of the Bill, I welcome the provision to abolish two quangos, the Educational Disadvantage Committee, which concluded its work in 2005, and the Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund, which was established in 1997 and had expended its funds by 2010.  While much valuable and worthwhile work was done by both quangos, their work has been completed and it makes sense to abolish them.  The role of the Educational Disadvantage Committee has been assumed by DEIS, which will ensure the issue of educational disadvantage remains a Government priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">As with Senator D'Arcy, I am a former teacher.  When the Teaching Council introduced a requirement to register several years ago I received a letter asking me to list all my qualifications, including the results of every single examination I had taken while at university.  While I fully respected and supported this requirement, many teachers asked the reason the council was seeking information on teachers' qualifications and requiring them to undergo Garda vetting when we had been teaching for more than 20 years in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I paid an annual subscription of €90 to the Teaching Council until May 2011.  At one point, when I telephoned the council and asked what I was getting for the fee I was told I had to pay it to get a job.  I indicated that as I already had a job I wanted some value for the €90 subscription.  I welcome the changes proposed in this regard because teaching, like other professions, needs a statutory professional body.  I look forward to the Teaching Council being given further powers as this will enable it to achieve much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Despite the circular issued by the Minister in May 2010 requiring schools to employ only appropriately qualified and registered teachers ahead of retired and unqualified teachers, many schools continue to employ retired teachers, including retired principals and deputy principals, to the detriment of newly qualified teachers.  This issue must be addressed.  I know of fantastic students of mine who have qualified and would make great teachers but cannot get a job.  As Senator Power noted, friends of other teachers have been employed in some cases.  Newly qualified teachers face a catch-22 scenario in that they cannot secure full-time employment without experience and they cannot gain experience until they secure a job.  Having invested so much in our young people to give them a good education, we do not want them to emigrate.  We must ensure we keep them here.  For this reason, I welcome the changes the Minister proposes in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I will focus briefly on the section which deals with empowering the Teaching Council as a regulator.  Currently, a teacher must merely pay a membership fee on an annual basis to be included in the register of teachers.  I welcome the provision which enables the Teaching Council to request proof of continuous professional development for registration.  This measure will bring the council into line with other professional regulators.  It is a vital initiative because teachers need to keep in touch with their skills.  Computers, which have become a prerequisite in teaching, did not feature in the classroom 30 years ago.  Some teachers have not mastered the necessary skills.  We must keep in touch with our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">As matters stand, a teacher could qualify with a higher diploma in education at the age of 22 years and teach a subject for the next 40 years without undertaking to participate in continuous professional development.  In this fast-changing society in which technology and methodologies are progressing every year, attendance at in-service and professional courses should be mandatary if our standards of education are to keep pace with those of other European countries.  I spoke previously about Ireland's track record among the OECD countries, which is not something to boast about.  Studies of the education systems of other countries, for example, Finland, have shown that continuous professional development is at the heart of progressive education.  While school principals are generally highly supportive of career development initiatives, they do not have the authority to insist a teacher attend a course.  If a teacher decides not to attend an in-service course, a principal cannot take any action.  To give an example, a recent in-service course in Gaeilge for second level teachers provided by An tSeirbhís Tacaíochta Dara Leibhéal don Ghaeilge, about which I spoke last week, had an attendance rate of 73%.  The course, which relates to the new leaving certificate course, will increase the value of the oral examination to 40%.  Why did the other 27% of teachers not attend and what knock-on effect will their failure to attend have on students taking the leaving certificate examination?</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Unfortunately, evidence shows that some teachers never avail of the career development offered to them and there is no onus on them to do so at present.  I welcome the proposed changes in the legislation in this respect.  Making evidence of continuous professional development a requirement of registration with the Teaching Council is a positive step in improving standards of education and learning and thus improving the education of our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I also welcome the plan to enable the Teaching Council to examine the accreditation for teacher education programmes.  I hope that in the minority of cases, if there are any, where high standards are not being met the Teaching Council will have the power to refuse accreditation  We must ensure that teachers who enter the teaching profession have been educated to the highest possible standards.  I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Teaching Council will have the authority to review all teacher education programmes and ensure our student teachers are receiving the best possible preparation for their professional careers.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">On the redeployment of teachers where they become surplus to the requirements of a school, I welcome the reform providing that consultation rather than agreement will have to take place with the Department of Education and Skills and the stakeholder.   This will expedite the process of redeployment and ensure resources are used to the best possible advantage with due regard given the employment council framework and the Croke Park agreement.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#RonanMullen" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen</from>
          <p eId="para_333">I welcome the Minister.  I have great appreciation for his talents and ability but I have significant concerns about this legislation and advise him to gird himself because I foresee a long Committee Stage, assuming it is allowed by the Government and there is no guillotine.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I draw the Minister's attention to a booklet called, A Brief Guide To How Your Parliament Works.  One of the advantages of having guests in Leinster House is that they sometimes draw our attention to things we should have perhaps seen ourselves.  On the legislative process, there is a question on page 17 of the booklet that asks if there is any consultation with the public, to which the answer is:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_335">Before a Bill is introduced, there will be consultation meetings and discussions with the Government Departments and groups likely to be affected by the Bill. Sometimes the Government will publish a Green Paper.  This is a discussion document which sets out the Government's ideas and invites comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The Minister presented this Bill today as, in effect, a rehash of a Bill previously introduced but as he acknowledged, there are very significant changes in this one.  This is, effectively, new legislation.  The first thing one should observe here is that there has not been consultation with the various groups and education partners on it and I wonder why that is the case.  My fear, to put it at its kindest, is that the Bill tends in a particular statist direction and has the potential to be applied in quite an ideological way.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The core issue in regard to redeployment is the departure from a notion of agreement towards a mere idea of consultation.  This is what is proposed to be done.  The Minister presented that in terms of expediting decisions, good administration and so on.  However, the fact is that when we talk about education, we are talking about a very peculiar and particular type of service to people which has an important constitutional dimension.  It is not like other services, such as the provision of water, policing and the like.  The provision of education in Ireland is founded on the primacy of parents, in particular.  The spirit of the education legislation to date has been that education is a matter on which important decisions are taken in partnership with patrons, trustees, management, unions and so on.  That is a vitally important principle.  Throughout this legislation, I see a departure from that principle and nowhere is it more obvious than on the issue of redeployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Minister is well aware of, and there has been much discussion about, section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 which protects the rights of religious run institutions to take necessary employment decisions in order to protect their ethos.  I am informed that section was required in that legislation lest it be unconstitutional.  The Minister can take his own advice on that.  By giving himself the powers he does on the issue of redeployment and by effectively proposing the ability of the Department to impose certain employment decisions on school managers in this way, he undermines the whole spirit of what section 37 proposes to guarantee.  In the case of a Catholic school, there could be a person who is not suitable from the point of view of a Catholic school's employment.  The person could have radical views on abortion or whatever.  It might not be of concern to some other school employer but under this, it seems quite possible that a different view could hold sway.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">It is not just a question of Catholic concerns.  Church of Ireland schools rightly seek to employ and deploy within their panel.  It seems that is undermined.  Too often in our society such concerns are characterised as sectarian when, in fact, they are concerns for legitimate diversity in the provisions of education, according to the will of parents, faith communities and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It is not just a question of concern to faith communities.  For example, special schools could find themselves in a situation where somebody from a mainstream school is foisted on them, despite that person not being the most eligible or most suitable for that position.  The Minister might say that would never happen and that the Department would always consult very carefully but last year there was a situation where the visiting teachers for Travellers, some of whom might not have had much, or any, experience of teaching in a school room, were effectively visited on certain special schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">As nice as the word "consultation" sounds, it is not a patch on the word "agreement" because agreement requires that the State pull in its horns and respect the fact there are other bodies which deserve to have a strong input into the making of certain decisions.  "Consultation" in that context is a very weak word.  I stress again the peculiar constitutional context in which we are operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I note there is nothing in the legislation which provides for any consultation procedure.  No definition of "redeployment" is offered.  I cannot but conclude that this is, in effect, a grab for power for the Minister, his Department and his successors in a way which I do not believe is conducive to a genuine spirit of partnership in the making of important decisions about education.  Other concerns have been expressed.  In the new primacy of mere consultation over agreement, we see that the same applies in this Bill to decisions on suspension and dismissal.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I also have concerns on the particular needs of persons with disability.  The operation of section 40 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 will change if this legislation goes through and the Minister will not have the function of requesting the assistance of relevant health authority in respect of planning, provision and co-ordination of support services.  The Minister made the point that the HSE has the responsibility for providing services but the trouble is that if the HSE does not adequately provide, or does not provide these various special support services, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or whatever, adequately, is the duty on the Minister to ensure such services are provided weakened by what is in the legislation?  I would welcome the Minister's answer to that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I am concerned about the amendment of the definition of "educational disadvantage" in the legislation.  Section 4 amends section 32 of the Education Act 1998 which states that educational disadvantage means "the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".  Is there an issue here concerning children who are outside the school system?  I could go on but I have said enough to indicate there are major concerns with this legislation.  I propose to revisit these and other issues on Committee Stage, if I can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FidelmaHealyEames" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</from>
          <p eId="para_345">I welcome the Minister and his officials.  This is a fairly significant Bill.  As I see it, it amends the Education Act 1988.  It is not a small matter at all.  The previous Minister, Mary Coughlan, introduced a Bill in 2010 but she did not bring it to the Seanad so this is our first chance to give it a good reading.  I am really only in the process of fully understanding the whole thing but I will raise approximately five points with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Some key areas are built into this Bill. Senator Mullen raised the issue of section 24(3).  Under the section, boards of management will be consulted and it will no longer be necessary to reach agreement with them on the appointment and dismissal of teachers.  This provision has created serious concerns.  While I have no doubt the measure is intended in the best spirit and I accept the Minister may wish to acquire certain emergency powers, for example, in the case of a person who is blocking a panel and preventing a school from recruiting a teacher, the concern among the partners is that the Bill places the redeployment panel on a statutory footing and embeds it in legislation.  The redeployment panel is already in place under the Croke Park agreement and, as such, teachers are protected.  The fear, however, is that pupils are being overlooked.  I ask the Minister to respond to allow me to tease out this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Under section 15 of the Education Act, it is the responsibility of boards of management to deliver an appropriate education for each child.  Members of boards believe that if the Minister chooses to impose teachers on their schools, rather than seeking agreement, as is the current position, the solution may not provide the right fit for the children of their school.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether, in extreme circumstances, he will be able to decide which teacher is allocated to which school.  Heretofore, such decisions were taken by agreement, which was a better arrangement.  Why is this measure being introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The primary concern among boards of management is that they are the employer whereas the Department of Education and Skills is the paymaster.  This has always been a problem and in this case while the rights of boards of management as an employer are being diminished, their responsibilities remain intact.  They fear their hands are being tied and cases may be taken to the High Court with the taxpayer footing the bill.  I am keen to discover if this is the case.  On a point of law, where would the ultimate responsibility reside if an appropriate education was not being delivered to the pupils of a school?  As Senator Mullen noted, when a visiting teacher had to be redeployed last year the Department wrote to a school stating that it must employ a certain teacher.  While I can accept this practice to some extent on the basis that visiting teachers are employed by the Department rather than specific schools, boards of management fear that this approach could become more widespread.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">On unqualified teachers, given the battles we have all fought, it would be disingenuous and hypocritical of me to claim I could stand over any unqualified teacher entering the classroom.  The Minister has said much the same thing.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to implement a proposal I received from a school that he establish a unique panel to be used in exceptional circumstances where teachers cannot be found for schools in remote locations.  The panel would then be deferred to provide an appropriate teacher, for example, in the case of a second level school which cannot find a teacher for a class.  I was informed of a case where an honours engineering graduate was found for such a class.  It would be possible to find high quality teachers if one had a panel with individuals on call.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I am concerned about services for children with special needs.  We are not sure who has ultimate responsibility in this area because the Health Service Executive has provided a highly inconsistent service across the country.  The Minister indicated that speech therapy is not the responsibility of the HSE.  Will he work with the executive to ensure speech therapy services are provided in schools or on the basis of clusters?  Children are losing a significant amount of contact time because they are often required to leave school to avail of speech therapy?  I had to deliver a child to the health board for speech therapy in the past, with the result that the child spent half a day outside the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The Minister indicated that DEIS and educational disadvantage remain a departmental priority.  I am not convinced that is the case given the decision to confine the review of DEIS schools to urban areas only.  As I informed the Minister this morning, unemployment in areas of Connemara stands at 80%.  In some cases, children in DEIS schools have been able to get parents who cannot read excited about reading and scores are improving.  DEIS has been wonderful.  I ask the Minister to review his policy to find out what is working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I am pleased it has been decided to accredit teacher education programmes where it is appropriate to do so.  It is good to review existing programmes.  I also welcome the provision to increase the bachelor of education degree from three to four years.  When will this take effect and when will the higher diploma in education be extended from 18 months to two years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanDBarrett" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_353">I welcome the Minister who has taken an interest in education throughout his political career.  I note the number of vocational education committees is to be reduced from 33 to 16 and commend the Minister for going further than the recommendation by an bord snip that it be reduced to 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">One of the challenges facing Irish education is to reduce bureaucracy and spend resources in the classroom.  I note an bord snip noted that if one divides the number of pupils by the number of teachers at primary level, the average class size would be 16 and if all adults on the payroll are included — I presume this refers to special needs assistants — the average class size would be 12.  One regularly hears complaints from people outside the Houses and elsewhere about classes of 40 children.  How is this possible if the ratio of pupils to teachers in primary schools is sufficient to produce an average class size of 16?</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Senator Jim D'Arcy cited an example of teachers being out of the classroom for 22 days in a school year.  I suspect the bureaucratisation of Irish education has resulted in teachers being promoted out of the job for which they trained and want to do and into another where they earn more money by sitting in an office.  Speaking as a person who is involved in education, this approach must be questioned.  The part of our work for which we were trained and which gives us the most satisfaction is being with students and pupils.  Sometimes the Department must take responsibility for excessive bureaucratisation.  We should try to reduce paperwork and bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I was somewhat taken aback when career guidance teachers protested about measures the Minister has taken that will result in them returning to the classroom.  It was as if returning to the classroom was a form of torture, rather than the most important aspect of a teacher's career.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I question the need for the Higher Education Authority given that we have only seven universities.  Could we not write seven cheques and deploy all available resources to provide education?  We must use the recession to emphasise what takes place in the classroom rather than in boardrooms or bureaucracies.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I support any measure that will tackle the use of unqualified teachers in the classroom.  The particular aspect of the lack of qualifications the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, have tried to tackle is the lack of qualification in mathematics.  I deplore the failure of a large number of schools to reply to a departmental questionnaire which asked whether their mathematics teachers were qualified to teach the subject.  This appears to be a simple and straightforward question which should have been answered given that the Minister is the paymaster of schools.  Some estimates from the Royal Irish Academy indicate that 80% of mathematics teaching at second level is done by people who do not have a qualification in the subject.  As a member of a university board, I have tried to interest people in bringing together mathematics departments and departments teaching the higher diploma in education to try to tackle this problem.  The solution of providing bonus points placed the onus on the student and did nothing to address the 80% of students who are being taught mathematics by an unqualified teacher.  It gave a bonus to those who could afford grinds or were fortunate enough to attend a school with a qualified mathematics teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Royal Irish Academy has also noted a problem in respect of languages.  Far too many language departments have been shut down in our universities in the surge towards being world leaders in science, technology and innovation.  Speaking to people in foreign languages could do us more good.  Addressing both the mathematics and foreign languages problem would not cost much money because both are low cost subjects compared with some of the other areas into which we have ventured.  I will discuss these issues in greater detail on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">A series of reports which addressed the issue of education, including the Hunt report and various reports on the knowledge and innovation economy, were drawn up by groups which did not include a single person who worked in the classroom.  It is strange that those who do the work have been deemed by the bureaucrat class to be not worth talking to while everyone outside the education system is deemed to be an expert.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I welcome the Minister's long-term interest in education and look forward to further debate.  We must address the deployment of teachers and the issue of unqualified teachers.  Some of the gloss, as the Minister noted, has gone off Irish education.    We persuaded ourselves that we had one of the most advanced systems in the world.  Part of this recession is realising there is an awful lot of work to do.  I will support the Minister in any reforms in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AideenHayden" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I welcome the Minister.  This Bill is about many things but it is also about enhancing service delivery and achieving cost savings.  I recognise that some of the measures contained in it represent a significant departure from previous practice in that they require the Minister to put in place procedures to govern the appointment and dismissal of teachers after consultation rather than agreement with the various stakeholders, including the teacher unions.  I accept this change is necessary to give effect to the Croke Park agreement.  However, it is important to acknowledge that the power contained in this Bill is for the introduction of procedures.  In setting out these procedures, I am sure the Minister will be guided by the wide body of legislation around employment law and current best practice in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I note that during the debate on this topic in 2010, the Minister, in looking at the transfer of some of these powers to the VECs in terms of their part in primary school formation and takeovers, noticed that there was some transparency in regard to matters of ethos, so I am sure he will be concerned that ethos would be respected in any of the measures he is putting in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I welcome the measure introduced in this legislation to give statutory backing to the redeployment of teachers.  Recent evidence from the CSO suggests that the population is on an upward trajectory and we need to have robust procedures in place to enable us to make the most of our educational resources.  Over the past decade, because of the pressures in regard to the cost of housing, in particular, we have seen a very significant transfer of families from inner urban areas to outer suburban areas.  That has placed enormous stress on the education system because of the lack of facilities in these outer suburban areas.  We have two choices here.  We can take the children from outer suburban areas and bring them into inner urban areas where teachers are deployed or we can take teachers from inner urban areas and redeploy them in outer suburban areas.  What we require, however, is flexibility within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">We must also ensure teachers are available in the most disadvantaged areas and to the most vulnerable children.  In 2005, an OECD study noted that there were concerns in most countries, including Ireland, about the inequitable distribution of teachers and, in particular, that students in disadvantaged areas did not have the quality of teaching they required.  Our most disadvantaged children require our most serious commitment.  In that respect, we must have the capacity to redeploy our resources to where they are most needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I refer to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 7 relates to the employment of unregistered teachers.  I agree this measure is of concern.  However, given his previous statements on this matter, we must accept the Minister has given full consideration to it.  If he regards it as a requirement that this facility be available and that employment of unregistered teachers is necessary in certain conditions, I accept his view.  However, when it comes to prescribing the circumstances where an unregistered teacher may be employed, it must not be in a situation which could undermine the quality of teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Given the number of unemployed qualified teachers, which has been mentioned by many colleagues, it would be very useful if the Minister could put in place a database of these unemployed qualified teachers and that such a database would be made available to every school in the country and to any principal who finds himself or herself in need of a short-term teacher.  Given the concerns the Minister raised, I also suggest there is a need for a bias in giving teaching experience to young qualified teachers.  Therefore, I suggest that database be set up with a view to giving young qualified teachers such an opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I welcome the provisions relating to continuing professional development education.  As somebody who comes from the legal profession, I am familiar with the variable quality, to say the least, and the severe cost it can sometimes impose on professionals.  Will the Minister ensure continuing professional development in the teaching profession is designed as a beacon of light to other professions?</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I welcome the Minister's update on the forum on patronage and pluralism in the primary school sector.  I notice that the initial reflections are supportive of the community national school model.  I note the Minister raised concerns in 2010 about the potential democratic deficit of having the VECs take on the role of establishing and running community primary schools.  Therefore, I ask him to ensure he takes into account the broadest possible democratic principles in terms of any recommendations from this forum.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathrynReilly" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Senator Kathryn Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I welcome the Minister.  I am glad to have the opportunity to discuss this Bill given that it is a very tough time for education in Ireland.  I would like to make a few points on the legislation.  In regard to more power being given to the Minister to decide on appointments and redeployments in the name of legal certainty and efficiency, my concern is around the nature of the new powers, which Senator Mullen mentioned earlier.  Does this change in the Bill confer the Minister with discretionary powers to redeploy or dismiss teaching staff without adherence to the necessary safeguards in place to protect an individual's employment rights?  As was mentioned earlier, it seems to weaken the roles of schools and other parties at the expense of the Minister.  People have asked me what is the justification for this.  Is there evidence that it will be more efficient or will it lead to disgruntled partners in the process?</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Like Senator Mullen, I have queries about schools with varying ethos.  What recourse will there be to veto the appointment of teachers who they believe to do not suit their ethos?  In regard to gaelscoileanna, how will this affect the quality of Irish language teachers?  Will that be guaranteed in those schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In regard to the renewal of the registration and the conditionality, it seems to be a positive step but I would like guarantees that there will not be any delays because of the new procedures involved.  The recent experience of a constituent of mine of delays in registering which, in turn, meant delays in taking up a job she had been offered are a cause of concern for me in respect of this section as is the introduction of conditionality.  The last thing we want is for young qualified teachers to be forced into a situation in which they cannot take up a job because their renewal is pending.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Minister mentioned that the council may apply conditions such as continuing education and training, evidence of character and teaching experience.  What steps will be taken to ensure the annual registration process is not too onerous on young unemployed teachers?  For example, a young trained teacher might not get employment for a year or two years after his or her college training and might need to stay in other employment to keep afloat.  How would he or she meet potential conditions such as continuing education and training or teaching experience if he or she has not been in a job since leaving college and perhaps a year or two years later is renewing his or her registration?  Have the teacher unions been consulted on that part of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_374">What are the views of the teacher unions in regard to the employment of unregistered teachers?  Many speakers spoke about unregistered teachers.  Given that there are so many qualified teachers, how can there be cases of unregistered teachers?  I would support substitute panels of people who are on-call or the type of substitute panel which Senator Healy Eames mentioned.  If there are exceptional cases, could we not have plans B, C and D ready for that?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In regard to the abolition of the educational disadvantage committee, it made its final report in 2005 and has not convened since.  In light of the abolition of that committee and given that the Combat Poverty Agency, which had a specific interest in educational disadvantage is no longer in existence, what procedures are in place to identify and monitor the needs of students who are educationally disadvantaged given that research confirms that it is widespread and that approximately 60% of disadvantaged students do not attend DEIS schools?  What measures are in place for data collection on educational advantage, policy formation and stakeholder partnerships?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianODomhnaill" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill</from>
          <p eId="para_376">Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil deis agam labhairt faoin mBille seo atá os comhair an tSeanaid inniu don Dara Léamh.  Bille tábhachtach éó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais de, go háirithe i dtaca le múinteoirí, an fhoirm teagaisc agus an ról atá ag múinteoirí agus na deiseanna a bheidh ag múinteoirí post a fháil amach anseo.  Tá cuid mhór cainte agus plé faoi láthair faoi seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">As the Minister will be aware, there is currently much discussion in the educational sector about the many experienced and committed professional teachers who will be leaving the system in the coming weeks.  It is important to ensure that those posts are replaced.  In my own constituency, three out of four teachers in a school in the heart of a Gaeltacht area are taking the redundancy package at the end of February.  Three teachers will be on panels to replace those fluent native Irish speakers.  Because of the way the panel is structured, the principal must accept the person who is placed highest on the panel even though the individual may not have fluency in Irish and may not be able to perform their duties through the medium of Irish.  Up to the end of June therefore that Gaeltacht school will face those difficulties.  I ask the Minister to examine that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">As I mentioned on the Adjournment last week, retention figures for small schools and the staffing schedules involved are matters of concern in the education sector.  As changes have been made to schools with 86 pupils or less, alarm bells are ringing in all such schools.  We have 3,200 primary schools, some 47% of which have five teachers or less.  All the international expertise shows that pupils in smaller schools gain educational advantage over those in larger establishments.  As a public representative from rural Ireland, I would argue strongly that the cost savings to be achieved by closing or amalgamating schools — or by reducing teacher numbers — cannot be justified simply on the basis of efficiencies.  While the McCarthy report may have recommended that the amalgamations would save €25 million, the Minister should forget about that.  He should make a calculated decision to protect small schools in order that those children can continue to receive primary education in their own areas.  As hundreds of millions of euro have been spent on upgrading small schools in recent years, it would be to the detriment of rural areas if such schools were forced to amalgamate now.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Following last week's Adjournment debate, I got a reply which said that no school will be closed by the Minister.  In effect, however, the conditions being imposed on small schools will be so stringent, with the loss of teachers and resource teaching hours, that they will be forced to amalgamate.  That is happening in the North of Ireland, which is worse than what the Minister is proposing.  Any school with fewer than 105 pupils in the North of Ireland is facing the possibility of extinction.  I know that because I have a number of relations teaching in schools in the North of Ireland.  In fact, I have a cousin, to whom I spoke yesterday, who is principal of a school in the North of Ireland where they are very concerned by the cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I appeal to the Minister to protect smaller schools here.  I have received communications from teachers and teacher unions concerning the Bill before us.  My colleague Senator Averil Power, who is the Fianna Fáil education spokesperson, has made these points also.  I note that there will be consultation on the redeployment and dismissal of teachers, and that the Minister will be given greater power in this respect.  However, that is a cause of great concern, particularly to younger teachers.  If the Minister's policy proposal concerning schools with 86 pupils or less is to be implemented, younger teachers will inevitably be put onto panels.  I hope the Minister will reverse that policy change but if not we will see many younger teachers being forced onto panels.  If the Croke Park agreement is amended or torn up, their future will be in limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I have spoken to many younger teachers who are concerned about section 6 of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to take those concerns into consideration.  We will have an opportunity to table amendments on Committee Stage, on which Senator Averil Power is working.  Section 6 is one of the most worrying parts of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Perhaps the Minister can clarify why the education disadvantage committee, which has been in existence since 2005, is being abolished.  I know that time is limited and I thank my county colleague, Senator Harte, for being lenient with me.  I am sure we will have more time to debate the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.  Education is at a crossroads and that is particularly the case for small, rural schools.  We must protect the teachers who work in them.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to the House.  He is an unusually good choice for this portfolio and I know he will do well in it.  There have been some difficulties concerning free third level fees and I know that a former Labour Party Minister introduced them.  However, I always thought that was an ugly, oxymoronic phrase; either education is free or one pays fees.  It is as simple as that.  I knew it was inevitable that fees would be paid in universities.  My view was that the battle should be between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Finance, in order that the level of means-testing would be set at a point where people who were disadvantaged and had talent to go university should be able to do so.  I did not receive much positive comment back from my constituency on that matter but I told the truth.  I always try to tell the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I apologise to the Minister for not being here for his speech, but I was attending the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which was dealing with the important subject of Haiti.  In Haiti, some 4,000 schools were destroyed by the earthquake in 2010.  In addition, half the population under 18 have not even received a primary education.  Compared to that, we are in an extraordinarily good position here.  We have a fine tradition of schools, no matter what the material resources were.  We can be justly proud of our educational system, although it goes through changes which can be painful.  The schools were established by the British imperial authorities in the early 19th century and have gone through a series of — to a certain degree — sectarian managerial and patronage control.  I welcome the Minister's honesty and courage in addressing this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I also pay tribute to Archbishop Martin who has shown himself to be practical, realistic and flexible in this area.  My own church, the Church of Ireland, has shown similar resistance to what it sees as secularisation.  As a believing Christian, I think it is largely the responsibility of parents to provide the ethos, while schools provide background facts about religious history, the literary impact and all these kind of things.  It is the responsibility primarily of parents.  I was slightly taken aback to hear an attempted defence by Senator Mullen of the sections in the equality legislation that fail to protect certain sections of society.  That was also done by a Labour Party Minister, Mervyn Taylor, but it was a practical inevitability at the time.  It was regrettable and Joe O'Toole and I argued against it.  I would not wish to do Senator Mullen an injustice and think I am correcting him when he said that the ethos should be respected and that certain teachers were not suitable because of their strong views on issues such as abortion.  One must be very careful there because it is perfectly possible for a teacher to have strong views on any subject, ranging from Palestine, Israel, abortion, homosexuality and pornography, but not necessarily inflict them on students.  If they retain these as their private views, there is no justification for dismissing them.  I hope the Government will address that and those sections of equality legislation need to be addressed in order to assuage the genuine fears of teachers, including gay teachers.  I was astonished to hear my esteemed colleague from Sinn Féin, Senator Reilly, support Senator Mullen.  I recommend her to look at the Eileen Flynn case and the elements involved.  It was a question of her lifestyle, which was apparently outside the social norms, and also the republican connections that were cited.  I wonder if Sinn Féin would be happy with the idea that people could be kicked out of a job because they were "Shinners".  I hope that view will be examined again.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">This was also regarded as a grab for power but the Minister for Education and Skills should have certain powers.  He devolves that power under section 6 that was impugned by some of my colleagues.  The section seems a valuable and appropriate contribution to the development of education, giving responsibility to principals.  It also sets out an educational ethos, not a sectarian ethos, for the educational advancement of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Minister referred to speech therapy, which I hope will be protected.  A number of years ago I raised a matter on the Adjournment concerning the parents of two autistic children who lost the services of a speech therapist because they moved district in Dublin.  Autistic children do not just stop improving, they go backwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Disadvantage has been taken in under the DEIS programme and I hope it will be vigorous in pursuing the issue. Even though I do not come from the wonderful County Donegal, the Larkin school and Marlborough Street, where the wonderful Breaking the Cycle project was introduced, are in my area. We must have this basis. The first doctor, lawyer, teacher and Deputy from these areas, rather than those involved in drugs, will become role models</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The increase in the demand for education was dramatically illustrated last night. Senator Barrett will agree with me. When I was in Trinity College, Dublin the total staff, teaching and student body was 3,000; it is now 20,000. That feeds in from the greater education in our schools. Although we are slipping at the top end, in 17 areas of scientific research in Trinity College, Dublin we are in the top 1%. We can be proud of that but we need a base and, with this Bill, the Minister is providing it. It may need some modification but I do not share the views of some of my other colleagues.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
          <p eId="para_393">I thank the Senators who have contributed and for the broad support for the Bill.  Some people were familiar with it in another time.  As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said, it is the first time this House has debated the Bill.  It is a short Bill that embraces some fundamental points of education.  As Senator Power said, the measures are largely technical and I will deal generally with the issues that arose, including deployment and qualified teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Regarding deployment, the employment control framework is one of the concomitant consequences of the loss of economic sovereignty.  We do not have control over the numbers employed in our public services.  The memorandum of understanding and the negotiations with the troika oblige us to reduce expenditure on our current account, because we are spending €19 billion more on services than we are taking in taxes, which is twice the entire budget of the Department of Education and Skills.  We must get there in two ways, one of which is by reducing public service numbers.  The role of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and line Departments such as the Department of Education and Skills involves strict guidelines and control mechanisms.  Specifically, where a teacher becomes supernumerary to a school for whatever reason and is on a panel, the person must be redeployed before we can hire a new student teacher who has qualified from the teacher training colleges.  I can come back to this issue in detail on Committee Stage.  Last year there was a large redeployment project.  I was there for the latter part of it and it was handled exceptionally well.  The concerns expressed by a number of people about being redeployed against their will or inappropriately allocated to different schools, did not materialise.  We can get into the detail of that when we talk about it, when I will be better prepared to provide Senators with chapter and verse.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Senator Mullen expressed concerns about that area, which has history.  There was a High Court case that did not proceed but we must have a certain degree of give and take.  The ethos of the school is particularly important for all concerned but there are some aspects of the curriculum to which the schools, which receive public money, have signed up to.  The teaching of geography is something that is not influenced by ethos, religious belief, other belief or sexual orientation.  We must be selective in how we examine these measures in terms of the precise role of the teacher in a particular school.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Regarding section 30 and the Teaching Council, the most important element in this legislation enables section 30 to come into effect.  This will enable the teaching profession to go fully professional in the same sense as lawyers, medical practitioners and architects.  In order to practise as a teacher, lawyer, medic or architect, one must be registered in the profession and one must reregister on an annual basis.  Senator Moran pointed out that previously there was merely an obligation to pay €90 and one was registered.  There was no obligation to verify that one had maintained continual professional development and was in the process of renewal.  We must all do this and in politics we call it an election but the professions do not necessarily see it in that way.  The Teaching Council, the CPD requirements, the conditionality that now applies as a consequence of this legislation will enable teachers to do what many right-wing commentators say, which is that if there is a bad teacher, one cannot get rid of him or her.  It is a frequent dinner party topic of conversation among people who have little or no contact with schools in recent times.  Just like bad lawyers and bad doctors, the profession is probably the best to regulate its own affairs at this point in time.  The Teaching Council currently has a majority of teachers, as the Medical Council at one stage had a majority of medical professionals.  There will be an organic move towards a balance of professionals and lay people.  This measure will enable the Teaching Council, which is dominated by teachers, to ensure it will exercise, with the knowledge of the system, the necessary disciplinary powers that are required to the point where a registered teacher would be deprived of the validity to practice as a teacher and not be able to teach in a  State-funded school.  If that sanction, after due process and natural law, is exercised it will send a signal, as it is intended to do, to every other person in the profession.  That is to be welcomed.  When we get into the detail of that we can look at how it has to be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Senator Mary Moran welcomed the abolition of quangos, as she called them.  Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to the EDC.  It was stood down in 2005 when DEIS band 1 and band 2 were introduced.  DEIS effectively replaced two other well intentioned but <i>ad hoc</i> schemes that did not have the same basis of scientific analysis and assessment as DEIS ones.  There are anomalies in the allocation of resources to schools that need them.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The question of unqualified teachers being hired has vexed this debate and was to the fore in the teachers conferences I attended, particularly the INTO in Sligo last year.  Unqualified teachers are not hired by aliens or people from Mars.  They are hired by principals in schools, in many cases.  One has to look at the way in which unqualified or retired teachers are hired.  The entire profession, not just the Department of Education and Skills, including boards of management has to have regard to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">There is a comfort factor in having somebody down the road whose abilities one knows, who can be called in easily to help and who knows the school and landscape.  We would all gravitate towards that situation, which needs to be recognised and understood.  It is not fair for people who are trying to work on probation.  A Senator made the point that one cannot get a job if one does not have experience and if one does not have experience one is caught in a catch-22 situation.  We have to break that.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">There is now a requirement for schools to publish the identity of a substitute person and we can develop that.  I made the point in my Second Stage opening remarks that if there is a choice to be made by the management of the school — frequently this involves small schools — between closing a school for a day and sending all the children home, perhaps to an empty house because both parents might be out working, something that was not the case 20 or 30 years ago, that is more irresponsible then keeping them with an unqualified or retired person.  We are trying to move from the current situation to a point where, in certain circumstances, principals can, for a period of time specified in the legislation, take in somebody.  They will have to account for that and we can examine how that is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Let us be very clear.  The reason we have had to modify the application of section 30 of the Teaching Council legislation is precisely because of a very important piece that is unaltered in the legislation.  Under the current legislation before the Bill is enacted, anybody who is hired by the State to teach in a school will not be paid if he or she is not qualified.  Oireachtas moneys cannot be used to pay an unqualified teacher.  I can confirm that on Committee Stage when we discuss the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">As the provision is so absolute there has to be an emergency clause.  Some day a system will break down and special circumstances must be taken account of.  A school should not be faced with a choice between sending children home or, as somebody suggested, bundling up children in different classrooms.  There could be health and safety and all sorts of other problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">It may have been done but it is not regarded as very good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I have dealt with the High Court case and the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  I have a note on redeployment, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_407">We already have an agreed redeployment scheme at second level which worked well in 2011.  A previous version of the second level redeployment scheme was the subject of a High Court case in which the then AG's office advised that there was a fundamental strategic weakness in the department having to secure agreement with all parties to effect change in relation to certain terms and conditions of employment of teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">This is a response to that legal observation and we are trying to have consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The record of consultation between the Department of Education and Skills and stakeholders in education is there for people to examine.  Anybody who has taken time to look at the ongoing engagement in consultation with the stakeholders in education would realise the Department is the last to rush into a summary decision, having had perfunctory consultation. As long as I am Minister there will not be a change in that direction.  The fears that can be read from the black and white of a statement, that says an agreement gave people, in effect, a veto on consultation that could simply be window-dressing, will not be realised. There will be real consultation because it is not in the interests of the Department to provoke a reaction of that kind by simply going through the motions of consultation and not being sincere.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Senator Healy Eames referred to redeployment, deployment, the role of patron bodies, unqualified teachers, special needs services  and the HSE.  This Bill is tightening the legislation.  There was a lacuna between the Department of Health, and subsequently the HSE, in the delivery of services and that interface with the Department of Education and Skills and schools.  The clarification in the Bill is based on the experience the Department has had.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Senator Barrett made a number of points.  I remind him the HEA now caters for more than just seven universities.  It may come as a surprise but there are 13 institutes of technology and a number of other institutions that come within its ambit.  It started out with just seven universities.  I know some elements of the universities are not happy about having to cross the River Liffey and deal with Marlborough Street.  Until the 1960s they were funded by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach.  A certain Mr. Whitaker, who is much admired by everybody in this House, decided to send the responsibility for universities to the then Department of Education with the marvellous administrative resource of one assistant principal, a certain Mr. Dukes who is the father of the current Mr. Dukes we know of.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">A question was asked about community national schools and primary schools.  There was consolidated legislation before a committee today to establish new local education and training boards legislation which, <i>inter alia</i>, involves the consolidation of nine pieces of primary legislation and a host of statutory instruments.  Given the power of the VECs, now to be known as the local education and training boards, to have the possibility to operate as patrons of what are known as community national schools, the legislation should be properly vested in that comprehensive legislation.  It was in the original draft of the Bill when it was before the Dáil.  It was retrospective, because in response to a demographic crisis schools were set up on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis with the Minister for Education and Skills being the patron.  Initially the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Martin, was the patron of one school because of this demographic crisis.  It was a temporary measure to retrospectively provide some legal basis but from a legislative point of view it is better to have it where it properly belongs, that is, within the framework of the local education and training boards.  We will return to that debate and question.  In the context of what was raised, the report on the forum on pluralism and patronage is virtually complete but has yet to be brought to the Government.  It will be brought to it in a matter of weeks.  When it is published, there will be a possibility that this House or the Dáil could consider having a debate thereon.  It will require considerable discussion by all the relevant stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Senator referred to a database of qualified teachers.  We are moving in that direction.  A circular issued in May 2011 stated schools are required to maintain a list of available registered teachers.  Senator Reilly, who is no longer present, expressed similar concerns over redeployment, and these have been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to having a panel.  Where recent arrivals on the panel have a more fluent command of Irish than some others, it gives rise to an issue concerning both the quality of Irish teaching in Gaeltacht schools and the rights of redeployed teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Questions were asked on small rural schools.  This is not a problem that Ireland has.  Last Monday, I participated in a discussion with the heads of the inspectorates from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and our own head inspector, Dr. Harold Hislop.  Countries such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia are dealing with similar issues.  We have a statutory obligation to deliver education across the country, irrespective of geography or the population base, but it must be quality education.  The world has changed.  As Professor John Coolahan has written in his history of Irish education, there were at one stage over 6,000 primary schools.  The system is 181 years old this year.  There has been change in so many aspects of life that rural schools cannot be considered to be insulated therefrom.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">No school closes because a teacher is lost.  From the data I have seen, I note the factor that will, in the majority of cases, reduce the number of teachers in a school is falling enrolment.  I accept that the thresholds that I started to increase will possibly accelerate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">They will decide.  When a school loses a teacher, the school does not necessarily close.  The teacher does not lose his or her job, and this is why we had the debate on deployment.  We need, however, to ascertain how we can achieve the delivery of a quality primary education system in parts of the country where the populations have changed, for reasons we all understand.  We must determine how we can maintain standards and use new methods of communication and transport.  We must examine what other countries are doing in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">In the next six to eight weeks, we will have the value for money report on small schools.  It covers just under 600 schools, each with a student population of 50 or fewer.  Much work is being done on it.  We might have an informed debate when it is published.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">On the changes that are to take place, if they do take place, I am told nine out of ten schools will not be affected by the measures next September.  There is an appeal process for small schools.  When they receive their allocations of teachers in the coming three or four weeks, they will then be able to appeal to the Department specifying how the allocations affect them.  There are precedents such that one can say the potential student population in a given area is greater than the Department is estimating.  We can now verify that.  As I stated on another occasion in this House, the Department has an electronic geographical information system that tracks the child benefit payment, both by age and location, right across the country.  We can, as a consequence, determine the potential demand for education.  It would not make sense, knowing what is likely to happen over the next three or four years, to make an intervention based on a dip in a given year that would cause the kind of disruption in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">These are matters we will examine, but we cannot ignore facts on the ground.  These facts are that the population is changing in some areas and that we must respond to that change.</p>

Consider the spectrum beginning with a primary school of that scale and ending with one such as the one I opened recently just outside Naas, which has 700 pupils, including young preschool, crèche and special needs children.  Trying to deliver the same curriculum to the latter school, with its required number of teachers and resources, and to some of the smaller schools is difficult, even in good or flaithiúlach times.  We are not in flaithiúlach times — quite the contrary — and we must, therefore, be open to considering changes.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I am sure all 59 other Senators would agree wholeheartedly with the title of the motion and would aspire that it be reflective of Ireland in the not so distant future.  However, we are no different from any of the politicians who have gone before us.  Every last one of them would have pledged something similar throughout their political careers.  Therefore, one has got to ask why this shared application has not been recognised.  It has not been from lack of will, time, effort and financial investment in the disability arena.  To my mind, the answer lies within the motion document before us.  I am sure Members will agree the motion covers a vast number of hugely expansive and highly complex issues pertaining to disability, although it is by no means a conclusive list.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Before I continue, to focus and centre our minds, I will repeat the first sentence of the motion, which seeks to recognise the need to protect and maintain disability supports and services in order to enhance the participation and inclusion of people with disabilities in Ireland.  In my own plain language, I would like us to ensure that all 750,000 people who have disabilities in this country are treated like citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">My aim while formulating this motion was to be as far-reaching as possible and to expose issues which hamper the daily life of people with a disability and their families.  Deputy Simon Harris encapsulated perfectly the problem which arises on the rare occasion that disability issues are discussed in the wider public domain in a recent opinion in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  His article was entitled “Anger without action changes nothing for the disabled” and detailed the emotive debate which erupted following the changes that were going to be made to the payment of disability allowance to young people in December’s budget.  This led to the eventual pausing of the measure.  Deputy Harris’ central point, which I share, was that great outrage without reform never gives a great result.  That is exactly what happened in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I am not a politician by nature or definition but I am someone who has worked to promote the rights and care for some of the most disabled children in the State through the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation.  Therefore, it is my hope that this debate in the Seanad will be both informative and productive.  I want it to be free from political point-scoring by all sides.  I would use this evening in a small way to raise the topic of disability closer to the top of the political and public agenda given 18.5% of Ireland's total population is disabled, according to studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Given the broad nature and complexity of issues contained within the motion, it is my intention to deal briefly with each, outlining the current situation, identifying the problem and putting forward a possible solution.  My colleague, Senator O'Donnell, will then deal with the outstanding matters during her contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">In order to bring about constructive reform to areas like disability services, it is imperative that the reforms introduced are as a result of research which is in the public domain to facilitate meaningful debate.  Therefore, it puzzles me greatly why the Government has introduced reforms and plans further changes in the coming months in areas relating to disability without publication of a value for money and policy review of disability services, commissioned originally in 2008.  It appears as if the Government is operating in a bubble — flying blind, so to speak.  We are told we have to wait until at least April for publication, despite the public consultation phase closing in early November last year.  Why is this the case?  I would doubt that it will grab as many headlines as other pending reports.  Perhaps the Minister of State present, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will explain the delay and go as far as giving us a publication date.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Let me give the House one simple reason that this report must be fast-tracked, namely, every day it is not published, the State is spending thousands of euro ineffectively and certainly not to the best benefit of disabled people.  Currently, almost 75% of all public moneys spent on disability go to service providers and not disabled people directly.  Before I continue, as I will be saying some fairly harsh things about service providers, I will acknowledge, without naming anyone, that there are some magnificent service providers in this country.  Let me get that on the table.  Nonetheless, it is truly shocking that 75% of the €1.5 billion spent goes to services and not to disabled people.  The waste of precious resources must be endless and the services being provided are far from perfect.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Take the case of the Tipperary family of which I spoke numerous times in this Chamber in the last session.  They are likely to lose their home this year due to cutbacks while struggling to support their severely disabled five-year old boy.  The HSE, in its wisdom, cannot find a paltry €300 a week to care for and support this child in its budget, leaving the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation to do the HSE's work for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Let me repeat it again for the Minister of State.  The Jack and Jill model of care would save the State millions of euro per year if it were adopted as Government policy.  The reason is that it is efficient and client-led.  That is only one small example of many where the State is not getting value for money in the disability arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Last week a mother told me about her intellectually disabled 38 year old daughter who was offered a day care placement five years ago, provided and paid for by the State.  The only problem was that the young lady in question did not want to go to the particular day care programme as she finds the subjects offered there completely boring.  They did not meet any of her needs or interests.  She has chosen to stay at home although the State has continued to pay the provider for her day care placement for the past five years.  The idea of a model, or of client-focused services, does not appear to be a culture which the State agencies seem willing to embrace.  Recently, a senior HSE official confirmed in writing that the HSE was not demand-led.  Please allow that statement to sink in.  The HSE is not demand-led.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">It is this attitude that leaves Ireland lagging behind when it comes to the provision of individualised services for disabled people.  If this country is to catch up with international best practice it is necessary for the Government to introduce a welfare system of individualised funding to give people with a disability and their families greater control of the services and allowances they receive from the State.  Given that according to the Department of Health, some €1.5 billion is spent on this area, nonetheless people using services have no say over what services they receive, where they receive them or who provides them.  Ultimately, disabled people are consumers like us all and they deserve the power of choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Individualised funding is a vision where the focus is on getting the person the right support to live the life he or she wants to live.  I do not believe this vision is unrealistic.  We should not stop until people with disabilities have the power of choice afforded to them.  The current system provides no meaningful choice for people with a disability and their families.  They are presented with a number of options — perhaps I should say boxes — which they must fit into and tick, with no appreciation of personal needs or individual circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Consider again the little boy from Tipperary, to whom I referred.  The HSE will offer him a place in a day or weekend respite service which he is not well enough to attend.  It refuses to offer him a home care package, in spite of medical evidence that shows he performs better in his home setting.  Under an individualised funding, this would be radically different.  The person would be placed at the centre of the plan.  In addition, he or she and the family would be invited to help in the drawing up of any service in which he or she was expected to participate.  In the case of this little boy, the family would be given the same level of funding by the HSE and would be tasked with sourcing the best service for their child that met his exact needs, thus allowing him to stay at home.  Imagine the sense of relief this would provide for that family.  Importantly, plans do not focus solely on what is already available.  Person-centred planning is about creating a life for a person, not merely a plan and a service.  It focuses on what could be provided and how to make it happen.  Simply because something is not available does not mean it could not be provided in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Recently, a person with a disability told me that a move towards individualised funding would allow those concerned to take control and provide a sense of freedom and excitement about their life, if they were to obtain the services that would allow them to participate fully in everything that interests them.  The words were, "At present I have no real say in my life and I must do what is prescribed by someone in an office who does not understand my individual needs and interests."  Nobody in this country should be made to feel like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The value for money and policy review of disability services in the public consultation phase seems to appreciate the need to adopt an individualised funding model.  Tonight I would like to hear from the Minister of State what the Government's views are on such a model, given that in its report on disability, published in 2011, the World Health Organization cited individualised funding was the approach to adopt when it came to disability funding.  Such a model has been introduced with great success in Northern Ireland, Britain, Canada and the United States, to name a few.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Participation and inclusiveness for all should be at the forefront of all Government policies and initiatives.  It was to my dismay, therefore, that I discovered that anybody who is in receipt of disability allowance is excluded from participating in the much heralded JobBridge labour activation measure, in spite of research published by the ESRI and the Office of Social Inclusion, which shows that two thirds of those surveyed were willing to work, given the correct supports.  I have yet to hear any Government representative satisfactorily explain the reason for this.  To the best of my knowledge, the defence is that it is acknowledged that a person in receipt of disability allowance may not be able to work and that is why it was not deemed an eligible payment.  It is certainly the case that some people receiving the allowance are unable to work.  However, it is also the case that the Government accepts that some of those in receipt of the payment are able to work as the disability allowance scheme allows a person in its receipt to earn up to €120 per week before it impacts on their payment.  There are a number of earning thresholds beyond that before a person becomes ineligible for the payment.  As Senators can see, the current defence does not hold water.  It borders on discrimination.  Legally, the Government will probably escape sanction as it will find a loophole in the terms and conditions drawn up for JobBridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">We are all familiar with the concept of poverty traps and why we should strive to prevent them.  I wish to bring a piece of research by the Central Statistics Office to the attention of Senators.  It shows that the number of people with disabilities living in consistent poverty has risen dramatically in recent years, from 8.8% in 2009 to 13% in 2010.  There are endless examples to which I could have pointed today that show how people with disabilities are getting a raw deal.  My colleague, Senator O'Donnell, will highlight the other issues contained in our motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">There are 750,000 people in Ireland with a disability or a mental health need.  Broken down, this amounts to 10.5% of adults and 8% of children.  This means that as we get older we are more likely to become disabled.  In other words, this is about protecting people from the cradle to the grave.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieLouiseODonnell" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Senator Marie-Louise O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_457">I am very pleased to second the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator O'Brien.  The motion recognises the need to protect and maintain disability services.  We need to do this in order to enhance the participation and inclusion of people with disabilities in Ireland.  I will speak in particular on two elements of the motion, the first being the Lunacy Regulation Act 1871.  It is astounding that this Act remains the governing legislation in this area.  The second element is the standard for residential services for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The motion calls on the Government to commit to speedily and immediately bringing a Bill before the Oireachtas to repeal and replace the Lunacy Regulation Act.  Many people may not be aware that this Act, long since outdated, still governs the adult wardship jurisdiction of the courts.  The need for appropriate and modern legislation on mental capacity applies, not only to persons with intellectual disabilities but potentially also to other categories of people, including those with acquired brain injury, dementia, and so on.  I am sorry to state that the approach of this Act to questions of capacity and disability is just as outdated as is its language.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">International best practice is to access capacity on a case by case basis.  This entails focusing on what is known as functional capacity, and assessing the person's capacity to understand the nature and consequences of a decision in the context of the choices available to him or her at a particular time.  Supported and assisted decision making is now best practice internationally, where necessary and where appropriate.  This is not the case in Ireland and we continue to operate primarily under the 1871 Act which provides only for general finding of incapacity, which then applies to every decision for the person in question and covers everything from decisions on living arrangements and property, capacity to enter into legal contracts and consent to medical treatment, etc.  This approach is not appropriate in a modern setting.  Our understanding of intellectual disability is no longer what it was in 1871 and it is time our legal framework caught up.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I am very pleased to see a reference in the programme for Government to reforming the law on mental capacity.  However, as we approach the first anniversary of the Government's term of office, it is time to convert that commitment into immediate action.  This is a very complex area but already there is considerable expertise available which could allow for speedy introduction of appropriate legislation.    The 2006 report of the Law Reform Commission on vulnerable people and the law contains many valuable recommendations which centre on the need for a modern system for guardianship or wardship of adults.  As a recently appointed Senator, I am conscious of the efforts made by Members in previous Seanads who twice sponsored Private Members' Bills on this topic.  These should be drawn on to finally repeal and replace a 140-year old law which is outmoded and outdated in its language and content.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">We have information that a large number of people, some of whom may be particularly vulnerable, are in full-time residential care paid for by the State but without any adequate or official inspection regime.  This is not acceptable.  We have been shocked at the abuses uncovered in the past in certain nursing homes, industrial schools and other residential settings.  Residential care homes cater for 8,000 adults and over 400 children with intellectual disabilities.  All these are well run institutions, staffed by hard-working, committed and caring professionals.  The crucial point, however, is the only way to ensure this is to have clear and appropriate standards for such residential services with an inspection framework to ensure they are upheld.  Outrage is useless after a difficulty or abuse is uncovered.  The only mature approach is to put an appropriate legal framework and inspection in place before the problem develops.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The programme for Government, to be fair, states standards for residential services for people with disabilities will be put on a statutory footing and be inspected by HIQA, the Health Information and Quality Authority.  It is time now to move on this.  I would, however, have expected concrete information on the fulfilment of this commitment at this stage.  What is the timeframe envisaged for the enactment of any legislation?  When can we hope inspections will begin?</p>
          <p eId="para_463">These are fundamental and profound human issues.  As an aunt of a disabled young man, I know this points to the very heart of who we are, as well as who we think we are, as they affect the vulnerable and persons with disabilities.  The issues raised in this motion are not affected by budgetary concerns or the ever present term "the current economic climate".  The need for repeal and replacement of the Lunacy (Regulation) (Ireland) Act 1871, of which I have spoken, is a perfect example of a practical measure which could do much to enhance the inclusion and participation in society for people with disabilities without any budgetary implications.  It is a simple question of demonstrating that we, as Senators and legislators, believe in the inherent value and dignity of all people, whether they have a disability.  I urge all Members to support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">acknowledges the significant measures the Department of Social Protection has in place to meet the employment-progression needs of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, back to the House.  She is a frequent visitor at this stage.  I commend the Independent Senators for tabling this Private Members' motion.  To a certain extent, they stole my thunder because my amendment is similar to the motion.  I had proposed Fine Gael would use its Private Members' time next week to table a similar motion.  I am delighted the Independent group has tabled it a week earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I acknowledge the remarkable work done by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien through the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation.  It is doing the work the Government should have done for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The annual spend on disability services now comes to €1.5 billion.  While this is an enormous resource, it has been poorly spent in the past.  The Government has not yet been in office for a year — the anniversary is approaching — and already the value for money audit on disability services is at an advanced stage.  Will the Minister of State give us an indication as to when we can expect its publication?  Some actions have been taken to deal with some of the issues that arose during this audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The largest problem with disability services is that there has been a proliferation of organisations working and advocating on behalf of people with disabilities.  Unfortunately, the massive resources made available in recent years have not got to the end-users to the degree we would have liked.  We need fundamental change in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Personalised budgeting for people with disabilities is a fundamental care plan which has worked elsewhere in Europe where introduced.  The Government intends to take this direction.  Unfortunately, it would have been useful if this had been introduced during the good days when massive resources were available.  That said, I must pay tribute to the former Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, John Moloney, who recognised money was wasted and instigated the value for money process which has been taken over by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  We are fortunate to have someone of her calibre heading up this sector.  She will take it inch by inch, row by row to ensure the money spent goes to the end-user.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Publication of the mental capacity Bill is imminent.  The Minister of State will probably update the House on its progress later.  This necessary and urgent legislation is long overdue and should have been introduced years ago.  While no further delay in its publication is acceptable, it is important we get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Over the weekend I attended a conference in Vienna on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It was fascinating to hear the difficulties experienced in some European countries in providing disability services along with examples of best practice in others.  While we have a long way to go to improving our provision of disability services, other countries experience similar problems.  Belgium has very good support structures for people with disabilities.  Up to 500,000 people there, however, are on waiting lists for personal assistance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I believe in integrated education.  The best way of fostering equality and opportunity is to have people with special needs attend school in a mainstream environment.  It is interesting to note that in Italy, 99.5% of people with special needs are in integrated education because the laws are in place to ensure it.  I would love if we could achieve the same.  We need to observe international best practices and implement them here.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Ireland is a caring and charitable nation.  However, charity and caring is not what people with disabilities require.  They need their rights recognised in legislation and through care packages such as personalised budgeting.  The programme for Government is committed to ensuring the lives of people with disabilities will improve and moneys for disability services will be spent wisely.  Adequate resources are provided but, unfortunately, their spending is not channelled correctly.  Instead, it is broken up all over the sector.  I have tried to get a handle on the amounts spent by various Departments but have only come up against brick walls.  This is why the value for money audit is critical.  That is why within a year of being in government, we have set a foundation.  What we need to do now is build on it and I have no doubt we will do that.  I am happy to propose the amendment because it reflects much of what is contained in the motion.</p>

          <from>Senator Marc MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_492">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank the Independent group for using Private Members' time to discuss this important issue.  I apologise for the absence of a number of my colleagues but there is an important funeral in Cork today.  There are not as many of us around for the debate but I would not like anybody to think that undermines the importance that our party attaches to this vital issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Like Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, I am not interested in scoring political points on this subject.  Reference was made to the contribution of former Minister of State, John Moloney, in the past and we would all like to get this issue right.  Everybody acknowledges there are difficulties and while there are many reasons for failure, there are no excuses.  That is why we must have an open mind in considering the best way to move the debate forward.  I will not list the measures Fianna Fáil implemented correctly over the years or what the Government has begun to do badly.  I fully support the concept of individualisation.  We must look to what might have been perceived once upon a time as non-essential charities and voluntary organisations run by business people such as the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation and examine the care model they have implemented in such a professional manner.  We must be prepared to learn from this.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">State institutions are often cumbersome and reluctant to accept the need for change.  Departments are like walls filled with pigeon holes similar to those via which our post is distributed and civil servants are unable to connect one pigeon hole to another.  That often contributes to preventing something that is simple and necessary from happening.  In 2007, Ireland signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This did not confer new rights; rather it reiterated existing rights and made it clear that such rights could no longer be ignored.  The heads of a mental capacity Bill were drawn up in 2008 based on a Law Reform Commission document on vulnerable adults produced in 2006 and, therefore, from the outset the scheme of the Bill was outdated, as it was based on this document and not on the UN convention to which Ireland had signed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I have been contacted by a number of interest groups and, as they have said, since it is 140 years since primary legislation was introduced in this area, we should be sure we get the update right.  Ireland's long-standing position on conventions such as this is that we ratify them after we have legislated and, therefore, to ratify this convention, legislation needs to pass through the Oireachtas.  However, there is little point in ushering in legislation that does not allow for ratification, as the proposed Bill threatened to do.  Legislation must adhere to the changes the convention sets out.  This would mean a move way from the stigmatisation associated with mental health issues.  We recently debated the incidence of suicide and mental health issues and the Minister of State has been very good to come to the House so often.  She is fast becoming the Martin Mansergh of this Administration.  For a period, he felt like he had never left the Seanad, even though he was a Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Senator Marc MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_497">During the debate on suicide, I highlighted an aspect of a Millward Brown poll of Deputies, which showed that more than 50% of them felt that anybody with a mental health issue should not have children.  I am sure if Senators were polled the outcome would not be as bad.  Other research confirms that Oireachtas Members and society generally have similar views of people with disabilities, which highlights the scale of the challenge we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Those of us who have businesses should think deeply about interviewing job applicants and what our attitude would have been to a person with a permanent disability.  I am not sure how honest we are with ourselves if we think about this privately among ourselves.  People who do not have a disability need to be educated.  To give a lead to the private sector, when young people with disabilities leave college, the public sector should guarantee them an internship immediately in the field in which they are qualified to gain valuable experience, which would give them assistance in securing private sector employment.  This proposal should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I agree with individual funding.  Disability organisations need money to fund jobs, offices, marketing and advertising.  People with disabilities are seen as cash cows by some organisations.  I do not say that their intentions are not good but they are swallowing up significant resources unnecessarily.  Fianna Fáil supports the motion, as we are all focused on trying to make improvements and a positive contribution in this area.</p>

          <from>Senator Mary Moran</from>
          <p eId="para_500">I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  She has been a great source of information and she is always been approachable when we have questions.  I highly commend the motion and Government Members are in difficult position, given an amendment has been tabled, but there is not much difference between them.  The bottom line is we all want to do away with the stigma associated with disability services and all want to improve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The lunacy Bill that was published was atrocious and I speak as the mother of a 14 and a half year old boy with a moderate intellectual disability.  My hackles are immediately raised if anybody brings up that word.  I have been out with my son and people have asked me his age.  I tell them to ask him.  To put it in Dundalk language, he is a wee dote, as are all children.  A total of 18.5% of the population has a physical or intellectual disability and we must look after them.  I acknowledge the presence of Ms Deirdre Carroll from Inclusion Ireland and others from Amnesty International who are in the Visitors' Gallery and I thank them for coming to the House.  I was fortunate to receive a nomination from Inclusion Ireland to run for the Seanad, which is probably why I am so nervous today.  We have to get it right.  I am not worried about that, however, because I know the Minister of State is the right woman for the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The quicker we can complete the value for money review, the quicker we can act.  We have to ensure funding goes to the people with disabilities who need the money.  As a parent and having been involved with various disability groups in my own area of County Louth, more than anything I want people to be given a choice.  I do not want my son to be put somewhere unsuitable when he finishes school at the age of 18.  I want him to be able to do something constructive.  Yesterday, I visited the cúltaca project group, which is part of the Netwell Centre in Dundalk.  The group supports assisted living with high powered technology, which gives people a sense of independence.  Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i> included a copy of the excellent magazine, <i>Insight</i>, which reiterated what each of us have said in regard to disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Individual budgets that allow services to be tailored to people's needs and a specific minder to be designated are the way we should proceed.  One of the biggest challenges I faced when my son turned three was accessing information.  I had to continue with my life and work.  I often felt that I could cope with disability and whatever else is thrown at me but I needed to access services.  A significant amount of money is wasted by service providers because the money is not invested where it is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">It is vital that inspections are carried out.  We have seen the reports.  My son uses respite services and I would be lost without them.  I have other children who are taking examinations.  Inspections are necessary because children do not always understand the problems that arise or else they cannot communicate or report them.  I know the Minister of State is working on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">We must not forget that every person with a disability is unique.  We need to tailor services to individuals' needs.  I acknowledge Inclusion Ireland has been working on this for the past ten years.  We must also work with HIQA on individual inspection reports and the quicker we implement them, the better.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">I do not know why the Opposition amendment was tabled.  There is no need for an amendment to this motion, which Senator Mary Ann O'Brien drafted so effectively.  It stands on its own and it should be supported.  In the 19 years I have been a Member of this House, I have invariably found that Governments felt they had to introduce amendments which start with "delete all words after".  There is hope but hope is often in our own hands.  We must recognise that individuals who are sometimes cast aside because of disability also have considerable ability if we help them find it.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">My company had a policy of employing a number of people who would otherwise not have been employed.  It was a joy to see such individuals suddenly succeed.  The mother of one young man who was employed to wheel trolleys from the car park approached us to argue that he was capable of doing far more than that.  For two years he did nothing but wheel trolleys but he blossomed and grew once he had colleagues who were prepared to help him.  His colleagues also blossomed and grew because they saw somebody who was given a task — I think it was the fruit and vegetable department — which he was suddenly able to perform.  We can do far more if we trust people.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">For the past five years I have been patron of the Irish Association of Supported Employment, in which regard I saw the same thing.  We have to spell out to employers that they can do more if they have confidence in people.  On one occasion when we were opening a new supermarket, a young woman with one arm was among those who applied for a job.  She had a lovely personality and the store manager suggested that she could work at the check out because, whereas in the old days staff had to handle the goods with their left hand and ring up the prices on the cash register with the other, only one hand is needed since the advent of scanning.  We employed her and she was so successful that she stayed with us for at least two years before getting a job in a local flower shop which she now manages.  It is possible for us to do things but we must have confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Between one in five and one in six people have long-term disabilities, most of which are acquired through the life course rather than present from birth.  Many of these individuals have major difficulties performing everyday activities according to the report, Social Portrait of People with Disabilities in Ireland, which was published last year.  We can do far more.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The motion deserves our attention.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities aims to shift society's treatment of people with disabilities from a charitable perspective to being based on rights and inclusion.  We need to sent that message not only to the Government but also to the entire nation.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Senator David Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I commend Senators Mary Ann O'Brien and O'Donnell for their passionate advocacy of one of the most important issues facing this country.  It is notable that they were among the imaginative nominations by the Taoiseach but they have the courage to speak out independently.  Nothing could offer greater justification for the continuation of this Seanad in whatever form it may take.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I was moved by the story of the boy in Tipperary, although I have heard it previously.  It is a disgrace that his parents lost their home, particularly given that we approach the 100th anniversary of 1916.  I will not rehearse those phrases.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">People with disabilities have every right to be angry.  I have also worked with Inclusion Ireland, which I salute as a remarkable organisation.  I was horrified to learn that the Lunacy Act is still in force.  I ask the Minister of State to give her commitment that she will remove that Act from the Statute Book.  Such language is offensive to these people.  I recall a period when we were going through legislation to remove that kind of language.  Let us make a commitment on this tonight if we do nothing else.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I regret there are two amendments.  I do not know why they were tabled because it should be obvious that the motion is justified.  People with disabilities want the equality which the foundation documents of this republic promised.  They do not want reliance on charity.  They want what they are entitled to, which is the opportunity to live independently.  The Minister promised a mental capacity Bill.  I would like to know where it is, how it is going, when we will get it, and whether it will be introduced through this House.  We have people here who have demonstrated they are absolutely qualified to deal with it.  It is wonderful that people such as Senator O'Brien and her husband, in the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, have done this remarkable work.  They should not have to do it.  They were placed in that situation, but they have done it.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I remember, when some of the earlier legislation was being discussed, my then colleague Senator Joe O'Toole and I fought against another Government to achieve rights-based legislation, but we could not.  Even in those good days, the justification was the economy.  If we wait for the economy to be right, we will never do it.  One of the proudest and most positive moments of my life was being asked to present an award at the O<sub>2</sub> Ability Awards — not disability awards.  So many employers spoke there about how wonderful their employees who were disabled in one way or another were because of their immense commitment to the job.  That is what makes it so mean and so awful that they are excluded from this job access programme.  They should be encouraged rather than stymied, because it is good for their mental welfare, it is good for the education of the people who work with them, and it is good for business.  Businesses are run by pretty hard-headed people.  Senator Quinn was one of the major supporters and he received an award that night.  He is a decent man but a hard-headed businessman.  People like that would not employ people with disabilities if they did not get damned good value out of them, and we in Seanad Éireann must assist in every way we possibly can.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I listened in horror to a story on the radio in the last couple of days.  A young woman who had a progressive illness that resulted in disability had lost her medical card through a kind of computer error, and she was told that despite this, she would have to go back to the start and apply for another one.  As she did not have her drugs, she was confined to bed unnecessarily.  She had to go through the rigmarole of applying for another card and was told it would take six months.  Can this not be short-circuited?  Can we not support people with disabilities?</p>

        <speech by="#JillianVanTurnhout" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Senator Jillian van Turnhout</from>
          <p eId="para_519">I welcome John Dolan from the Disability Federation of Ireland, as well as the aforementioned people.  I would like to focus in my statement on what I believe are three fundamental failings in the provision of disability support services.  One is that there are no independent inspections; the second is that the €1.5 billion of health budget spent on disability services is allocated to service providers rather than individuals; and the third is Ireland's current capacity laws, which date back to 1871.  Each of these is totally unacceptable and leads one to question what we have learned from our egregious failings towards vulnerable groups in State care in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">We can all agree that the only way to ensure we never repeat our past failings is to understand why they happened and for current and future policy to embrace what we learned.  This is exactly what the recent Amnesty International report, In Plain Sight, responding to the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports, sought to achieve.  Its aim was encapsulated by its executive director, Colm O'Gorman, when he said "The past only becomes history once we have addressed it, learnt from it and made the changes necessary to ensure that we do not repeat mistakes and wrongdoing."  In fact, the report identified a number of causal and contributory factors to the institutional abuse of children in State and church-run institutions, which unfortunately I see as being equally valid in today's debate: the absence of a voice, the absence of statutory inspections, deference, and the failure of the State to operate on behalf of the people and not interest groups.  While the debate we are having is in the context of disability supports and services, it is not really about disability — it is about justice, equality and human rights for all citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">With regard to the regulation and inspection of disability services, recommendation 11 of the Ryan report implementation plan states that independent inspections are essential.  I will quote from the implementation plan, but I will take the liberty of substituting the word "children" with "people with disabilities".</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_522">All services for [people with disabilities] should be subject to regular inspections in respect of all aspects of their care. The requirements of a system of inspection include the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_523">There is a sufficient number of inspectors.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_524">The inspectors must be independent.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_525">There should be objective national standards for inspection of all settings where [people with disabilities] are placed.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_526">Unannounced inspection should take place.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_527">Complaints to an inspector should be recorded and followed up.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_528">Inspectors should have power to ensure that inadequate standards are addressed without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We are all aware of the commitment in the programme for Government, which we welcome, to put the draft national standards on a statutory footing.  In fact, the second progress report on the Ryan report implementation plan, which was published last year, notes that a new target date of the fourth quarter of 2012 has been set.  The report also notes that the commencement of the Health Act 2007 by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to allow the independent registration and inspection of all residential centres and respite services for children with disabilities is contingent on the aforementioned action being taken.  We still have not learned from our past and we still do not have the required systems in place.  When will the Minister be in a position to give the necessary mandate and legal power to HIQA to inspect the centres?</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In my research I was appalled to find that there had been no official audit of the number and location of centres; therefore, we actually do not know where all the centres are and who is running them.  I hope the Minister of State can show me evidence that this is not right.  I also ask the Minister of State to explain why interim measures such as instructing the HSE and social services inspectorate to commence inspections of centres where children or those with disabilities live have not been put in place until an inspection regime is operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The second issue I want to discuss is the individual resource allocation system.  Everyone agrees that we need to provide an individualised budget.  We have spoken in the past about deference to the State and the church, but what about the deference that people in receipt of disability services are forced to pay to the HSE and service providers in circumstances in which they are unable to question or provide any input into the services they receive, where they receive them or who provides them?  I have heard of cases in which an individual has chosen not to avail of a service, yet the State makes payments to the service provider, so the State is paying for a service that is not being accessed.  It does not make sense.  As the system operates, it seems that people with disabilities are expected to feel lucky and grateful for the supports and services they receive.  The supports and services are provided by the State because we value all citizens.  We recognise that we have different needs at different stages of our lives, and our system should reflect this.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">We are all aware of and welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce modern capacity legislation.  I will not rehearse what has already been said, but I will give a quote from one of our briefings which clearly shows why the law is so archaic.  Frieda Finlay, chairperson of Inclusion Ireland, described the situation of herself and her daughter.  She said: "As the parent of a 38 year old woman with an intellectual disability, who is a citizen by birth of an independent sovereign republic, I burn with anger every day at the thought that her capacity to make basic decisions about her life is governed by an Act signed into law by Queen Victoria and brought in by Gladstone's Government 140 years ago."  The failure to repeal this law flies in the face of Ireland's commitment to the right of all people in Ireland to live with dignity and exercise self-determination.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">We all know what needs to be done.  What we do not need is more reports; we do not even need more debates.  We do not need pilot projects or think tanks.  We need action and implementation.  That is the reason for my disappointment that amendments have been tabled by both the Government and Sinn Féin.  I urge my colleagues not to push them to a vote.  The original motion that was tabled should be a catalyst for change.  Let us show this to be a Seanad motion.  It does not have to be an Independent group motion.  Let us collect around this motion and make it a Seanad motion, and let us show a strong sign of unity.  That is what I urge my colleagues to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarieMoloney" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Senator Marie Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I welcome all those in the Visitors Gallery.  I also welcome the Minister of State.  Yesterday I drove four hours from Killarney to attend a briefing by Inclusion Ireland.  It was one of the most informative briefings I have attended to date.  The issues that were raised at the briefing are some of the most important I have heard regarding people with disabilities and, for once, it was not all about money.  It was about equality and fairness, and the right of people with disabilities to be treated with due respect and as an equal. Is that too much for someone to ask for in life?</p>
          <p eId="para_535">We should focus not on the "dis" in disabilities, but on the word "ability" that is contained in the word "disability".  We should focus on the ability of people with disabilities — on what they can do and achieve.  Just because a person has a disability it does not mean he or she is on the scrapheap, or cannot think and speak for himself or herself.  Of course some people have a profound disability and cannot speak for themselves, and it is incumbent on us to speak up for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I had many items I would like to address but five or six minutes does not cover it.  One of the most disturbing things I heard yesterday and it made me emotional when I heard it was one woman telling us the story of her daughter, who is officially known in this country as an "idiot" under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.  How heartbreaking is it for any parent to hear that?  This Act, introduced under British rule, is nothing short of an insult to people with intellectual disabilities and must change.  That any human being can be diagnosed as an idiot or a lunatic is a disgrace and reflects badly on successive governments.  I do not blame any one party because we are all to blame and this should have been addressed long before now.  This is a dated and antiquated Act and I commend the Minister of State for the proposals to introduce the mental incapacity Bill.  It cannot be put on the backburner and must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Yesterday I was advised of a person who had being using the services of an organisation but is no longer availing of these services.  However, the money continues to be paid to the service provider even though the HSE has been advised on numerous occasions that the person is no longer using the service.  We should consider something similar to the proposed health insurance for all whereby the money follows the patient and not the service.  In this case the money should follow the person with the disability in order that he or she can use whatever services are of value to help the person with his or her disability and provide a superior standard of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I welcome that the Minister of State is carrying out the value for money review of the disability services.  We need to know that the services being provided meet the objectives of the person with the disability.  I add my voice to commend the former Minister of State, John Moloney, for instigating this review.  I know the Minister of State will continue it and see it through.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I commend the Independent group of Senators for tabling the motion which allows us to have an open and frank debate on the matter.  Although I agree with the sentiment of the motion I will be voting for the Government's amendment for two reasons.  First, the Government must not rush this through.  Proper legislation must be put in place and as someone said yesterday having no law is better than having bad law.  I am allowing the Minister of State time to deal with the issue properly, but deal with it she must.  Second, if I voted against the amendment I would lose the party whip, be expelled from the parliamentary party and find myself on the outside looking in.  I want to be attending the parliamentary party meetings to keep the issue on the agenda and I will be doing that.  At the end of the 24th Seanad if I have been instrumental in any way in bringing about change in this insulting Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871, I will feel my time in the Seanad was worthwhile.</p>

        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Senator Denis O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I support the motion tabled by the Independent Senators whom I compliment on such an appropriate motion.  I am reminded of a song about the 1913 lock-out led by James Connolly which referred to giving little in case they would ask for more.  The disability area has been neglected for years.  I accept that some progress has been made in the past 20 years but it has been insufficient legislatively or financially.  I live in Bantry, next door to CoAction West Cork, which started off as St. Joseph's.  The Minister of State is aware of the facility which she visited recently.  In my first local authority election campaign in 1985, I visited the house of a family I knew well.  Being anxious to get into the house and perhaps being somewhat nosey, I saw an adult in a pram — someone who had never been exposed to the public.  Whether that was through embarrassment or a stigma, that person never saw the light of day and died many years ago.  It was a frightening scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">When St. Joseph's started in Bantry it was completely voluntary for many years and it raised money through collections and so on.  It expanded its services and now between young people and adults it probably has 300 clients.  CoAction has gone into the Beara Peninsula and throughout west County Cork.  It is covering areas out to which COPE was not able to reach.  Approximately 15 or 20 years ago when feelers were put out to establish whether there were any people with disabilities in the Beara Peninsula, initially nobody came forward.  However, when it provided a service, all of a sudden 26 adult people were in the loop.  It shows that we have come from an intolerable situation in the 1970s and early 1980s and much progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Senator Moloney referred to the legislative changes and I accept what she said in good faith regarding that.  However, there is a question about funding for people with disability.  They have been neglected historically by several governments, including those involving my party going way back.  We must ensure there will be no rowing back in funding.  We have made progress on an issue from a zero start.  It is critical for the Minister to take to Cabinet that what is being given by way of financial services to groups representing people with disabilities must be not alone maintained but also expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I note Senator Moloney's fears about not supporting the motion tabled by the Independent Senators.  She gave two reasons, one being her fear of losing the whip.  I lost the whip on two occasions in my political lifetime.  The outcome was that it garnered me great respect within my party and for a change I called its bluff.  When I was on the Government side of the House I had no problem taking on Ministers who were party colleagues on a number of occasions, whether it was parochial issues to do with Bantry Hospital or fisheries.  During debates on Bills covering fisheries and harbour boards I tabled a substantial number of amendments against a Minister from my party, which in the past 12 months has not happened with the Government side.  Sometimes that must be done — Members need to show their mettle and take them on.  While I understand her reservations, if Senator Moloney is serious about an issue, there is nothing shameful from time to time in taking on her own party and standing up, in this case, on an issue on disability if she feels strongly about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Unfortunately I was unable to attend yesterday's briefing for a number of reasons — the Seanad was not sitting and I had to attend a funeral in Cork last night, which would have entailed travelling to Dublin and then going back down.  I am probably living further from the capital than Senator Moloney.</p>

If she is to be criticised, I will be vocal in that regard, but I will not do so tonight.  I hope she will take on board what is being said here.  The Independent Senators must be given credit for what they are doing.

          <p eId="para_547">I support the Independent Senators on the other side for the work they put into this and support what we have heard from the Government benches, from Senator Conway and his colleagues.  I am not skilled in matters of procedure, but No. 19 on the Order Paper is a Bill on fiscal responsibility put forward by me.  When I put that Bill forward, the Leader said he would adjourn it and keep it on the Order Paper with two minutes pending.  The Government should not vote down this motion and if the same formula as used for my Bill can be used to keep this issue alive, it should be used.  I am not aware of the technicalities, but that formula keeps an issue alive and the Government does not need to vote it down.  We can then keep an eye on the legislation coming forward from the Government to ensure it complies with what the Independent Senators have said.  This is what I would like to see happen as I would not like the Government to vote down this proposal, which has been put together very skilfully and has also been skilfully argued on the Government side.  Senator Conway needs no introduction on this issue and the account given by Senator Moran about going to Dundalk with her son was deeply moving. How could people who spoke so willingly on this issue vote down the motion?  They should be offered the same formula as was offered to me if it is available.  The Cathaoirleach is in the House longer than I am and could inform us whether it is possible to adjourn this and leave it on the Order Paper with time pending in order that the Independent Senators can watch what the Government does in response.</p>

          <from>Senator Katherine Zappone</from>
          <p eId="para_548">I welcome the Minister of State to the House again.  I thank and acknowledge the leadership of Senator Mary Ann O'Brien in our group in terms of this issue and her passion for it and thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for supporting her.  In fact, all of us in the group are involved in putting the motion forward as we all believe it is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I agree with Senator Quinn on the question of the need for an amendment to this motion.  As Senator van Turnhout asked, why should it not be a Seanad motion?  Senator Barrett has just asked the same question.  In support of this, I have questions for the Minister of State.  I know she is committed to this issue but so are these women and this man.  I understand the Minister of State needs to stay with her party and I agree that is as it should be.  However, our focus is on inclusion and participation and it is on that our motion is based.  The Government focus in its amendment is on the budgetary and fiscal situation.  However, with our focus on inclusion and participation, we also recognise the economic climate.  The Government focus starts out with the budgetary and fiscal situation, although it does include support for people with disability.  Our focus on inclusion and participation is the focus required with regard to pushing forward a rights-based approach and this is something I know the Minister of State would agree with, as would all of us in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">A rights-based approach to inclusion and participation is important across the life cycle, for babies, children and older people.  I hope we will all become older people, but as many of us know, we are more than likely to have a disability when we become older.  Therefore, this is about us, although some of us have a disability younger.  Our focus is on a sense of urgency.  We want to see more movement sooner.  The focus of the Government amendment is, as I read it, "steady as she goes".  It is not that the Government disagrees with us, but it just wants to keep the same steady line.  Our focus is on publishing the value for money report and reviewing the disability services, but the Government focus is on pointing out how great it is for being committed to this issue.  We focus on the need for a reformed rights-based way forward, but the Government focus in its conclusion is that there is no need for change because everything is going okay.</p>

It is clear that while both the motion and amendment share common ground and are largely in agreement, the focus of our motion has more to do with inclusion and participation, as sense of urgency and a rights-based approach.</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I warmly commend all of the Independent Senators who sponsored this motion.  We would certainly have given the motion our support, with the exception of the line "despite essential cutbacks required in the current economic climate".  This was an area of concern.  In the spirit of what has been proposed by the Independent Senators, we have no difficulty with agreed Seanad motions, particularly on issues as important as this.  Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned, that we should ask for the support of other groups and for the names of those Senators to be attached to motions.  We would certainly have supported this motion and our amendment was in that vein and was submitted due to the language used in one paragraph of the motion.  We were not against the substance of the motion at all as it is an excellent motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I welcome to the Visitors Gallery members from Inclusion Ireland, Amnesty International and a number of other advocacy organisations.  I was unable to attend the briefing given by Inclusion Ireland, but was sent a copy of its presentation which puts into context what this motion is about.  It stated that the thinking and philosophy around the area of disability has changed significantly over the past ten years, but services have not moved on.  The current system is expensive and inflexible and the person or his or her family does not get to have much say in how the money is spent or to have a choice of service provider.  Perhaps more important, the money is attached to the service, not the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Like Senator Zappone, I agree that the Government amendment is about aspiration whereas the motion tabled by the Independent Senators and the Sinn Féin amendment calls for a number of changes.  These call for the publication of the value for money and policy review of disability services.  What is wrong with that?  Our amendment calls for best practice in terms of how money is spent in the disability services area.  What is wrong with that?  It cites a weakness in the labour activation measure announced by the Department of Social Protection.  Even Government Members should agree with that.  It calls for the bringing forward of a legal capacity Bill and the putting in place of modern capacity legislation.  What is wrong with that?  It calls for the putting in place of the national standards for residential services for people with disabilities and for putting these on a statutory footing.  It also calls for proper, independent inspections.  Therefore, the motion and our amendment call on the Government to do what we all believe the Government should do in the area of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The main reason we cannot support the Government amendment is that it states we should recognise that some reductions in disability services will be unavoidable and welcomes the aim of the HSE to tailor such reductions in a way which minimises the impact on service users and their families as much as possible.  I do not believe that cuts to services for people with disabilities are unavoidable or acceptable.  Far from it.  They are unacceptable and must be avoided.  That is what the Government should be ensuring.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Apart from the proposals in the motion and our amendment, I ask the Minister of State to consider the following.  I call for the Minister to review the current Act as it relates to people with disabilities.  My party fully supports a rights-based disability Act.  I was in the Visitors Gallery when the Disability Act 2005 was brought in and was struck by the huge number of advocacy organisations and people with disabilities there who were not happy with the legislation being introduced.  As legislators, we were bringing in legislation for people with disabilities with which people were unhappy.  In fact, the Labour Party and Fine Gael voted against it at the time because they too wanted rights-based legislation.  It is high time that when we, as legislators, introduce Bills we are conscious of the people who will be most affected and must avail of the services in question and that we ensure they are put at the centre of the legislation.  Unfortunately, that does not always happen.  There is also a need for robust enforcement mechanisms and the establishment of a new national disability strategy with real targets.  One can put in place a number of documents and a strategy but setting the targets is what is important.  We support the appointment of a disability ombudsman in the Department of the Taoiseach.  We are putting forward clear proposals in order to be helpful to the Minister and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I warmly congratulate the Independent Senators for tabling this motion.  I acknowledge the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who has been in the Seanad for a number of very important debates, such as the debate on suicide, on carers and related issues.  If we are to achieve all-party consensus, it can be given only when we have rights based legislation for people with disabilities.  Neither my party nor I will be able to support anything short of that.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
          <p eId="para_559">I am anxious to listen to as many members as possible, but I am equally anxious to ensure there is a right of reply, when I sit down.  There is not much difference between us; it is a matter of emphasis, as some have pointed out. I am not in the business of telling people how to vote except, of course, when I am asking them to vote for me in a general election. It is really irrelevant how the vote goes tonight because we will do what we will do. Having listened to the contributions of all Members tonight, we are all singing from the same hymn sheet. We are all convinced that the way forward for people with a disability is on an entirely different path from what obtained in the past. I am convinced of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I apologise to the officials who have written an exceptional speech, which I read, but most of which I will not use.  Many names were mentioned but let me take the opportunity to mention Mr. John Dolan, chief executive of the Disability Federation of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Issues must be dealt with but the debate has highlighted the need for a radical change in how people with disabilities are allowed to live in the same space we live in.  We have put so many barriers in their way, they cannot participate fully, whether in education or in services.  I am not inclined to refer to the health service when I talk about disability.  People with disabilities tell me they are not sick.  They have been defined by a medical model as people who are sick, but they are not sick.  One particular man who lives a very independent life says to me that he is not sick, but when he is sick he will go to this doctor, who will admit him to hospital if he is very ill.  How we define people with a disability is very important.  What is critical is the introduction of radical change.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">When I addressed my first conference as the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I was asked by a member of the audience to state what I hoped to achieve in the area of disability.  I rattled off my list, standards, legislation and individualised budgeting.  As I left the podium, the person organising the conference stated that I would never see them.  The value for money audit, which was initiated by the then Minister of State, the former Deputy John Moloney, is almost completed and will be published in the near future.  That will tell us where, on whom and on what we are spending our money.  The individualised budgeting will follow from the value for money review.  We have a policy group working on it even though it has not been completed and it is not published.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">We must ask people with disabilities how they want to spend their day.  I listened to a most incredible man, Mr. Tom Shakespeare, last week at the launch of the World Health Organization's report on disability.  I said I would buy his name from him because it is invaluable in terms of politics.  He said that when one is dealing with people with disabilities, one must ensure they are educated more than anybody else, because they will never be able to do the physical work that others are able to do.  I am not solely responsible for the delivery of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">It is proposed to publish the legislation this session.  However if we are serious about the use of language, and I think language is very powerful, should the proposed legislation be entitled the mental capacity Bill?  Should we even be using the term "mental capacity"?  I know the thought of reviving that argument, with the possibility of delaying the Bill sends a shiver up everyone's back.  Should we be talking instead about assisted citizenship?  Should we get away from the concept of graduated capacity, with able bodied people having full capacity but others having graduated levels of capacity.  Should we think in terms of all people being equal citizens, with some people needing additional supports to access that citizenship?  Are we prepared to delay the legislation to get that right?</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I am not certain of the response to that question.  On the one hand, people will say, publish and be damned, others would see it as magnificent to be a world leader by 2016, the centenary of 1916.  If we are to have a serious debate, other issues need to be looked at, such as individualised budgeting.  There are certain organisations that have skilled their people to roll with this now, and are doing it anyway because they are taking portions of the block grant, and asking their clients what they want to do and how they want to live independently.  The idea that the Department of Health would be solely responsible for people with disability is ridiculous.  Where do people with disabilities live, if they want to live independently?  Surely that is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This applies to services such as transport, education, social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The disability strategy group was always at the centre of government but was so limited it was worrying.  The advice was to consider getting rid of it, but I said no to that suggestion and decided to put people, who have lived with disability on to the group and deal with each Department individually, asking its representatives to tell the group what it is doing in relation to the service for people with a disability.  That is the focused approach we are bringing to bear.  We have now for the first time, the city and county managers in the group, because they are decision makers; for example, it is they who make decisions on public lighting, footpaths, public seating, the location of the bus stop and so on.  It is not rocket science — we can send people to Mars, yet are we saying we cannot do this.  Of course, we can do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I do know the reason it takes hours and hours of professional involvement to tell a mother her child needs a speech therapist, or hours of professional involvement to tell her a child needs an occupational therapist when the child cannot sit properly.  We must stop spending money in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I am not a person who bashes service providers.  They did a job when the State refused to do it.  The State paid for it but they did the job the State was not prepared to do.  Times have moved on and now we must accept that things will be done differently.   Service providers will continue to be required to deliver their service, within budget, to those who wish to access them.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Was it the women's movement which first argued that if one is serious about equality, one must become blind to gender?  Perhaps we must become blind to disability, while fully accepting that certain people need help to access services and the necessary social supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The capacity Bill will not be cost neutral as we will have to establish what will be known as a circle of support.  We will have guardianships and will not always rely on families because they will not always be around.  The ward of court system is outdated, expensive and cumbersome and should have been abolished years ago.  This legislation will abolish it and guardians will be appointed instead.  We will also have a guardianship office because safeguards will be required to ensure complaints can be made when guardians fail to do their jobs properly or in respect of decisions, whether assisted or otherwise, which they take in tandem with the person with the disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Capacity is a peculiar thing.  We are told we make most of the important decisions in life in a split second.  I do not know about Senators but I have made some big mistakes in my time.  Why on earth do we believe that people with disabilities do not have the capacity to make decisions about their relationships, lives and medical conditions, where they wish to live or whether they wish to have children or make a will?  Some people will require a great deal of assistance to make such decisions while others will need very little assistance.  I know a young woman with an intellectual disability who could mind mice at a crossroads.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The assumption that we are all the same is wrong.  What I have said is not vague or aspirational.  The Bill and value for money report will be published in this session and individualised budgeting will be introduced.  While it will not be for everyone, anyone who is interested in being involved will receive every assistance necessary to do so.  It is important to be part of the mainstream and be able to do things such as add one's name to a local authority housing list.  This will not be cost neutral but the substantial budget available to us will be spent in a different and more focused manner.  We should take to heart the saying, "Nothing about us without us", which is often used by people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">There are far too many organisations representing people with disabilities.  They need to be streamlined because the notion that every one of these organisations needs an administration backroom is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">While I do not believe there is much separating me and the Opposition, I will not tell Senators how to vote.  I appreciate having opportunities to speak in this House on subjects about which I and Senators clearly feel passionately.  I once turned down a request that I run for the Seanad when I lost my seat.  Perhaps this is my punishment.  I thank Senators for listening to me.  The plans I have outlined are not aspirational but will be implemented.  They are radical and different and will meet opposition from different quarters.  With determination, I hope we will succeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">There is an old adage in show business that the act subsequent to a stunning performance usually starts with the words, "Follow that".  I feel like such a performer taking to the stage after the Minister of State's speech.  As a parent of a child with special needs who has listened to the debate and the Minister of State's impassioned, committed and sincere approach to this issue, I would not contemplate having a vote.  I have always taken the view that politics should not enter issues of disability.  This is also the message the Minister of State has conveyed.  There will always be arguments about whether resources are adequate and various other issues which arise in the context of the motion.  The Minister of State is correct that the speech written by her officials, which I have read, is comprehensive and focused and reflects the views she expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I compliment the Minister of State on a report which was carried in the national media on a response from Rehab to an initiative she took, with her Government colleagues, to restore the allowance to people with disabilities who are working.  I presume the measure will all also apply to those engaged in the national learning centres.  Senator Moran and I are both parents of children with a unique genetic disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome, which is primarily though not exclusively an eating disorder.  To put the matter bluntly, if sufferers of the syndrome, for which there is no cure, are not supervised, they will effectively eat themselves to death.  This brings its own particular challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">My daughter, Siobhan, attends a national learning centre in Manorhamilton which has been a lifeline for her and many others.  In the context of the Minister of State's remarks on the Department of Social Protection monitoring and following up on those who are retraining, the national learning centres have an exemplary record in this regard.  Almost all of those who go through the system find meaningful employment, which is an extraordinary compliment to the whole concept.  Obviously, the Minister of State has a particular interest in ensuring the restoration of the €10 or €12 that was being docked.  I compliment her on achieving this objective as it is one of the little issues which pop up from under the radar from time to time.  While the reduction received front page headlines, the restoration did not receive equal coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The Minister of State is correct on how the Health Service Executive deals with people with disabilities.  I am sure Senator Moran will not mind me pointing out that a comparison of the treatment she has received to date for her teenage son in the north east with the treatment we, as parents, received in the north west would lead one to believe that she and I lived in two different countries.  When the Senator heard about the services and support networks to which my daughter had access and the proactive approach of the HSE in my area, she could not quite believe we were living in the same country.  While I do not wish to speak for the Senator, her experience was the opposite of ours.  My family has been fortunate in respect of the services provided by the State since the time Siobhan was first diagnosed.  Incidentally, she was diagnosed with the condition within three weeks of birth in Holles Street Hospital following a genetic test, whereas it was several years before Senator Moran's child was diagnosed.  Prader-Willi syndrome is a rare condition which creates a mild handicap.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Minister of State is correct to state that one must address the number of experts involved in assessments.  In our case, it was a simple genetic test done in Holles Street Hospital, whereas Senator Moran did not have that.  There were many other things which were comparative.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Minister of State said that HSE managers will have the scope within the national figure of 3.7% to vary the level of reduction which will apply to individual service providers and that the aim of the HSE will be to tailor such reductions in a way which minimises the impact on service users and their families as much as possible.  I am sure she is more aware than I am that families are very concerned because of the current economic situation we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">In HSE North West, formerly the North Western Health Board, the main driver was a now retired senior civil servant called Pat Dolan, who headed up the disability services there.  He only retired in the past year or 18 months.  I was concerned when he was retiring because I knew how committed and passionate he was about what he was doing.  I was concerned that he would be replaced by somebody who would be less effective and less committed and who would treat the job as such whereas he went the extra mile.  I am sure the Minister of State has discovered that all those working in the State sector and involved with disabilities go the extra mile because they are all very committed but perhaps I am being a little unfair to his successor.  I do not mean to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I hope the Minister of State will continue to monitor this to ensure there is the minimum reduction.  Every euro taken from the disability sector has a far greater ripple effect than perhaps it would in any other area.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will do so in light of the fact she looked after the minutiae of the allowance which was removed in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I am not being political but the Minister of State referred to her predecessor, John Moloney, in regard to the national disability strategy which she inherited and has committed herself to implementing not only today but on previous occasions in this House.  Like the Minister of State, I pay warm tribute to John Moloney.  I am very happy the Minister of State has been given this job.  Her predecessor was totally committed to it from the day he took it on and she is equally committed.  I have every confidence, even with all the problems in the economic field, given that we have a doughty a fighter as the Minister of State.  I have known her for a long time and we have worked together in a variety of different guises.  I am so pleased she has taken on this brief in the manner she has.  Given her background in opposition, she was well prepared coming in to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Notwithstanding that, in some instances, Ministers of State in Administrations prior to this one sometimes settled into a comfort zone and were happy to turn up and listen to what the officials said.  She is the complete opposite of that and I thank God on behalf of the parents of those with special needs that she is in this position.  I wish her Godspeed.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Senator Paul Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_586">I welcome the Minister of State.  I am sure she is pleased that for the second time in a week she has been described as a doughty fighter but we will leave it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome the motion and congratulate those who tabled it. The Minister of State's words were inspirational and the work she has done in this field since assuming this position of responsibility is laudable. I also acknowledge the work of her predecessor, John Moloney. It is interesting from a political perspective and that of politicians making decisions that both the Minister of State and her predecessor came to this portfolio without any particular training or expertise or letters after their names but both of them brought the experience of life, of public representation and of what they saw in their families and communities. I hope the Minister of State will continue in this vein of individual thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is interesting we are having this debate in the Seanad because we are beginning to debate and reflect on the use of, and necessity for, this House in Irish public life.  One of the strengths of this House of the Oireachtas not only for decades but for generations is that it has provided a particular type of neutral debating space whereby people of all views can present their arguments and engage in political dialogue without the us against them or yes or no sort of politics which is sometimes evident in the other House.  If the Seanad is to have a future, which I believe it has, one of its roles will have to be advocacy — advocating on behalf of marginalised, excluded and forgotten groups.  The motion asks us to advocate on behalf of the disabled.  It is a very broad subject and the Minister of State was right to say we must be careful about the language used.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Minister of State has been given a clear message from all sides of the House that both Houses must see this issue not as one on which there should be a divide between Government and Opposition but as one on which we must all work together for people who, without our support, would be consigned to the margins of society.  It is no less important than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">It is difficult to argue with the motion.  The language is modest, moderate and realistic and it recognises the fact that, because of the economic constraints on our society, essential cutbacks are required.  I have never seen a motion before the Seanad or the Dáil tabled by the Opposition or by an Independent group which did the Government's bidding by recognising that we live in difficult economic times and that difficult and essential cutbacks may be necessary.  I thank the Independent Senators for being so mature in recognising the political and economic space which we are in.  I hope we can respond with an equally mature response and by saying there is no difference in our views.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">We need to send a strong signal from this House that services provision and advocacy for the disabled are very much at the top of our political agenda.  While we do not know our future, we know there are tens of thousands of people who, with a little bit of help and new thinking, can have a real future, can play a role in their families and communities and can live independently, where possible.  We are in a new space in regard to services for the disabled in terms of thinking and planning for a future which may not have been contemplated ten or 15 years ago.  There have been huge advances from a medical perspective.  We must match those medical and social advances with political advances.  What the Minister of State said is, hopefully, the beginning of ground-breaking thinking and politics from her, her Department and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The facts speak for themselves.  I refer to the acknowledgement of the €1.5 billion being spent on disability services.  The fact the vast majority of that is non-discretionary, as far as the people on whom it is being spent are concerned, must be noted with concern.  I was interested in what the Minister of State said about the mental capacity legislation.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is about to consider it.  She raised the interesting issue of language and it is something on which we will reflect at that committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The final part of the motion is one on which we need to reflect.  It asks the Government, under the departmental leadership of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to develop effective and appropriate legislative and policy responses across all Departments.  That is central.  While the Minister of State will play a lead role, her thinking and approach must not begin and end in her Department.  It must invade thinking and policy across Departments.  This is central to the progress we wish to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The words of the Minister of State are quite clear and we are at one on this matter.  The matter is political but not party political.  It requires political leadership, which the Minister of State is willing to provide, but it is not an issue on which there should be a party political divide.  The motion is worthy of the most serious consideration by the Oireachtas and Senators are honoured by the opportunity to listen to contributions by the Independent Senators and the Minister of State.  We should ensure that in word and in deed, this is acted upon.</p>

          <p eId="para_595">I welcome the motion and the Minister of State.  This is an important debate.  I look forward to continuing the debate in the coming years.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was not ratified by the previous Government and is not being ratified by the Government.  I received replies from the Minister for Justice and Equality recently.  The Government takes the approach that it will only ratify the convention it has signed up for after it has passed the necessary legislation.  That is work that will never end because there is so much to be done in getting the rights of people with disabilities onto the Statute Book.  It might be decades before we end up passing legislation to enshrine the rights people should have in law.  Perhaps the Minister of State can bring this point back to her colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">If a member of the deaf community with Irish sign language wants to interact with Members of this House, there is no provision for a sign language interpreter.  Some 5,000 members of the deaf community use Irish sign language and 50,000 people can use Irish sign language.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for the use of Irish sign language North and South.  It is in place in the North but there is no provision of services in the South for people to interact with State agencies, the medical profession or Members of the Oireachtas.  They cannot call upon interpreters to enable them to communicate with teachers in school, a principal or a public representative.  We have a long way to go on the most basic matters.  One would think that a member of the deaf community would be able to communicate with a Member of this House, yet if we want to bring a member of the deaf community to speak to a Minister, it will cost €200 to provide an interpreter.  That will have to be provided from the Member's pocket.  I am not worried about the money but about the fact that it is such a laborious process.  That is a small example of how we are not connecting people with disabilities to Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I welcome this debate.  We have a long way to go and we will never get there because it is a journey without an end.  It is continuing to provide services to people with disabilities and those who cannot speak for themselves, literally in the cases of people who are unable to speak.  It is our job to speak on their behalf to ensure that in these tough times the Government can provide the required services for people to live with dignity.</p>

He is actually not watching me because he is visually impaired — he is blind.  He supports the motion.  He is a testament to how a visually disabled person can make someone who is parachuted in here as a politician and a Senator look fantastic.  He has worked tirelessly on this motion.  He is a genius but he should not take that too seriously.  The defect in my personality is that I love to see a critical path and things being done.  I welcome the Minister of State saying that the value for money report will be published.  I would love her to ring Laurence Crowley tomorrow and ask him what is the date.  John Moloney was in this position in 2008 but it is now 2012.  If we were in the private sector, we would be out of business.  We must have a date.  I was wrong about rushing legislation and Senator Moloney is correct on this point.</p>

There must be a sense of urgency for those parents.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
          <p eId="para_618">I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and broad support for the Bill.  The rationale behind it is very sound.  It can end the current financial burden on industry by providing the full translation of the European patent to ensure full protection of the patent across Europe.  There is a strong appreciation in this House that it is vital that Irish business no longer be hampered by a system that is inefficient and costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I wish to address two issues raised on Second Stage last week, one of which was raised by Senator Mooney.  Concern was expressed that Irish enterprises were losing under the current European patent system as a result of the expense of registering a patent throughout Europe.  I would characterise it more as a loss of opportunity for Irish firms to enter new markets in Europe when patent holders take a selective cost-effective approach to invalidating states for patent protection.  Implementation of the London Agreement will go a considerable way to reducing this barrier, offering Irish enterprises easier access to these markets as a result of being able to protect their intellectual property at a more reasonable cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I will address an issue raised on Second Stage by Senator Crown last week, namely, a patent cliff for pharmaceutical products.  This is an issue that is well recognised by the pharmaceutical sector based in Ireland and our enterprise agencies.  The strategy for dealing with this includes a greater emphasis on niche markets and markets in rapidly developing economies and a modest but growing generic medicine industry in Ireland.  It is encouraging that the most recent trade figures continue to show strong export growth in medical and pharmaceutical products and the best way to sustain this growth is to maintain the current policy of the IDA of targeting the attraction of research and development activities in the pharmaceutical sector in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Although the Bill introduces modest changes, I ask Senators to take a note of two important points.  First, as the London Agreement comes into force throughout Europe, Irish-based enterprises and research are saving increased amounts in translation costs.  By ratifying the London Agreement Ireland will become a more attractive location to validate European patents, resulting in greater innovation activity here and income increase for the Irish Patents Office.  Second, this is one element in the continuing process of reforming the patent and overall intellectual property regime in Ireland to ensure it remains fit for purpose and enhance our attractiveness as an international IP hub.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The Bill will not come into effect until the corresponding patent rules are amended.  They give the detailed administrative guidance on the application of the Patents Act 1992.  Amendments to these rules will be brought in to effect by means of a statutory instrument signed by the Minister.  With regard to the EU patent, to date, 25 of the 27 member states of the EU have indicated a willingness to partake in such a system.  The Commission envisages that the first unitary patent protection will be issued in 2014.  I hope that adequately addresses the question.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I am grateful to the Senators for their comments and contributions on this issue, and also for their insights.  Some very incisive comments were made on Second Stage, to which we must have regard as we proceed with the legislation.  I express my appreciation to the House in that regard.</p>

            <from>Senator Imelda Henry</from>
            <p eId="para_626">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for coming to the House to deal with the motion.  It is almost two years since the publication of the independent Trinity College, Dublin report, There's No Place Like Home, a cost outcomes analysis of alternative models of care for young children with severe disabilities in Ireland.  It recommended that the HSE fill the estimated gap of almost €2 million to enable the expansion of Jack and Jill Children's Foundation care provision for children aged six, the age at which children begin to receive care through expanded Government programmes, rather than cutting off this service to children when they reach the age of four years.  Apparently, there are cases where children have finished with Jack and Jill Children's Foundation services but where the HSE is neither willing nor able to provide the vital home care plan required for these children and their families.  One case has gone all the way to the Ombudsman for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">It is hard to believe that the State has no national budget for pediatric home nursing care.  This is shocking in this day and age when we all know it makes sense to care for children with life-limiting conditions at home, thereby saving millions of euro for the taxpayer by keeping the children out of hospital where they might unnecessarily block beds.  Now is the time to reconsider the recommendations from the Trinity College report and to further analyse why it makes sense for the Jack and Jill programme to extend its age criteria.  When one sits down and calculates the return from investing in the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation by extending its age criteria to children aged up to six years, and the resulting money and hassle that would be saved to the State, the answer must be a resounding yes.  The main beneficiaries of such a move would be, of course, the children.  The State must stop looking at the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation as an annoying little children's charity looking for a handout.  It provides a vital service in the home within every community in Ireland.  It gets a five-star rating from parents and saves the State millions of euro every year by keeping babies out of hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The Trinity College report showed the cost effectiveness and quality of the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation service.  The foundation is ready, willing and able to provide what parents want and has the reach, flexibility and know-how to design care plans for children up to the age of six.  This is something the HSE has not shown itself capable of doing in a consistent and acceptable manner across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">I appeal to the Minister of State to meet the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, which has proven expertise in this field.  It is a voluntary body that saves the State millions of euro.  It would cost the State €40.5 million per annum if the 275 children currently under the wing of the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation landed back in hospital beds.  That is based on the Trinity College report figure of €147,000 per annum for hospital care.  The foundation provides a service — a lifeline — for families with the most desperately ill children.  In an age in where we are more than conscious of fiscal constraints, we must give this the most serious consideration and do what is best for the children and families involved.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_154">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_630">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. She stated the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation must not be seen as an "annoying little children's charity".  Anybody who has met its staff or encountered the type of work they do would never think that.  They are a highly professional specialised group of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">It gives me great pleasure to outline the position.  We have gone beyond the argument as to whether the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation is providing a worthwhile service. The report referred to by the Senator was commissioned by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation.  It recommended, among other things, that the State provide additional funding for the foundation to expand its services.  As is the case with all charities, the HSE is not in a position to provide additional funding for the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation to enable the expansion of its services.  However, the HSE is working with the foundation to identify and prioritise the needs of each child on a case by case basis to ensure that no child is hospitalised for want of adequate home support, provided by either the foundation or the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">The report asserts that the service provided by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation is significantly cheaper than hospital-based care. There is no dispute about the cost of hospital versus home-based services.  Where a child needs hospitalisation, it will be provided.  However, it is important to point out there is no provision of, or intention to provide, ongoing continuing care for children in an acute setting.  In other words, they should be at home wherever they can be.  The costs related to a 24 hour acute medical service will always show an unfavourable cost comparator to a home support service which is an entirely different service provided for families for a specified number of hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">HSE disability services reviewed the report, There's No Place Like Home, as part of its ongoing engagement with the foundation.  Subsequently, a review was undertaken pertaining to children aged over four years.  This process was to ensure that all children with life-limiting conditions would receive services on an equitable basis and through a standardised approach.  The review resulted in approximately 100 children being provided with alternative care.  Some care plans have reduced hours as the child is now attending education, or availing of other respite options.  In some cases, no further hours were required following discharge by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, as the supports provided by the HSE or other providers involved in the case were sufficient to meet the child's and family's needs.  For the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation, the priority remains the birth to four year age group, with HSE community services and other non-statutory agencies meeting some level of assessed need thereafter.  In some specific cases the foundation will continue to provide services for children aged over four years, as agreed with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">The Health Service Executive's national service plan for 2012, which has been drawn up against the backdrop of significant funding challenges, is designed to reflect the changed priorities of the new Government and the significant programme of reform to be undertaken.  The allocation for disability services will reduce in 2012 by 3.7% as a consequence of the impact of efficiency, procurement and targeted pay reduction savings.  However, the aim of the HSE will be to tailor such reductions in a way which minimises as much as possible the impact on service users and their families.  The Jack and Jill Children's Foundation service is part of a range of services provided for families funded by the HSE and other service providers for children with life-limiting conditions, of whom there are approximately 1,300.  Many of the children availing of services provided by the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation also avail of other specialist hospital and community health supports and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">The Health Service Executive is committed to working with the Jack and Jill Children's Foundation to ensure that all children with life-limiting conditions receive services on an equitable basis and through a standardised approach, and that they be progressed through the children's palliative care steering group.  The national policy, Palliative Care for Children with Life-Limiting conditions in Ireland, will ensure a national approach to the provision of services for children with life-limiting conditions.  All services and service providers will be governed by this approach.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I welcome the Minister to the House and I am delighted he could attend in person for the discussion on the report he commissioned.  I thank him for convening that group and publishing its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The commissioned report is a detailed piece of work, the result of intensive lobbying by concerned communities throughout the State, especially in the Cavan-Monaghan-Meath region, in respect of the North-South interconnector.  It is a by-product of an election promise by the Government to review and report on a case for, and cost of, placing underground all or part of the Meath-Tyrone 400 kV powerlines.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">At often great personal cost, financial and otherwise, community representatives have challenged and matched the unlimited resources of the State's apparatus in their journey to get these cables underground.  The lack of a definitive recommendation as to whether the electricity cables should go above or below ground leaves wide open the avenue for the Minister to instruct EirGrid to place the cables underground.  Unlike EirGrid, which has vehemently opposed the placing underground of the interconnector, the key finding must be that the expert commission found that such an option is a realistic solution.  It was not that it was impossible, nor that it would cost 20 times the cost of having them overground, as had been stated previously by EirGrid in debates prior to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">EirGrid must now accept that placing underground these cables is a viable solution.  It is primarily driven by significant technical developments and a commercial breakthrough of the most recently developed VSC-HVDC technology.  The report is of significant value to the argument surrounding the use and feasibility of such technology.  The report's findings and EirGrid's stubbornness in failing to admit that it could place the cables underground have been described as being similar to someone still using analogue television when the rest of the world is moving on to digital services.  This endorses what Sinn Féin and the campaigning communities have consistently stated and it flies in the face of EirGrid's assertions.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">The commission notes that the project will be slightly more expensive but it does not take into account the additional costs associated with overhead power lines and pylons.  Issues of note that were not provided for in the terms of reference include environmental impact assessments, land and property devaluation, the impact on farming and agriculture and the potential effects of pylons on people's health.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Where to now?  The Minister stated that following a brief period of consultation he would revert to the Government with a memorandum on security of energy supply to which EirGrid and the planning process will have regard.  How long will the consultation process last and to whom will it be open?  What influence will the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture exert over this?  When can we expect the memorandum to be published?  Will it be enforced by the Minister or will it simply be an advisory note to which EirGrid and planners can choose to have regard?  If EirGrid had had its way, there would not have been a report, these massive pylons would have been erected by now and the people would still be fed the same story that placing cables underground is not possible or feasible.  Most important, will the Minister halt further activity on the interconnector until the consultation process on the report coupled with the analysis of the memorandum has been completed?</p>
            <p eId="para_643">This time last year, Fine Gael, the largest Government party, promised that it would direct EirGrid to halt further activity on the interconnector until the analysis had been conducted but that has not happened.  The party also said it would instruct EirGrid to reimburse community groups for all relevant costs associated with participation in the oral hearing process in 2010 and that has not happened either.  Given EirGrid has completed the first round of non-statutory public consultation in preparation for submitting a formal new application to An Bord Pleanála, people do not just have the right to inform the process but, as the option has been deemed feasible, they have the right to have their costs reimbursed.  I would like the Minister, separately, to instruct EirGrid to do that.  The company should not be allowed to plough ahead with its plans until this report has been seriously analysed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_644">I would like to stress the strategic imperative for the economy and citizens of cost effective investment in electricity networks.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the investment plans of EirGrid and ESB Networks are delivered across the country.  The significant level of grid investment required in the next decade is critical for safe and secure electricity supply.  It will underpin regional economic growth and job creation and it will enable delivery of the Government's renewable energy ambitions in line with Ireland's EU targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">The security of energy supply is fundamental to the well-being of all society and the economy.  Ireland is a peripheral island energy market which is vulnerable to the effects of international disruptions to oil and gas supplies.  I confirm that I will bring a  memorandum on security of energy supplies to the Government in the coming weeks and the consultation period I envisaged at the time I published the report was approximately six weeks.  I cannot control the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture and, therefore, I do not know how long it will take to assess the issue.  The committee will influence the outcome.  I will stop all development until the consultation period is over.  Having said that, there is a necessity to get on with this project as quickly as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The memorandum to which the Senator referred will address the imperative of cost effective investment in the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks and the need to build other critical energy infrastructure in the national interest.  The North-South interconnector is vital infrastructure for the island, something that is not questioned by any reasonable citizen.  The lack of sufficient interconnection between the North and South is preventing the full benefits of the all-island market being realised.  The continued absence of the interconnector is costing the economies, North and South, up to €30 million every year.  It is vital for security of electricity supply on this island.  It is critically needed to connect renewable energy to the system and to deliver economic development in the north-east region.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The North-South project has been under development since 2005 and is recognised by the EU as a strategically vital project.  In common with all such transmission line projects around Europe, the plans for the North-South line have been marked by controversy.  The programme for Government committed to the appointment of an international commission to review and report on the case for, and cost of, placing underground the Meath-Tyrone power lines.  I appointed the international expert commission last July.  The members, from Sweden, Norway and Belgium, have long-standing professional and academic credentials and experience in transmission and power systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">Meetings were held by the commission members with EirGrid, the CER, ESB Networks, County Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee, the Irish Farmers' Association, and the North-East Pylon Pressure Group and, at my request, they also met Oireachtas representatives from counties Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.  The commission also toured much of the proposed route.  I received the commission's report on 9 January and, having advised Government colleagues, published the report on my Department's website on 17 January.  I also forwarded the report to the Chairman of the Oireachtas committee.  Publication of the report allows for a period of reflection for some weeks.  I encourage Senators to read the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">In the time available, I do not propose to go into the detail of its analysis but the report is succinct, thorough and easily accessible.  I welcome it as a further independent input into the debate on transmission lines.  The commission recognises the importance of the Meath-Tyrone transmission line for consumers and security of supply, North and South.  The commission notes that there is no single "right" solution.  Technical solutions must be project specific.  The report does not, therefore, recommend any particular technical option, while recommending against wholly going underground using AC cable.  It provides its own views on the feasible technology options available for consideration for the Meath-Tyrone project, including HVDC technology, given the changes in technology, suppliers and costs in recent years.  In that context, the commission estimates that the cost of implementing the project as an HVDC underground cable option would be three times the cost of the traditional overhead line option, while noting that costs estimates are always uncertain.  I commend the report to the Seanad.  I welcome its scrutiny and a thoroughgoing debate by the Oireachtas joint committee in the near future.</p>

            <from>Senator Martin Conway</from>
            <p eId="para_650">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking this matter.  I was surprised when I was contacted by representatives of surfing groups recently to point out that the 23% VAT rate applied to surfing lessons.  Despite my limited knowledge of surfing, I was surprised to learn that.  They made the case that given surfing lessons are primarily taken by local children and tourists, the 9% VAT rate would be more appropriate and I am inclined to agree with them.  The Government has made significant progress with the tourism jobs initiative that was introduced last July and it had an instant effect in breathing confidence into the tourism sector.  Like the Cathaoirleach, I represent a coastal county and surfing has evolved, particularly in the past decade.  We now have a situation in many of our towns, from Donegal to Cork and Waterford, whereby visitors come to surf not only during summer months but also in the depths of winter.  Surfing is an activity that provides significant additional value to the economy and it continues to offer considerable potential for growth.  The number of young people who express interest in learning how to surf is increasing.  Unfortunately, however, the cost of the activity is becoming prohibitive.  If the Government introduced a provision in the Finance Bill to reduce the VAT rate on surf lessons from 23% to 9%, another small step could be taken towards offering an overall tourism product.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">As our unique climate means we cannot be weather dependent, we must develop a product that attracts families to the coast in all weather conditions.  There has been significant investment in indoor facilities.  In my constituency alone, over €100 million has been invested in indoor facilities for several years.  We have also seen what I describe as healthy investment in nature walks.  My own area of the Burren has secured investments in the order of €100,000 to upgrade walks to attract hikers.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">My proposal would send a clear message that the Government is prepared to invest in surfing.  The facilities provided to surfers are modest.  Most beaches do not even have shower facilities and anybody who is familiar with surfing will be aware of the importance of washing wetsuits after they are used.  I do not propose that the VAT reduction should extend to surf equipment, whether surf boards or wetsuits.  One surf operator in my area who previously employed three full-time and five or six part-time instructors has had to reduce his staffing to three or four part-time instructors alongside his own role as a full-time instructor.  In light of the potential direct benefits in terms of employment, I hope the Minister will have good news from the Department of Finance.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_159" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_653">I am pleased to have this opportunity to respond to the important matter raised by the Senator on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services.  The rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The EU VAT directive governs VAT law and the rates applicable to various goods and services.  The directive provides that member states must apply a standard rate of VAT to the majority of goods and services and this rate must be between 15% and 25%.  Ireland's standard rate is currently 23%.  Member states may also apply up to two reduced rates of VAT of between 5% and 15% on set goods and services listed in annex III of the VAT directive.  Ireland, along with the majority of member states, operates two reduced VAT rates of 9% and 13.5%.  The VAT directive also allows member states to apply a zero rate, reduced rate or a rate of less than 5% to goods and services where such a rate applied to those goods or services on 1 January 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The supply of surfing lessons is subject to VAT at the standard rate of 23%.  As annex III of the directive does not include surfing lessons it is not possible to apply a reduced VAT rate to surfing lessons.  Furthermore, as surfing lessons did not qualify for reduced, super reduced or zero rate of VAT on 1 January 1991 it is not possible to apply any of those VAT rates to surfing lessons.  Consequently, surfing lessons must be charged at the standard VAT rate of 23%.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">For Ireland to apply the 9% reduced VAT rate to the supply of surfing lessons we would require an amendment in the VAT directive to include the supply of surfing lessons in annex III.  Changes to the VAT directive are made periodically by the European Council of Finance Ministers following detailed analysis and negotiation at the Council working party on tax questions.  A number of goods and services were added to annex III in 2009, primarily related to labour-intensive services, following six years of negotiations on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">While many tourism related services were made subject to the lower reduced VAT rate of 9% from 1 July 2011, this rate only applies to those tourist related goods and services that are listed under annex III of the VAT directive.  Some tourism related activities not listed under annex III continue to be subject to VAT at 13.5% and 23%, while others are exempt from VAT.  The 9% VAT rate introduced on 1 July 2011 applies to restaurant and catering services and hotel and holiday accommodation, including guesthouses, caravan parks and camping sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Other activities related to tourism that are subject to the 9% rate include various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions and fairgrounds or amusement parks.  The use of sports facilities, including green fees charged for golf and subscriptions charged by non-member owned golf clubs, also apply at the new lower VAT rate.  Admissions to historical houses and gardens, including open or pet farms, also apply at the 9% rate.  Hairdressing services, a growing activity connected to hotel services, also apply at the 9% rate, as does printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues and newspapers.  Books are already subject to VAT at the zero rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">Tourism related activities charged at the 13.5% rate include tour guide services and the short-term hiring of cars, boats, caravans, mobile homes, tents or trailer tents.  Passenger transport, including the transport of tourists, is exempt from VAT.  All other goods and services related to the tourism industry, including surfing lessons, apply at the standard VAT rate of 23%.  In addition, while restaurant and catering services apply at the 9% rate, alcohol or soft drinks sold as part of a meal, or otherwise, are liable to VAT at the 23% rate.  However, an exemption from VAT may still apply to surfing lessons in certain circumstances. Surfing lesson providers, like any other service businesses, may opt not to register for VAT if their turnover is under the VAT registration threshold of €37,500 per annum. Where this is the case VAT will not apply to the lessons.</p>

            <from>Senator Martin Conway</from>
            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Minister for a comprehensive and informative reply.  In regard to his comment that rates "must be between 15% and 25%" can a case be made for creating a VAT rate of 15% for certain activities?  There are health benefits to getting people out on the water to exercise.  Perhaps he might investigate with the Minister for Finance whether there is scope for creating a rate of 15%.  During the next round of negotiations, which will probably be even more difficult than the previous round, the Government may consider exempting surf lessons from VAT.</p>

            <p eId="para_661">I will be glad to raise the Senator's questions with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  The usual argument applies.  A good case can be made to extend the 9% VAT rate.  That is not possible in these circumstances for the reasons I explained, that is, it is not included in annex III of the VAT directive.  The specific point made by the Senator about the 15% to 23% range is something about which I would be glad to talk to the Minister for Finance.  There are any number of good arguments that can be made to reduce the VAT rate and I imagine the Minister will be looking at it from the point of view of the impact on the Exchequer.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">We could dispense with the debate, but it will be held in public nonetheless.  It was an entirely different topic we were talking about.  My question was about the need for the Minister with responsibility for local government to clarify, with regard to the interim report of the local government and local development alignment steering group, whether he seeks closer amalgamation or co-operation of local development companies with local authorities or integration of the development companies into local authorities.  This is an important question because there is a large amount of funding available to Leader groups.  It is important that the local development companies have autonomy and independence in respect of local authorities, and that local authorities do not have undue influence or control over the Leader groups, especially in light of the finding of the European Court of Auditors in 2010 regarding the Leader approach to rural development, which found: "The potential added value of a partnership approach was not achieved in [local action groups] where the decision-making was dominated by the local authorities".  It also states: "One of the key features of the Leader approach is that decisions should be made not by public authorities but by a wider local partnership, where the local government is included but does not have a majority vote".  The clear point is that the European Court of Auditors has said we are doing it the right way and that local groups should have the final say.  The input from local authorities is very important but if they have the majority this funding will be directed more towards local authority concerns and initiatives than those of the local partnerships and organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">There are 52 local development companies throughout the country, which include members of local authorities, but they do not have a majority.  I ask the Minister of State to let us know her views on this.  Closer co-operation is important, and there is close co-operation, but if the local authorities get their hands on the funding — which this year, I believe, is something like €92 million, having risen by nearly €40 million — the local communities that normally decide where the funding goes will lose that power.  The money would be seen to be going to public representatives, but the staff and the county manager would actually have an enormous input if the local authorities were to take over the running of the Leader groups.  We have seen already that the local authorities have an input in the county development boards.  The Leader groups do a great job and should be allowed to continue to do it in a manner that has been pointed to by the European Union as one that works.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_169">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_670">I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss this issue and expressing his concerns about the alignment of local communities and local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">The programme for Government has committed to a review of local governance structures with a view to improving delivery of services to the citizen.  As part of giving effect to this commitment, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, established a high-level steering group last September to discuss enhancing the alignment between local government and the local development sector.  The Minister set out on a course of alignment rather than integration — I assure the Senator in that regard — and I know he is still thinking in those terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">The steering group was given a broad remit to review the roles of local development and local government, to identify the scope for greater synergies between the sectors, and to provide recommendations on how we might deliver simplified, cost-effective and efficient services for the citizen in a way that allows for local oversight and democratic accountability.  The group has consulted extensively with stakeholders in order to receive input from all those involved in the area of local and community development, and I understand this input has proved valuable to the group in its work towards developing recommendations for greater alignment of the sectors.  The steering group presented an interim report to the Minister in early December, outlining some preliminary conclusions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the existing arrangements and the respective roles of local authorities and the local and community development sector in the provision of local and community development services.  The group reaffirmed the need for a more coherent approach to local service provision.  It sees the need for a more central role for local government in planning, decision-making and oversight of local development programmes.  The group also acknowledged the importance of retaining the developmental bottom-up approach to local development, with its focus on targeting those most in need and facilitating meaningful community participation.  It recommended that this valuable approach be embedded as an integral part of the planning and decision-making process for the delivery of services at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">In the past two decades, certain gaps in service provision at local level have been filled successfully by local development companies.  They now have a proven track record when it comes to supporting local communities.  The Minister is aware that the local development companies have unique strengths, skills and experiences, and he will expect them to continue to play a pivotal role in the implementation of local development actions.  The Minister has an equally strong belief in the central role that local government has in the lives of our communities.  Local government should exercise local leadership.  As part of that, local authorities give coherent and strategic direction to the delivery of community and local development interventions at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">A key focus, therefore, of this alignment process is to harness the strengths and experiences of the local government and local development sectors.  This is a great opportunity to bring greater coherence to the provision of services and maximise the benefits for communities, especially when resources are scarce and services are very much needed.  The Minister is confident that local government and local development can work in partnership to deliver efficient, sustainable, joined-up and easy to access services for people locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">The Senator raised the issue of the European Court of Auditors report on the implementation of the Leader approach.  I recognise that it contained a number of recommendations to ensure the values of the Leader approach are retained.  There is a strong record in Ireland with regard to the Leader programme and we will not introduce measures that will damage our standing in this regard.  I am confident that any recommendations the steering group proposes will fully respect the findings in the European Court of Auditors' report and will not breach the Leader requirements with regard to the composition and decision-making process of local action groups as defined in the EU regulations.  I understand the steering group will present its final report to the Minister in the coming weeks.  Its recommendations will inform our plans with regard to the overall local government reform agenda and will be subject to careful consideration in that context.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p>
