          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Seán Canney)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T09:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, and flood relief , I am pleased to be here today to consider the 2016 Estimate and undertake a mid-year review of outputs and expenditure relating to the OPW Vote for the current financial year. I will also summarise the OPW’s emerging position on the 2017 Estimate requirements in advance of the allocations being finalised for budget 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> In order to assist the committee, members have been provided with an explanatory note setting out a short description of the spend areas in the OPW Vote, expenditure incurred to date on subheads in 2016, output information relating to each spending area and the emerging Estimate requirements for 2017. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Expenditure to the end of May 2016 is €128.984 million out of a total allocation of €391.526 million this year. This represents 34% of the gross current allocation and 30% of the capital allocation to date which is an expenditure trend consistent with previous years. While there is some variance from profiled spend on a subhead basis, the two main programmes of expenditure are projected to be on target by year end. Some reallocation of funds on the estate portfolio management side may be necessary to facilitate strategic property acquisitions in 2016. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> In terms of 2017 requirements, my officials have confirmed to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the Vote 13 allocation is deemed sufficient to fulfil the existing level of service commitments on a no-policy-change basis. This confirmation is subject to allocation adjustments on a subhead basis being made within the overall OPW Vote allocation. In particular, an increase on the current allocation will be required to ensure the resources are in place for the delivery of the flood risk management programme within the ten year timeframe committed to by the Government. I am particularly determined that the delivery of this programme is prioritised in the coming years. Additional projects or services from within the programme for partnership Government or on foot of other policy initiatives will be separately resourced. Some of these proposals are under discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the Estimates process. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The OPW Vote has two main expenditure areas which may be impacted by policy changes, the first of which is flood risk management. The Government has demonstrated its support for flood relief by committing €430 million to flood risk management within the 2016 to 2021 capital investment plan. I am satisfied that this represents sufficient funding to progress flood protection works and the OPW is currently undertaking the required staff recruitment programme to ensure the capacity is in place to facilitate its delivery. I do not need to revisit the difficulties caused by flooding which have recently been experienced by communities across the country, including in Roscommon in the last week. However, I can assure the committee that the key actions and activities necessary to protect communities from flood risk in the years ahead are being addressed not just in the OPW, but across all State bodies with a role to play in flood protection. </p>
          <p eId="para_16"> In terms of output to date in 2016, progress on flood risk management continues to be a challenge for the OPW. Long lead-in times to bring these complex engineering infrastructure projects to commencement stage are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Unforeseen technical design issues, archeological and environmental difficulties, public consultation and procurement challenges are elements which can impact on the delivery timeframe. Despite this, I have asked my officials to explore every avenue possible to advance schemes as quickly as possible and I am confident the target outputs and expenditure projections for 2016 are set to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In terms of output measurement, the key purpose of this programme is to ensure that the risks associated with flooding and the impacts identified in climate change are considered and appropriate plans to investigate flood risk are put in place. The overall outcome is to reduce the risk of river and coastal flooding to homes and businesses and to ensure appropriate flood risk information for planning in Ireland. The setting of demonstrative performance targets in this area is difficult but is currently being summarised under two outcome measures: the annual and cumulative number of additional properties benefiting from flood relief works; and the annual and cumulative value of benefit to properties - damage or loss avoided in economic terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> It can be reported that schemes are continuing at Claregalway, Bray and on the River Dodder and this year will see the completion of the schemes at Ennis lower, Waterford and south Campshires in Dublin. Contracts have recently been agreed for works to commence at Bandon and Skibbereen and I am pleased that works will commence this year at Templemore in Tipperary, Foynes in Limerick and Dunkellin in County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> In terms of progress not covered by tangible output measures, there has also been recent progress on other fronts. The interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group has a significant role to play in a whole-of-government approach to addressing flood risk. One of my first and early tasks was to convene a further meeting of the interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, which was held on 2 June 2016 to get an update on the progress being made towards a report for Government on a range of flood risk management initiatives. This group is looking at a range of policy issues, including insurance, community resilience, individual property protection, a national flood forecasting and warning service, a review of the planning and development guidelines and if necessary, voluntary home relocation. I will be finalising the report of the group for Government shortly, in conjunction with the completion of the draft flood risk management plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Government has also established the Shannon flood risk State agency co-ordination working group to enhance co-operation across the State agencies with a statutory remit on the River Shannon. This group is comprised of the State agencies involved with the River Shannon and comes under the chairmanship of the Office of Public Works. The group has met on three occasions to date and has conducted an audit of the roles and responsibilities of State agency organisations and has published its Shannon flood risk work programme for 2016. This programme, which is available on the OPW website, sets out co-ordinated actions and activities for the Shannon catchment. The group has agreed a process for wider consultation, including with non-statutory bodies, and has held a series of open days on the group's work programme. The group is also considering the development of appropriate guidance in consultation with the Attorney General's office that will set out more clearly the rights and responsibilities of non-statutory bodies in relation to watercourses. The working group will hold its next meeting in July to consider the Shannon catchment flood risk assessment management, CFRAM, plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The CFRAM programme has produced a comprehensive suite of flood maps for each area for further assessment, AFA, which identifies the risk in those areas for flooding events of varying severity, ranging from frequent events, such as those we might see every couple of years, up to extreme events that might not be seen for generations. The programme is now looking at all possible options to address flood risk in each AFA and, where possible, has identified viable structural and non-structural flood risk management measures to manage or reduce the flood risk within the AFAs and within each river catchment as a whole. The identified measures will form the basis of a series of flood risk management plans which set out the medium to long-term strategy and programme of work to achieve the effective and sustainable management of flood risk in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The flood maps will contribute directly to the better management of flood risk. These maps have been produced for 300 communities around the country covering 90 coastal areas and nearly 7,000 km of river. Over the coming months the CFRAM programme will publish the draft flood risk management plans with a formal consultation period of not less than three months; complete a further round of public consultation days within the relevant communities to consult locally on the proposals; and prioritise the preferred measures, informed through a multi-criteria analysis, in order to finalise the plans at the end of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The final plans will then be submitted for approval to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and may then be adopted by the local authorities. It has to be recognised and understood that there will not be a feasible flood risk solution for all properties and the policy response for these properties has to form part of the integrated flood risk policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I am confident that the Government's strategy of implementing this suite of measures to manage flood risk will better prepare Ireland to manage the threat of flooding in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The other main programme for my office is estate portfolio management which encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State's property portfolio. This includes the conservation, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties in State care.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Office of Public Works has rationalised the State's office accommodation portfolio to reflect the changing numbers in the Civil Service since 2008, surrendering over 300 leases with cumulative savings of over €130 million in that period. With rents now rising, particularly in Dublin, and the demands for accommodation increasing, there are mounting challenges in the rationalisation of properties.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> A more strategic approach to the management of State property is being led by my office requiring all State property holders to view public property from a State perspective. The actions identified in the property asset management delivery plan are being achieved through improved co-ordination of property asset management across the public service; increasing the capacity to benchmark building performance through standardised building measurement; and optimising the use of the State's property assets through asset sharing and asset transfer using streamlined protocols.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> The OPW continues to meet space requirements through office rationalisation and greater use of open plan, but additional space demands can only be delivered through a combination of the following: new leases of modern offices, investment in older State-owned properties, or the purchase or construction of alternative accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> In order to ensure that the office is well positioned to effectively oversee this ongoing reform area, my officials are currently engaged in a business transformation process on the estate portfolio management function which may impact on 2017 Estimate requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> In terms of annual funding, A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out objectives that may generate increased demand for Civil Service office accommodation. There are a number of major developments in planning within this office which will not form part of the existing level of service and these will need to be considered for future years' funding. In addition, the office has commenced planning a substantive body of works over the next five years under a property retrofit programme to allow for the refit of the existing stock of Government accommodation. This will maintain building fabric and optimise the capacity of office buildings within State-owned accommodation. This is necessary to increase utilisation of existing property, in addition to addressing the EU requirements to minimise carbon emissions and carbon footprint by 2018 of public buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> It is worth noting that the Office of Public Works has a key role to play in the delivery of services which are not directly funded by the OPW Vote, yet consume resources in their delivery. For example, the OPW manages a comprehensive Garda building programme and in 2015, the Government launched a capital investment plan for An Garda Síochána for 2016-21 which involves the major refurbishment of stations facilities from both the OPW and the Garda Vote. Three new divisional-regional Garda headquarters, at Kevin Street, Dublin, Wexford and Galway, are currently on site and will be delivered during 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> In the heritage area, the Office of Public Works continues to engage with Fáilte Ireland in realising the tourism potential of many of the historic visitor sites which it manages across the entire country.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Guided visitor services are provided at 70 sites nationwide on either a seasonal or a full-time basis. These sites include both nationally and internationally known attractions such as Newgrange, Clonmacnoise, Glendalough, Kilmainham Gaol, etc. They are a key part of Ireland's offering to visitors and meet the needs of particular segments of the international tourist body, such as the free and independent traveller and the culturally curious, which have been identified by Fáilte Ireland as key targets. The agencies are co-operating on the better marketing and presentation of these locations with a view to increasing visitor footfall and introducing certain lesser-known sites to the visiting public.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> My office and Fáilte Ireland are also co-operating in respect of new tourism potential built on the success of the Wild Atlantic Way, which encompasses a broad range of the OPW's historic sites. In the context of Ireland's Ancient East, the OPW, the former Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Fáilte Ireland have entered into a strategic partnership, aiming to invest in a series of capital works developments over the period 2016 to 2021 which are designed to improve the offering to visitors at a broad range of locations within the historic portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The OPW heritage service is also responsible for providing a quality event management service and logistical support to other Departments and Government generally. In performing these duties it has been proactively managing and facilitating State events in this decade of commemorations, including this year, the successful 1916 commemorative events. I realise that I have referred to only a small part of the work of the OPW, which has a vast array of responsibilities but if members have any questions on any area of the office's funding or outputs, I will be happy to take them.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I thank the Minister of State. The agenda states that the committee is to consider the 26 Revised Estimates. I wish to make all those present aware of the following: no decisions are taken by the committee in relation to its consideration of the Estimates; the committee is only empowered to consider the Estimates and cannot alter, amend or vote on them; the committee must send a message to the Dáil when it has completed its consideration of the Estimates and it cannot decide not to do so; under Standing Order 90, that message must be to the effect that the select committee has completed its consideration of an Estimate referred to it by the Dáil; there is no provision for the expression of opinion by the committee on the Estimates in its message; and, as the standing order prescribes the nature of the message to be sent, the content is not a matter for decision by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I consider that puts us in the position of being glove puppets for the whole process in this House. The standing order reduces this debate to a farce because we cannot send any messages or do anything and I want to put on record my disappointment, which is nothing to do with the Minister of State, with this arrangement and the fact that the public sees the Dáil referring the Estimates to committee. It will hear the message going back from this committee, which is already set down and it believes we will forensically examine the Estimate and the public should know that is not the case. I am not prepared to entertain this type of arrangement on an ongoing basis. I will continue to make public statements as the Chairman or raise the matter in the Dáil to ensure that committees are appropriately empowered to do what is necessary. Let it be known, however, that it is a complete farce that the committees are appointed and their hands are tied.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> In respect of the joint committee, I understand that the Members from the Seanad have not yet been appointed and that there is some haggling going on about how they are to be appointed. That is holding up the work of this committee. That has to be stated and if we are allowed to send a message, perhaps one should be sent to the Seanad to please get its act together and give us the members of the committee so that we can continue our work.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We should be receiving our information in a timely fashion from the various Departments that come before us. That did not happen today. I know there has been a particular political process that delayed matters and the formation of committees. We are considering the Estimates for this year in June. Every Department would know exactly what we are going to debate here so the information should come to us long before the day prior to a meeting. I ask the Minister of State to bring this to the attention of those who provide the committee with information and to indicate that what happened in this instance will not be acceptable in the future. We want information to be supplied in a timely fashion in order to give members the opportunity to read into the brief and understand the figures concerned. That being the background to the meeting, I open it to members if they wish to raise questions on the Estimates.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and wish him well in his role. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to his first engagement with the select committee and wish him well in his role.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> What are the figures for the outturn for last year? Did the OPW spend all of its budget last year? Can the Minister of State explain why the budget for programme A, flood risk management, for 2016 is down by 16% in comparison with the 2015 allocation? The Minister of State spoke about the very large allocation by Government of €430 million to flood risk management for the period 2016 to 2021 but that does not seem to correlate with the actual figure for 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> In regard to ensuring that insurance cover is provided for areas where flood relief schemes have been completed, the previous Government had a series of meetings with the insurance industry in January and there were promises of further engagement and action if necessary. Where schemes have been completed by the OPW to the required standard under the European directive, is it the Minister of State's view that the insurance industry should ensure that cover is reinstated? There seems to be a dispute between the insurance industry and the OPW about the use of demountable defences. The industry does not seem to recognise these as being of equal value and as being as effective as permanent defences. Will the Minister of State comment on that and say how open-minded he is about the introduction of legislation, if necessary, to deal with the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Can the Minister of State give us an update on the Cork city flood relief scheme? It is almost seven years since Cork city was devastated by flooding in November 2009. The scheme has been delayed several times and we still await definitive confirmation of when the scheme will happen and I would appreciate an update on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">Responsibility for insurance and legislation for insurance rests with the Department of Finance. In the context of the interdepartmental group set up to consider policy, the Department of Finance will be bringing forward options in terms of what we can do to ensure that people are insured. In areas in which the OPW has put in place permanent defences that meet the requisite standards, the level of reinsurance stands at approximately 89%. As Deputy Michael McGrath highlighted, however, insurance companies are refusing to reinsure people in areas where temporary defences are put in place. We need to consider the different options. I expect to get recommendations or suggestions on how to deal with that from the interdepartmental committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_48"> In 2016, there was a 16% decrease in funding. A separate fund was provided for storm damage, through the Office of Public Works, to compensate local authorities for floods, so that is why the figure was like that. There was also a carry-forward of €7 million into this year's budget from last year's flood risk management budget. Was there anything else?</p>

          <p eId="para_63">Yes. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in his new role. I have a few policy-related questions. He said in his speech that he would fulfil the existing level of service and there would be no policy change. I want to flesh this out. Does he mean the <i>status quo</i> will obtain from 2015 to 2016 and there will be no new departures in terms of policy implementation, particularly for the management of heritage?</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I note that the Minister of State referred to heritage services. He mentioned very specific sites and talked about co-operating with Fáilte Ireland on initiatives such as Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. A pot of approximately €65 million has been made available for capital projects by Fáilte Ireland. How will that money be disbursed? Will it be disbursed outside the keynote sites that are normally referred to in terms of tourist attractions? He referred specifically to Kilmainham Gaol, Glendalough, Clonmacnoise and Killarney National Park. There are other sites that I would advocate, such as Doneraile Wildlife Park in Cork, which has approximately 450,000 visitors per annum. Will there be a change in policy that would allow such sites to be marketed along with either the Wild Atlantic Way or Ireland's Ancient East? I want to get a sense from him of how he views heritage sites, tourism potential and job creation in rural areas. There are sites that are a little off the beaten track but they are no less important than the big keynote sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> With regard to CFRAM, Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned the Cork project and insurance issues. The Munster Blackwater, and specifically the flood alleviation works that were carried out in Fermoy and Mallow, are keynote OPW projects that have delivered significant benefits. My next issue is demountable walls. Has an actuarial analysis been done to assess the cost of insurance in cases in which demountable walls have been put in place? There is clear evidence that the presence of demountable walls alleviates flooding. I do not mean to be too parochial but I am referring to the Munster Blackwater, where the OPW did a stellar job in two specific towns. There is proof that demountable walls work because they have stopped towns from being flooded. That should, from an actuarial point of view, have the knock-on effect of driving down insurance premiums. We need to be more vociferous and stronger when sending a message to the insurance companies about such issues. In my opinion, insurance companies are using the excuse that there is a lack of evidence to support demountable works or that there is some actuarial analysis or mitigating risk factor associated with demountable walls. Perhaps this is an issue that the Minister of State could take up. Can I have a specific start date for the Bandon and Skibbereen projects? </p>
          <p eId="para_66"> My next point also concerns CFRAM. It could be argued that the OPW maps trawl well beyond certain curtilages, especially in villages with arterial drains, minor rivers or streams. Even if one were to assess the 100-year flood risk in certain places, the analysis would drive up the cost of insurance for the people who live there. Has CFRAM looked at towns and villages that have tributaries? Has CFRAM adopted a belt-and-braces approach to alleviating flood risk in such places? The area for further assessment identifies the risk. How does CFRAM measure the risk? Does it use the usual formula of the 100-year flood? Is it less than that?</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I thank the Minister of State for his statement. Notwithstanding his statement that there will be no policy change, are there specific issues related to the timeframe in which to deliver projects? What does he wish to achieve, on his watch as Minister of State responsible for the OPW, in terms of heritage, the management of natural resources and flood alleviation? I would like him to outline, in his own words, his vision for the Department. Have functions been clearly delineated and delegated to him in terms of the management of his budget?</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_24" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_68">I shall first refer to heritage sites. Ireland has some of the finest sites in the world. The marketing of them is not what it should be and we seem to have kept them a secret, especially sites not located on the main thoroughfares. Tourists are dragged around the east and west coasts and down the south to visit attractions but they are unaware that there are fine sites in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The core policy of the OPW is the care, maintenance and preservation of the sites. The marketing of the sites is carried out in collaboration with Fáilte Ireland. I hope that in future there will be more collaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> A total of €5 million, for example, was invested in Kilmainham Jail in 2016. That will increase visitor numbers from 350,000 to 500,000. That is the type of growth we wish to achieve, and we want to replicate that in other places. The policy does not have to change; it is a matter of making use of existing resources and collaborating with other local authorities and with Fáilte Ireland in order to market sites and make them more vibrant and accessible. There is potential all over the country, including in the midlands where we could set up a wetlands area that would be a unique feature in this country. There are things we can do such as the example outlined. The OPW has an interpretative centre there that could work in collaboration with Longford and Roscommon county councils to create something completely different. It is important to work together. The policy does not change; that is still about the care and maintenance of sites and to ensure they are open, well kept and that we increase the visitor numbers. That is something on which we are working. Visitor numbers are growing. They are up 33% on last year. In my area of east Galway there are fine sites but we are not getting enough visitors. Overall, visitor numbers are up but we must spread them out a bit more.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Deputy Sherlock’s second question related to the Munster Blackwater area. He mentioned insurance and flood defences. What the Taoiseach said is on record, namely, that the temporary defences put up by the Office of Public Works are based on best international standards. The situation is that insurance companies refuse to ensure people but there are options open to the Minister for Finance, including saying companies must insure people, but then one would not have any control over the premium or policy excess. There is no point in saying to someone that he or she will get insurance for his or her home but it will cost €10,000 a year. We must be realistic. We can say to the insurance industry that we want it to insure people but the difficulty under law is that we cannot set the premium. The Department of Finance is looking at other options and they will be brought before the all-party committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> The CFRAM programme is based on areas where there are villages and towns. Flood issues in rural areas are addressed through minor works that can be carried out by local authorities with funding provided by the Office of Public Works. That work has been taking place in recent years and is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> Deputy Sherlock also asked a question about Bandon and Skibbereen. I was in Skibbereen two weeks ago. The contract has been signed there and the contractor is mobilising and will be on site within weeks, if he is not already setting up there. I expect the Deputy will see the work commence in July. The letter of acceptance has been sent to the contractor in the case of Bandon and the contract is about to be signed. There are a few issues in terms of the final pieces of paperwork to be submitted to the Office of Public Works, which is the contracting authority in that regard. Between July and August both of those projects will be up and running on site. I am delighted for Deputy Sherlock and the people of Cork that they are going ahead because that is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> A question was also asked by Deputy Sherlock about timeframes for carrying out projects. In the past four to five weeks in the Department I have examined the flood relief programmes, how the projects are being delivered and the time taken from the inception of a project to getting a contract signed or getting the work started on the ground. It appears that the process is taking an inordinate amount of time, on average, between six and seven years. That is not great comfort for people who have been flooded. We are looking at ways to streamline the process to reduce the timeframe between the project being accepted and the commencement of works. The areas we are looking at are procurement, planning, compliance issues, tendering and how we could reduce the timeframe. I am working on the issue with all the other Departments that are involved. We met yesterday and agreed that it is an issue we will examine because we need to do something about the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">Yes. My point about flood mapping is that if one takes CFRAM and a small village with a stream going through it where there has not been a flood within living memory, the insurance maps will show clearly at present that the curtilage of the stream is very wide and the area is deemed to be a flood plain. I might not have explained myself clearly. When the CFRAM study on the villages and towns we are talking about sees the light of day there must be a realistic mechanism built in such that one looks at the 100-year risk. If a village has not flooded, or the stream has not burst its banks, in living memory, and people are paying an extra premium for their insurance because the mapping is such that the curtilage is very wide either side of the bank, then I contend that the OPW or the Minister of State must look at the issue because it is driving up the cost of insurance and some places are uninsurable as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Barryscourt Castle in Cork is another prime OPW site. We all acknowledge the excellence with which the OPW carries out its work in terms of care, maintenance and enhancement, because it has spent considerable resources recently enhancing such sites off the beaten track. Barryscourt Castle in Carrigtwohill is on a main thoroughfare and it is an example of wonderful work conducted by the OPW but it has been closed for some time and it is still closed. If the Minister of State cannot respond to me on the issue today perhaps he could revert to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">To reply to Deputy Sherlock about the maps, I do not think he is talking about flood plains but where the maps have been drawn up suggesting areas are a potential flood risk although there has never been flooding. The insurance companies are looking at that. They are also looking at their own maps as well. There is an issue in that regard. The CFRAM process looks at a range of flood risks, including five-year, ten-year, 20-year, 50-year or 100-year flood cycles. There might be an issue with insurance companies using the maps to increase premiums or to refuse to insure people if they see any potential risk on a map.</p>

I have met with the interdepartmental group which includes the Department of Finance. I have met with other groups to try to get a handle on everything that is happening and to understand where things are not going right. A memorandum of understanding has been signed with the insurance companies which says the OPW will provide Insurance Ireland with detailed background and technical information on all completed OPW flood relief schemes, including maps showing the extent of the area provided. To date, it has provided that information on 16 schemes which have been completed by the Office of Public Works. Insurance Ireland has undertaken that member companies will take into account all information given to them by the OPW. There is an issue with temporary flood defences which we will take up with Insurance Ireland.</p>

It will be surprising and disappointing to households and businesses that have been flooded or are at risk of flooding and whose insurance companies refuse to insure them when their premiums are coming up for renewal, that Deputy Canney, as Minister of State, has not decided to lift the telephone to members of the insurance industry to ask them to get a grip on the situation, to talk with them to ensure they continue to renew such premiums until a plan is put in place.</p>

We have to make sure that we get the works done by whatever means necessary and to short circuit it as quickly as possible. Humanitarian aid is being given but at the same time, people need to be reassured that if a flood event occurs, everything is made available to help them and to ease the problem if their house or land gets flooded or if their roads are impassable.

          <p eId="para_134">Deputy Doherty queried the additional spending, an increase of 400% on the acquisition of sites. One cannot decide not to buy a property because it was not in the original Estimate. One does not know at the start of the year what will come on the market, and one buys sites that are deemed to be of strategic importance when the opportunity arises. We have made the following acquisitions: Enterprise House, Benamore Business Park, Roscrea, Caltra carpark in Sligo, Bailieborough new Garda station, a house adjoining our property in Clontuskert, County Roscommon, and property for Garda stations in Talavera, County Tipperary and Dunlavin County Wicklow. Sometimes one buys a property when it comes on the market, one has to move rather than sit on one's hands and end up regretting it for the rest of one's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> In respect of the President's household, the overspend was on staff replacements when people retire.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">My final question is linked to the acquisition of property. It was interesting that the Minister of State referred to the acquisition of sites for Garda stations. He said one needs to move when properties come on the market instead of regretting it for the rest of one's life. Obviously the OPW screwed up royally when it did not purchase the Garda Síochána regional headquarters at Harcourt Square, the nerve centre of the Garda Síochána, given that the annual rent is €5 million. It went on the market under the control of NAMA and was sold at a low cost. There is an attempt to evict the Garda at the end of their lease. In 2013, we called on the OPW to purchase that office block but the then Minister said it would be inappropriate for him to comment. Did the OPW ever consider purchasing the office block? More important, have we a contingency for the 800 Garda personnel currently working in that office block? I understand that a long-term site may be identified in Kilmainham that could cost anything up to €60 million. Will he confirm the figures that have been in the public domain? What will happen in the short term, because I understand an application for planning permission has not been lodged for the Kilmainham site? Will he outline the steps that will be taken to activate that site? What will happen if the court case fails and the REIT that owns Harcourt Square secures the eviction of the OPW when the four leases come to an end in the middle of this year?</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I think it is better not to comment on the legal proceedings. I was not a Member of the Dáil in 2013 but I will find out if the OPW put in a bid and revert to Deputy Doherty on that, unless someone wishes to answer it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> As he mentioned, there is a site being considered so that we own a property and do not end up in a situation where a lease runs out again. That site is on Military Road, Kilmainham and is going for planning under Part 9. It will be a number of years before that will come into being. I think there are contingency plans being formulated but we must await the outcome of the court case.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">This is important because in the context of the Estimates, we are considering real expenditure. I am not asking the Minister of State to comment on the High Court proceedings. The decision will be made by the court but we need to ensure there are contingencies built into the Estimates. Have we identified a short-term facility that will allow us to relocate the Garda nerve centre from Harcourt Court to a suitable location, should the High Court uphold the decision not to renew the lease. Is there provision for such a contingency fund built into the Estimates? Will the personnel currently in Harcourt Street be accommodated? The suggestion is that the proposal accommodation near the port tunnel has the capacity to accommodate only half the total number of staff in Harcourt Court. That is not suitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">Why not? The four leases expire in the middle of the year. If the OPW loses the court case, the Garda Síochána have to leave the office block and it will be difficult to find an alternative property that is suitable for the nerve centre of the Garda. I assume there will be additional costs. How does the OPW deal with the administration of all of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_144">Rent is being paid under the existing lease, and should the Garda headquarters be required to leave that rent money is still available. The OPW is looking at all the options; perhaps some of the units could be houses in existing available space where there would be no need to pay rent.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I appreciate that the €5 million rent could be used to rent another building but let us be clear, Harcourt Square is the nerve centre of the Garda, it is where CAB is located. It is not just a case of going to another building, but replacing the entire infrastructure that has been built up over many years. When one looks at the allocation for refurbishments, it does not include a sum to meet the amount of money that would be required to fit out a temporary building for An Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I wish the Chairman the very best in his role and I wish the Minister of State the best in his Department over the coming months. The catchment flood risk and assessment, CFRAM, report was documented in the Minister of State's opening remarks. Essentially, he has already pointed out that urban areas will be best served by the report in terms of requirements and conditions. I am just concerned about rural areas. What programme of works has been put in place for them and what budget is prescribed? There is much concern that rural areas will be left behind by the report and no works will be carried out. We have had a huge disaster in terms of the scale of flooding but no work has yet commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Subhead A5 relates to flood risk management and I note that, almost halfway through the year at the end of May, less than 8% of the allocated budget has been expended. Considering there was a €7 million carry-over from the previous year, that would concern me greatly. We really need to get our act together. I am interested in why it is so far behind. The Minister of State mentioned that local authorities with minor works programmes could carry out some work for rural areas. It seems there has been a trend away from that recently in the Department, as noted in the report. Will the Minister of State comment on those points?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_95" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">As I stated, the CFRAM is concentrating on areas of population. Other areas are being dealt with under the budget through minor works schemes proposed by local authorities. They can run to €500,000. I do not have the figures with me but between 2009 and 2015, there were 514 schemes done that way, with €30 million expended on minor works schemes in that time. There is no let-up with the minor works schemes. I encourage all local authorities which can identify schemes to submit them to the Office of Public Works as the money is there to carry them out. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> The Deputy's question related to spending money, particularly what has been spent and what will be spent during the year. As a result of rules and regulations, there are certain windows of opportunity in which we can carry out works and there are certain times when it cannot be done. In the river areas, July to September is a window in which we can carry out works. We cannot go into the rivers outside that time. There is a certain amount of work done before moving on. We do as much as possible in the window but then we have to wait for the next window. It is a bit like doing the hedge trimming on the roads, which is governed by the bird nesting season. The rivers also have rules and regulations. Sometimes with flood relief schemes there is a stop-go issue, which is why it takes longer to carry out a project. It is not an ongoing process but seasonal. Since the end of May, additional spending of up to €10 million has been used.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">It is simplistic to say the money is in the Office of Public Works for local authorities to move forward and identify projects. Taking the scale of the Shannon, local authorities may not have the expertise to formulate solutions for rural aspects. The Minister of State mentioned that the CFRAM report is centred on urban populations but in rural areas, have we identified projects specifically for the Shannon that we can carry out, with money there to do it? Under the minor works scheme, I fear authorities will not have the capacity to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">In the preliminary flood assessments, the CFRAM report identified 300 areas across the country, effectively all the centres of population. It considers proposed measures for those. Major schemes may come out from it, and we will carry those, perhaps in co-operation with the local authority. It may identify minor works in some of those areas but outside that, if there are further works that the local authorities wish to carry out, they can do it with their own funding, if they have it, or apply under the minor works scheme. The criteria for that are on our website. As the Minister of State has indicated, we have completed over 540 of those, with spending of €35 million in the six or seven years since 2009. I told the Minister of State the wrong number. It is a very good support for local authorities in helping them with those issues, with small centres and smaller protection is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">In terms of the heritage properties, there would have been a slight reduction in staffing levels during the recession period when the recruitment embargo was in place. Each site is managed on an individual basis according to need. The presentation of each site is under review at all times and in some cases we have increased staff numbers. That was the case with Kilmainham Gaol, for example, where staff numbers were increased in the context of the 2016 commemoration programme. We rejuvenated and renovated the adjoining courthouse to increase the offering to the public and, as the Minister of State said, we are aiming to have 500,000 visitors at that site per annum. We also recently introduced online booking for Kilmainham Gaol. That is just one example of a site where the staffing cadre was reviewed as part of the development process. There are other sites throughout the country where we will also be attempting to rejuvenate the staffing cadre over the coming weeks and months but it all depends on resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I assume the Chairman is referring to the property maintenance area. We have been looking at alternative ways, given staffing restrictions, of doing things like securing buildings. There is an argument that engaging private sector security companies provides more flexibility as against having people based permanently at individual sites. That is an option we are considering on a case by case basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this matter because there are potential costs to the State. It is not reflected in the Estimates, but it is a potential cost, whether legal or compensatory, to the State and it needs to be sorted out. Going down that legal route is one step beyond common sense. The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, wants to bring change to that Department and I would suggest that outstanding matters, such as those with a potential liability, should be dealt with. I hope the note I gave will inform the Minister of State and that he will be able to resolve the issues. It is very important that we do not leave it on the long finger because it is not reflected here in the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> How it will be dealt with is a matter for the office, but I ask the Minister of State not to follow the line that it has gone down the legal route because that is merely parking it and sending it to a cul-de-sac. It is a tactic used by many Departments in order not to deal with a matter. I hope that between now and the meeting, which we hope to hold with the Minister of State and his officials in September, that particular matter at least can be brought to a head one way or the other in a common sense way.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Regarding the insurance issues that were addressed earlier by other members, there are properties and businesses along the River Nore in Kilkenny that have been destroyed. They are turning to the State for assistance because they could not get insurance and they are not covered by insurance. The fund made available by the Minister does not go to next or near putting them back in business. What is the Department's policy position on those few numbers of businesses, possibly dotted around the country, that are attempting to get back into business, that cannot get insurance and that are looking to the State for some sort of assistance to deal with their issues? Is there a fund or is there a way that the Minister of State can examine these issues with a view to resolving them?</p>

It includes looking at all aspects of the flooding issue, including areas of compensation for receding ground and voluntary relocation. A report will be brought to Government on that, including recommendations on how to deal with those who have found themselves, through no fault of their own, in a situation where they cannot get insurance.</p>

There will be a public consultation process during which people can look at it and see what is being proposed. By the end of the year, that will be published.

There are approximately 11,500 km of channel around the country to be maintained and this is done by our regional staff in Trim, Limerick and Headford. It is not exactly on a cyclical basis but they maintain most of the channels in a cycle of about five years, so one comes out with about 2,200 km and the associated structures that would be on that in terms of embankments. That is planned through our maintenance and detailed planning of that goes into what is needed.

          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_285">I am joined by my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and officials from my Department. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the 2016 Estimates for my Department’s group of Votes. The group comprises a significant number of Votes and is as follows: the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Vote for the Office of Government Procurement and the Vote for the National Shared Services Office; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department – the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service and the Office of the Ombudsman; and (iii) the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and for the Secret Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> The Vote for the remaining element of the public expenditure and reform, PER, group, that is for the Office of Public Works, was dealt with by the committee this morning. The structure of the PER Vote remains unchanged in 2016 from last year, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform. The requested resources for each programme, in terms of staffing and funding, are set out in part III of the Estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> As regards the first of these programmes, the objective of which is to manage public expenditure at more sustainable levels in a planned, rational and balanced manner in support of Ireland’s economic performance and social progress, the committee will be aware of the timetable envisaged by the Government in regard to the 2017 Estimates process, including the forthcoming national economic dialogue, the summer statement and the process of arriving at the various components of budget 2017 due in October.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The 3% increase in gross spend on this Vote to bring total gross allocation to €45.9 million is required primarily in the second programme of my Department – public service management and reform, which has as its objective “to formulate and promote policies which drive efficiency, effectiveness and reform across the public service”. The additional allocation is largely related to the provision for investment in a resilient and robust technical platform on which to deliver build-to-share applications and Government cloud services as part of the remit of the Office of Government Chief Information Officer. Provision is also made for funding of the Civil Service learning and development shared services project, which will deliver a shared model of learning and development across the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> In the above regard, I emphasise that public service reform has been, and will continue to be, an essential element of how we respond to the challenges and opportunities in building for our future. The public service reform plan 2014-2016 has a strong focus on service improvement and the delivery of improved outcomes for service users. Substantial progress has been made across a range of areas in terms of reducing costs, delivering better value for money and improving services. A comprehensive progress report on the implementation of the Public Service Reform Plan 2014-16 was published in April. </p>
          <p eId="para_290"> A Civil Service Renewal Plan was published in October 2014 and the implementation of this ambitious three year plan is leading to major changes right across Departments and Government offices. The plan provides a framework to deliver a more unified, responsive, professional and open and accountable Civil Service, with the aim of providing a world-class service to the State. It is supporting the future development of the Civil Service so that it has the capacity and capability to meet demands. Significant progress has been made. However, we must build on this progress and maintain a focus on public reform over the coming years. It is essential that as we move forward to recruit more people into the public services, plans for which are under way, this runs in tandem with further continuing efforts to reform how we deliver public services. Recruitment and reform must continue to go hand in hand. In addition to overseeing the final phase of the implementation of the current reform plan I have asked my Department to initiate the development of the next phase of public service reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_291"> In tandem with the developments which I have just outlined, the reform and delivery office, RDO, within my Department is overseeing and driving the reform programme across the civil and public services. It is, of course, often necessary to invest in the short term to facilitate change and savings in the medium term. For this reason, the RDO has been allocated €1.4 million in 2016 from the reform agenda fund. It has been used to fund the following - conduct the Civil Service customer satisfaction survey; complete the next phase of implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan; publish the first datasets on the non-profit sector on the benefacts website; and support the delivery of service improvements through alternative and innovative delivery models. My Department will use these resources to continue to work with all Departments and offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I will now turn to the issue of public service pay. From 2009 to 2013 the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, FEMPI, introduced pay reduction measures. These measures, together with the public service pension reduction, PSPR, are estimated to have resulted in over €2.2 billion in direct reductions in public service remuneration and pensions annually. Any sudden elimination of the FEMPI measures is not feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> The Government has, through the negotiation and agreement of a financially prudent public service agreement on pay and related issues, provided for a gradual unwinding of the FEMPI measures as they apply to public servants. The terms of this agreement, the Lansdowne Road agreement, were accepted by the vast majority of public servants and are being implemented under the FEMPI 2015 Act with effect from 1 January 2016 at a full year cost of €844 million by 2018. Additional provision has also been made for the amelioration of the PSPR for public service pensioners at an additional full year cost of €90 million in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is the best way forward to meet the needs of those who work in our public service and of those who depend upon them. In addition to progress in public service reform, we have been pursuing a wide-ranging reform programme aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to help rebuild trust in Government and in the institutions of the State. Progress made includes the commencement of the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 on 1 September 2015. There are more than 1,300 organisations and individuals who have registered, and just over 4,500 returns have been submitted to the register. A substantial review of the effectiveness and efficiency of Ireland’s current ethics framework has been undertaken, including consideration of the recommendations of the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals and other relevant recommendations, as well as international best practice. I expect to publish a draft scheme of a Bill later this year, following the approval by the Government. My Department is drafting the Data Sharing and Governance Bill on the basis of heads agreed by Government in July 2015. The aim of this legislation is to simplify the legal basis for data-sharing between public service bodies while delivering stronger governance arrangements to protect the rights of individuals. In November 2015, the Department published the corporate governance standard for the Civil Service. This followed from a commitment in the Civil Service renewal plan to strengthen corporate governance in the Civil Service in line with international best practice. Departments and offices are required to develop their governance frameworks in line with the standard which requires them for the first time to document and publish their governance arrangements, the core elements of which are identified in the standard. These frameworks, which have now been published, set out how each Department and office does its work. In addition, my Department is leading on Ireland’s open data initiative, which forms a core element of the Office of Government Procurement’s national action plan. That office is an important element of Government’s overall reform programme and is tasked with delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data, and improving the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service. The net funding allocation for the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, in 2016 is estimated at €19.982 million, compared to €18.974 million in 2015. A portion of this funding reflects budget transfers from the national public procurement policy unit and national procurement service, functions that previously resided in my Department’s Vote and in the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The office continues to lead the implementation of the programme for procurement reform. In the three years to the end of 2015, the OGP and its partner sector sourcing organisations in health, education, local government enabled procurement savings in excess of €160 million. Projected savings for the next three years are in the range of €80 million to €100 million per annum for the programme as a whole. The office is increasingly called upon to support key priority programmes such as the re-negotiation of the pharmaceutical agreement with industry, rapid build housing, the Garda safety camera network and large scale IT projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The national shared services office within my Department is leading the shared services strategy and the implementation of such projects within the overall reform and renewal context. This office is directly responsible for overseeing shared services projects within the Civil Service and provides expert guidance and support to other public service sectors in progressing their shared services commitments. Solid progress has been made: PeoplePoint, the Civil Service human resources and pensions administration shared service centre, now services more than 33,300 employees across 38 public service bodies; and the payroll shared service centre services 92,000 payees, including pensioners, from 41 organisations and the financial management shared services project has commenced the design phase. The centre is scheduled to begin providing financial management services in early 2018 and by 2020 will service 48 public sector bodies. A provision of €37.9 million is sought for Vote 18, shared services. These areas require upfront investment but will yield economies and efficiencies in the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">PeoplePoint will become fully operational in 2016 while the transitioning of payroll shared services will reach a conclusion by November 2017. The financial management project will pilot next year and will be fully operational two or three years after.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> Vote 12 refers to the superannuation and retired allowances. It primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sum costs for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependants. Year to year variations in expenditure on this Vote is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose years of service and grade and-or pay level are variable and uncertain.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> The majority of persons covered by the Vote, once they reach the age of 60, may opt to retire at any stage before reaching compulsory retirement age, which is generally 65. Some people may opt to retire earlier than 60 under the terms of the cost neutral early retirement arrangements whereby they may receive an actuarially reduced pension. In addition, there can be retirements due to ill health as well as persons becoming eligible to claim preserved pension benefits arising from previous employment within the Civil Service. The Estimate that I am proposing today involves a net provision of €391.88 million and represents an increase of just over €5 million, or 1%, on the net Estimate 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The select committee has been supplied with detailed briefing by my Department's officials on the various Votes in the PER group, including those for the sub-office of my Department. As I mentioned earlier, the Vote for the Office of Public Works is handled separately by the select committee. I thank the Chairman and members for their time. I will be happy to answer any questions that may arise. </p>

        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_219">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_301">I wish to open this meeting as I did the earlier one with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Canney. In the earlier session, we dealt with an Estimate of roughly €370 million and in this session, we are dealing with an Estimate worth €392 million, which is a substantial amount of money. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has spoken in glowing terms of the reform that is taking place in the wider Civil Service and yet we, as a select committee, are expected to operate under Standing Order 90. The committee is only empowered to consider the Estimates and cannot alter, amend or vote on them. The committee must send a message to the Dáil when it has completed its consideration of the Estimates and it cannot decide not to do this. Under Standing Order 90, the message must be to the effect that the select committee has completed its consideration of an Estimate referred to it by the Dáil. There is no provision for the expression of an opinion by the committee on the Estimates in its message. As the Standing Order prescribes the nature of the message to be sent, the content is not a matter for decision by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> I read that note out in the last session and have done so again because reform of the Civil Service, etc., is part of the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This session is a farce. It is a box ticking exercise. There is a perception that we examine Estimates here and send a message of our own accord back to the Dáil but that does not happen. We do not have the time and we are due to finish today at 12 noon. That means we are confined by time and Standing Order 90. This is a box ticking exercise and we have no real input. This is a bit theatre in terms of examining the Estimates. This is an appalling way to do the business of the select committee. I know this is not the fault of the Minister and I know we are going through a period of discussing reform. If ever a system needed reform, it is this one. It is a farce and is not working. Members will get into the generalities of Estimates but we do not have the time to drill down into figures and analyse them. That is regrettable in what we describe as an era of new politics. It is just the same old, same old and something urgent needs to be done to rectify the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> As Deputy Cullinane said earlier, this matter is not about the officials. However, when officials appear here, their names do not appear on the screens. The officials have no objection to that. It would be helpful for the committee members to know the officials, their responsibilities and to name them as they speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> We must be mature in our efforts to examine the Estimates in a restricted timeframe and process. It is like being placed in a political straitjacket and being told what to do. One can neither act nor speak and the same message will go back to the Dáil. That is my view of the matter. I hope the Minister, within the Cabinet, particularly given his experience on committees - the same goes for his Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy - we will see the type of change necessary to really deal with these Estimates. I have placed my views on record because I believe that to be the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_220" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_305">I thank the Chairman for his views. I agree with some of what he has said but not with all of it. Clearly, it would have been ideal if we had been in a position to begin this process earlier in the year. We would have had time to form broader committees. We would have had an opportunity to work through the Estimates in the detail anticipated by the Chairman, which I am happy to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> A challenge we would have been faced with is that if we had brought Votes through the plenary session of the Dáil, there would have been no opportunity for questions to be put to me and would only have had statements, which would have been even more unsatisfactory. It is my hope that when we get into a more normal process, when all of the committees have been formed, that we will be able to engage in this in a detailed manner and on an ongoing basis. I will play my part in the process. I will always be available to the Chairman's committee to come in and answer questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> With respect, there is one matter on which I differ from the Chairman. The Constitution clearly assigns roles and responsibilities. The Executive, or the Government, has some responsibilities that it has to play in terms of money Bills. Under the Constitution, we are required to perform certain duties. Certainly, inside that framework, as a clear consequence of our status as a minority Government and the arrangement we have with the Dáil and with the Chairman's party, we have to do more now to take on board the views of other parties in the Dáil when it comes to how we form a budget and what it should contain. I will do all that I can to facilitate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">There is a need to change Standing Orders and there is an urgent need to reform the committee system. All of this has nothing to do with minority or majority governments because it is the people who have spoken. They have given us this result and we need to respond. The committee system has been like this for many years - I do not know how long. The system has to be changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">There is no company in the country from which we collect taxes that would pass budgets within an hour and without the type of debate that I expect is necessary when dealing with a budget of €370 million. I am lobbying both the Minister and his Minister of State, as both of them know the committee system, to bring about the necessary changes. It would allow us, as members of the committee and Members of the Parliament, to do our work. The current system prevents us from doing so. We are fooling the public because they believe that we examine the Estimates when, in fact, they are only considered. The message that we send back is already pre-determined. This system is a farce.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">Yes. I somewhat agree with the Chairman's concerns and echo some of them. We are confined to asking questions about the Minister's statement. As the Chairman has said, we are asked to consider the Estimates under different Votes. It is in that context that I looked at the headings in the Minister's opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> My first question is on public sector pay. The Minister quite rightly stated that the Lansdowne Road agreement will be in place up to September 2018. As I have said before, my party has given qualified support to the implementation of the agreement. My question on pay is linked to the summer economic statement released yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The latter set out the net fiscal space for the next five years. For 2017 and 2018, it is exclusive of the Lansdowne Road agreement. There was no provision in yesterday's statement for any further public sector pay restoration. The Minister has indicated the Lansdowne Road agreement is a way of setting out an agreed pathway to pay restoration and I presume he is speaking about the period up to 2018. There will be a difficult issue confronting all of us - members of the committee, Members of the Dáil and the people of the State - with regard to the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation. Those cuts were brought in - the Minister indicated the amount involved was €2.2 billion - and I am not in favour of scrapping the FEMPI legislation in one go either, as that would not be possible when considered in the context of the State's revenue. It will be somewhat problematic for the Minister to say we will scrap the universal social charge over five years, while putting €3 billion into a rainy day fund and not making any provision for any restoration of pay in the period 2019 to 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> We can all accept there must be some level of pay restoration in those years so it would be more honest of the Government to indicate the available current spend for the years - the fiscal space - but within that there must be some provision for more pay restoration in the public service. How can the State justify saying there is still an emergency with how it deals with public sector pay when it is seeking to put money aside for a rainy day fund and abolish taxes of up to €5 billion in the form of the universal social charge? There are trade unions already saying they will challenge this in the courts. I am not asking the Minister to give away a negotiating position or a figure, but will he at least concede that for the years 2019 to 2021, inclusive, we will have to make provisions for pay restoration beyond the Lansdowne Road agreement?</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Public procurement was also mentioned in the Minister's statement. In the past we spoke a great deal about opening public procurement to small businesses and making it easier for them. Does the Minister or the Department have any plans for reform in the area? It was not set out in the statement so will the Minister give us his view on it? I also have a question on capital investment, which was also mentioned in the statement. I acknowledge there was some increased investment in capital announced yesterday and I welcome that, as far as it goes. The stability programme update contains figures charting revenue and expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, for the next five years. Both revenue and expenditure decreased as a percentage of GDP year on year. That factored in the Government's planned budgetary proposals, which includes tax cuts. One must accept that we have one of the lowest capital investment spends as a percentage of GDP already in the European Union and yet it is going to decrease year on year. Those figures did not appear in yesterday's statement, so will the Minister comment on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> I have a technical question for the Minister. With regard to capital investment, we are also providing for what is called the smoothing of the capital formation. If, in a budget, we provide for €1 billion in additional capital spending, would it be smoothed over four years, meaning it would only eat into a quarter of the fiscal space? If that is the case, some of the money earmarked for capital expenditure would already be spent in a previous year, so there may not be an accurate reflection of what is to be spent in a given year. Will the Minister outline how the smoothing process works and also explain the logic behind it?</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> The next point relates to the flexibility of European Union rules. The Taoiseach has spoken about this, as did one of the Minister's MEP colleagues, when there was a request for the European Commission to be more flexible. The Minister's party and other parties agreed the fiscal rules in the first instance but it is interesting that there is now a call, even from the Taoiseach, to relax the fiscal rules. What is the Minister's view on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_330">I will deal with each of the Deputy's questions in turn. The short answer to his technical question is that, yes, capital expenditure is treated in a different way to current expenditure and smoothed over a four-year period. The figures outlined by the Deputy are approximately correct. That is the way it works and €1 of expenditure would have a smaller effect on how much of the fiscal space it absorbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The Deputy put different points in respect of pay and choices made. We are still in the very early stages of the current wage agreement negotiated with the public service. It is a three-year agreement and there are still active issues that we are managing in the context of working to get unions and other groups into it. The vast majority of unions and public civil servants have voted to be part of the agreement. Is it funded across the next number of years? The Deputy was correct earlier and the answer is "Yes". The figures quoted as part of the fiscal space relate, of course, to the net fiscal space. Growth fiscal space across the coming years includes the provision for paying for the Lansdowne Road agreement, as it does for commitments relating to the public capital programme. In the context of the aftermath of our current wage agreement - the Lansdowne Road agreement - and how we will deal with it, there will be a replacement to it. Such an agreement will come into play when the current one concludes. If I indicated the provision, I would prejudge the kind of negotiations that I and this Government will have with stakeholders in the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I was not asking about that. I was just asking the Minister to at least confirm that there would have to be some provision for the years 2019 to 2021, inclusive, for some level of pay restoration. I did not ask the amount.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">The principle outlined by the Deputy is correct in that if there is to be a future agreement to replace the current one, we must have the ability to pay for it. We will have that ability but I will deal with the issue of how much of our future financial flexibility could be absorbed by it when we get to the conclusion of the current agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I thank the Deputy for acknowledging the increase in capital investment, which was confirmed yesterday. We had a commitment to increase investment by an additional €4 billion and I confirmed yesterday that I would inform the Oireachtas that we are seeking to increase that to €5 billion, an extra €1 billion. It is my expectation that when the latter is in place, we will see capital expenditure increase from approximately 3.4% to 3.9% of national income. There will be an increase on the current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> We can consider how this compares to where we were previously. We can begin to compare capital investment as a percentage of national income to where we were in the run-up to the tiger period and across that time, when we spent approximately €9 billion per year, for example, in completing our national road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">However, I do not think that is an appropriate base to use. There was a very large amount of investment in that period in putting in place a national road network but one of the consequences was that parts of our economy overheated. I am confident that when we rebuild our investment, as I proposed yesterday, there will be a sustainable level of capital investment in our economy which I am confident will then trigger further investment from the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I was asked about the flexibility of the European Union rules and we have already discussed smoothing, as well as differentiating between current and capital expenditure, which would be an important recognition of the different types of expenditure. In the future, what I require is consistency in the way these things are implemented. If something is treated as a public-private partnership now, I am confident this will be the case in the future. Consistency will be important to this and other Governments in the coming years. </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2016-06-22T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_338">I fully agree with the Minister's opening comments. I sat on the Dáil reform committee and we gave as much thought as we could to reforming the committee system to enable it to work in conjunction with the Government and the rest of the Oireachtas on matters like these. Delegated time for committees, separate from plenary time, such as we have today was part of that, and any recommendations would be very helpful to the reform committee as it seeks to improve the process next year. We are changing a lot of things at the moment and the reform committee will become a standing committee to continue to look at how we do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> There was a question on Government procurement and SMEs, which is a very pertinent issue. Some 66% of public money in this area goes to small and medium enterprises but we can still do better. Members will be aware that Directive 2014/24 has been transposed here. This directive looks at ways more Government business could go to small and medium enterprises around the country, such as with e-tendering and consortia bidding. In addition, financial capacity requirements are less onerous, generally being twice the contract value. In these ways we are trying to encourage SMEs to bid and help them to be successful. We have all heard stories from companies who have found difficulties in this process so the Office of Government Procurement has increased its outreach and now it goes out to meet businesses and holds meet-the-buyer events and tender events, at a recent one of which there were some 500 people. It is a very positive and proactive engagement. I want to make sure I am in the position where I can hear if there are problems with certain businesses. I would like to help people work through these problems and Deputies from all parties and none have already come to me to ask me to do that. I will roll this out from September.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> The programme for Government has a couple of interesting commitments which aim to increase capacity in this regard. One relates to reviewing the tender advisory service, something we want to do by 2017. Another is a consultation on the possibility of setting up a procurement ombudsman. This could be a very positive development if it is done in the right way but it could also have downsides. We are working within EU constraints but we are trying to make it more accessible for small and medium enterprises. It is difficult for companies and businesses who, in the past, had Government contracts but have now found that, with the new arrangements to save money for the taxpayer and State, they are not as successful as in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Under the terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement, when any new process or modality is being developed to look at issues pertinent to the agreement, I am required to consult with all stakeholders, by which I mean signatories, before I conclude it. It is my objective to begin the consultation with the signatories to the Lansdowne Road agreement soon, by which I mean within the coming weeks, to get their views regarding what role they can play. The process could play a role in examining the question of the pay of new entrants in certain parts of the civil and public service but I would need the input of the signatories first. The Deputy will be familiar with the concept of relativity and will know that when something changes in one area of our civil and public service it has many consequences in other parts. Many unions in the Lansdowne Road process have views on this matter and have already articulated them and I will have to take them into account too.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">The outputs will be recommendations but not ones by which the Government is necessarily bound. The rationale for this is that it is absolutely vital in any work we do that we do not remove the ability of a Government employer to negotiate directly with its employees. I do not want negotiations on the future being handled by an entity that is not the Government. I do not believe that would be appropriate and I believe some of the concerns about accountability which were outlined by the Chairman earlier would be exacerbated in such an eventuality. On the terms of reference, I need to seek the views of signatories and I will, of course, consult with the Oireachtas on this point. On the timing, I envisage it will take some months to get the views of signatories on the work of the commission so I will want to get the ball rolling within this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">That is correct. The clear view of the Government is that any matters relating to public service pay will be dealt with inside the Lansdowne Road agreement and it is working to bring groups into the agreement. I would say that the Lansdowne Road agreement framework offers plenty of processes and ways in which we can deal with the issues people are raising. Amidst the understandable focus on groups outside the agreement, I point to the progress that has been made recently, with the TUI voting with a large turnout and a large majority to join the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>

My questions concern the Vote before us, but before I put them I will make a broad point about the need for this committee to make time for a discussion on the summer economic statement and the recent report of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. Notwithstanding the time constraints we face today, I would welcome the opportunity to have a broader discussion on the very macroeconomic issues that affect us all, particularly how the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform fits into that firmament, because there are legitimate questions relating to the summer economic statement concerning the costings for 2017 of recent announcements such as the Revised Estimate for health and the €200 million local investment fund for local authorities. On the latter, we need an opportunity to interrogate the modalities of that scheme and its cost in terms of public expenditure but also in respect of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I appreciate that. Other issues include medium-term objectives and the stability programme update. These are all issues that this committee needs to have time to discuss with the Minister, so I appreciate that and I thank the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> The EU referendum in Great Britain is on the horizon. In respect of subheads A6 and A8 and the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, which is within the Minister's Department, we have given a lot of resources and time to ensuring that this North-South body is adequately funded and that the PEACE programme is funded adequately from an EU perspective. Has the Minister a view on the effect on those programmes if the UK exits the EU? Subhead A8 concerns the Ireland Wales Territorial Co-operation Programme. I am very worried that if the UK exits the EU it will have a profound effect on programmes operating on a North-South basis from both a social and an economic point of view. I would welcome the Minister's perspective on that. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> In respect of procurement, I note that reference was made to savings of €80 million to €100 million and previous savings. I have a worry about Irish SMEs. I note that there has been a lot of work done with regard to the local enterprise offices and "meet the buyer" events and so on, and savings have been made. Has the Department calculated whether more Irish SMEs have taken up this opportunity and whether pre-existing Irish companies and SMEs have been crowded out by virtue of the fact that they lack the economies of scale required to compete for business? I make specific reference to the education sector, where there is anecdotal evidence that companies that supplied arts and crafts supplies, books and other products in the education sphere feel they will not be able to retain the market share they had and are being crowded out by the new regime for procuring savings. I do not necessarily need an answer to that today. I am just putting down a marker, and we might have a further discussion on it because there are companies that are feeling a bit of pressure in that space.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Is PeoplePoint operating at full capacity? Have the individual line Departments' HR and payment functions migrated to PeoplePoint in a seamless fashion? We all acknowledge that there will be a lag on that and that there will be issues that must be dealt with, but I would like to hear the Minister's perspective on whether PeoplePoint is up and running and whether it is responding to individual workers' queries in a timely fashion. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> In respect of Vote 19, provision is made for issues such as prisoner complaints, clinical judgments and direct provision to be dealt with by the Office of the Ombudsman. I understand it has a budget of €9.7 million. Will the Office of the Ombudsman have an expanded role? Is the cost of this being met in respect of the potential need for increased personnel to deal with an expanded service? </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I have a bugbear concerning our own services here. Our own IT infrastructure has not migrated to the cloud. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing a very good job of ensuring that build-to-share and cloud service platforms are built through the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. I note the statement relating to data mining and so on. Is this is a matter for further discussion somewhere down the line? We could discuss how the Oireachtas operates in respect of our own ICT infrastructure and making loose systems available, because the systems we are operating at the moment are a bit anachronistic and arcane and might need to be looked at. That is a very minor issue, but I said I would take the opportunity to raise it with the Minister while he was here. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I welcome the comments on the opening up of a dialogue with the public sector unions on the commission. The Minister made a very clear statement about how any sudden elimination of the FEMPI measures is not feasible. I was hoping for more time today to discuss the summer economic statement, the fiscal space and the new moneys that appear to have been made available, because I wonder whether there is scope to accelerate the unwinding of FEMPI, given the increased resources that would appear to be available as an outcome of the summer economic statement.</p>

Of course, I am very much aware of the role played by Deputy Sherlock in his previous role negotiating the Fresh Start agreement and the further progress that was made in Northern Ireland. The short answer to his question is that if the UK votes to leave the EU, these programmes will be affected. There are two particular dimensions to these programmes that will be affected. As the Deputy is aware, the first is the fact that the EU provides most of the funding for them. Second, the requirement for State investment in these areas is front-loaded - the investment is at the start.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">This is one of the many reasons we have campaigned for the British people to vote to remain in the EU. I recognise that it is their sovereign right. We have referendums here all the time, and I am conscious of how we feel when people visit our country, but programmes like this will have an effect. I do not want to quantify the effect because we have to see how the United Kingdom will vote on Thursday, and I will not get into specifying the figures in that respect because I do not want to be involved in the debate in any way beyond the Government’s involvement already. Funding streams such as this are predicated on countries being in the European Union. </p>

          <p eId="para_367">There are four more Departments to go. We believe we are on track to move most target Departments in, and the benefit of that is that when PeoplePoint is fully up and running and all the target organisations are in, it will deliver €3.7 million in savings per year. The objective is that all the transactions being conducted by individual Departments will be moved to a central unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The Deputy is correct in saying there are some areas into which the Ombudsman is due to move and have a role, such as direct provision. That will come into effect from 1 November 2016. Other areas will include prisoner complaints, as supported by the Department of Justice and Equality. A possible area of expansion will be into the area of clinical judgments. When this happens it will affect staff numbers for next year and not this year, so we will deal with that in the context of the Estimates for 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I have made a very explicit statement about FEMPI: there is an additional cost to the Exchequer of €1.4 billion of current expenditure. We cannot accelerate the Lansdowne Road agreement or the change of FEMPI. Anything that can be done has to be done in a graduated and sustainable manner. For those reasons, the Lansdowne Road agreement and its architecture are vital to managing all of the competing demands on our public finances.</p>

It is incredibly frustrating to have these problems. I have learned that the Oireachtas maintains some independence in respect of an ambition or drive to share services in this area. There is a great Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and a new person has been appointed to that role who has very ambitious plans for a government cloud, which we will move on this year. There is money allocated in the subheads for that. A challenge will be to bring the Oireachtas in as part of that, if that is the appropriate thing to do, but it has to be considered because there is a view that the pillars should be separate - for example, the services given to the Oireachtas versus the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">I am not criticising anybody working within our IT system here. The system is what it is. If Government is talking about open data, open government and the system we operate as a parliament, compared with others such as the Estonian parliament, which has moved lock, stock and barrel into the cloud, then - while I note there may be security issues, with firewalling and whatnot - we need to bring our system kicking and screaming into this century, because I contend that it uses last-century technology. If the Minister can have an open mind about that and, in his responsibility for public expenditure and reform, ensure that we make our system fit for purpose, that will send a signal.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">The Deputy is right to cite Estonia as a model. I am meeting the ambassador, if not this week then next week, to talk about all that has been done there because people from industry cite it as best in class. The Deputy is dead right to talk about open data. I have had several conversations with the Government Chief Information Officer about what we can do with data. The communications service the Oireachtas gives to the public is very good, but the service we encounter here can be very difficult. We need to balance the two. On open data, there are some exciting forums coming up in the autumn, such as hackathons and forums for sharing data, making it more accessible and making it work better for the public and inside Government services. </p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The procurement question about market share is very pertinent. Although 66% of public services expenditure in 2013 went to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, I do not have the figure for 2014. As we increase our spend, we want to ensure SMEs are accessing and winning as much as they can. The EU directive on consortium bidding was intended to make it possible for them to compete against bigger players. Anecdotally, I have heard that it has not been as successful as we had hoped. That is what I am looking into.</p>

          <p eId="para_384"> In 2015 there were 21,794 people in receipt of the payments covered by the superannuation Vote, and in 2016 that went up to 22,825.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The largest subheads of that were in regard to overall superannuations, namely, pension payments, which went to 15,400 in 2016.

          <p eId="para_387">No. The reason for that is that the earlier figure I gave includes people who are in receipt of pensions already, whereas the figure cited by the Deputy of 2,400 - I will be corrected by an official if I am wrong - will mostly focus on people who are exiting the Civil Service and public service who are about to join the fund. To put it more plainly, the 2,400 figure might be interpreted as new beneficiaries of the fund. They are people who are exiting the public service who are then having their pension rights determined.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">Deputy Burke's question on e-Tenders is a good one. In relation to the work we are trying to do, we are trying to make this facility for tendering and procurement more accessible and easier for small companies and enterprises. Recently, a study was published on the number of Irish businesses that do not have an online presence or that do not interact online on a regular basis. Such companies would have real difficulty in accessing the service. Part of the outreach of the Office of Government Procurement includes the "meet the buyer" events and the "go to tender" events to explain the portal, how it works, why it is of benefit and how to navigate it. I have just taken on this role and I am getting interesting feedback on how to make the system more accessible from people who have tried to access it. When I visited the Office of Government Procurement headquarters, it was one of the matters we discussed and it is something I hope to do in the context of some of the events I will be doing from the autumn on to get that to work better for companies. Deputy Burke is aware that a number of colleagues raised the issue previously as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">I agree with what was said by the other members who have raised the SME sector. What small and medium enterprises are being asked to do is against the principle of how they do business in that they protect their rates and the business that they have, and they are being asked to share their information with others to make up the critical mass to make the bid for whatever business might be going.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">Yes. If I was in this position, I would be conscious that this would involve divulging business data not only to the Department but to others, and then one is competing against larger companies with greater turnover. The turnover figure required to qualify to tender for business is too high. Not too many Irish companies have this level of turnover. The complaint is that many of the contracts for procurement end up going to companies outside the country. In France, they break down the system to ensure it is possible for the SME sector to engage directly in procurement. While the Government is making a saving in respect of a component of the business, it could be losing if small businesses lose their position in the marketplace with a loss of jobs. Some of those who lose out may be family-run businesses or individuals running a service for a Department or Government agency. It is difficult for them to compete or to get into the market. In some cases the State may be their only customer. We must find a way of engaging with the micro-businesses that are feeling the pinch in regard to the procurement process and cannot find a foothold in that process. They cannot fight it; they are up against the State. It is State processes versus the individual. There were interesting cases recently in respect of pest control services, education and stationery. The Department must examine the outcomes of procurement business to date versus the fallout for the SME sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">The Chairman has raised a very important point. We are undergoing a significant change in regard to how the State procures services. In a time when we were spending less money because of the crisis, what drove us all the time was the bottom line. That was the correct thing to do but, now that we have found some breathing room as a result of these practices, it cannot be just about the bottom line for the State. We must consider how small businesses work in different parts of the country. We have to think of social clauses in some of our procurement contracts. We also have to be mindful of the EU law under which we operate. Only about 7% of business goes outside the country. I know there is a perception in some parts of the country that a lot more contracts are being won by foreign companies, but that is not the case. When one looks at the statistics in terms of the business that Irish companies are winning abroad, we are doing better. We are doing better abroad by being able to access those markets, such as France and other markets in the EU. That is good for small businesses. I am meeting with Enterprise Ireland tomorrow to discuss this further.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">The information I was given about France is that the French break down the contracts in the interests of their own indigenous businesses. The EU should be challenged on the rules and regulations it imposes on member states. Sometimes it is not a case of one size fits all. If a measure is imposed on France, it will respond to it quickly.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">A criticism that has come back to me is that we are over-interpreting EU directives. I want to examine whether this is the case. A good recent EU directive is the 2014 directive on procurement, which is aimed at small and medium enterprises, so it opened the door for consortium bidding and also lotting. I have heard anecdotally that lotting is being taken up but consortium bidding is not, perhaps for the reasons the Chairman suggested. I hope to go to Kilkenny in September as I have been invited, as the Minister with responsibility for procurement, to meet small businesses to hear their concerns. I will keep the Chairman fully informed of that visit. We are trying to continuously improve what we are offering to Irish businesses, so I need to know the facts from the ground.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">It is good that the Minister gets beyond the statistics and gets down to the level of real people. That is where the effects are felt most. I think the experience has been negative, but perhaps with some tweaks here and there the system could allow Irish businesses to hold their own within the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">We want them to more than hold their own. As the Government spends more money as we decentralise procurement and find efficiencies, we want Irish businesses to do well. We have to be mindful of EU directives, but there is also a wider conservation that we have to have. We have a duty to the taxpayer to save and find value for money but we also have a duty to Irish businesses and people. It about finding a balance. We did a successful pilot project. Let me add that we have a duty to individuals in terms of our social clauses, including people who have been out of work too long and people who need education in work. The State can help by awarding contracts to Irish businesses in an open and transparent way while also saving money and getting value for money.</p>

Each time the question is asked, we are told the Department is consulting with the HSE or the HSE is consulting with the Department. Nobody has given a straight answer to date. As a result, there is a major single Department with a significant budget that is not able to provide the information that one would expect. The IT systems that are required should be put in place. They are not reinventing the wheel; such IT systems are used all over the world. Nobody can understand why it cannot be done.</p>

They deal with their colleagues in the other Departments on a daily basis. I will mention another initiative which it would be worthwhile for the committee to look at in the coming months. We have funded a new initiative as part of the open Government partnership called<i> benefacts.ie</i>. We have co-funded this with Atlantic Philanthropies. It is a single database in which every citizen will be able to see the funding stream that any charity organisation receives from the taxpayer. It is something I encountered when I was working with the Chairman on the Committee of Public Accounts. If one is dealing with an organisation in receipt of taxpayer funding, sometimes it receives multiple streams of funding and it can be very difficult to identify the total amount received. We have co-funded a website that now means any citizen can go in and find out what any charity organisation gets from the taxpayer and from whom they get it. We launched the initiative a number of weeks ago. I hope over the coming years it will play a really big part in enabling people to better understand where their money goes.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">Yes. If there is capital expenditure involved in the acquisition of buildings and those buildings are not being used, we would have discussions with the line Departments on that. At times, there can be valid reasons that has not happened and why a building has been used or has changed and is not being used in the way we want. We would be as concerned as the Chairman if taxpayers' money was spent on the delivery of a facility which was not being used in the way that was intended. The Chairman is right to say that most of that work would happen through the OPW. The OPW also has a Vote that is accountable to me and we will work with it on such matters.</p>

Where suggestions are made for the improvement of accountability as is often done in the Committee of Public Accounts for wards of court, is it the Minister's decision to respond, is it a policy decision that creates the response or is it just the response of the Accounting Officer?</p>

          <p eId="para_471">If it is an issue of accountability between my Department and another Department, the responsibility sits with me but in the operation of these things, if I want to change the reporting relationship between me and another Government Department I would have to seek the consent and agreement of the other Department to do so. I might gain its agreement but I have to have its commitment to make it work. On the accountability between an Accounting Officer and an organisation in receipt of funding from the line Department, the accountability relationship is between the Accounting Officer and the organisation but clearly any matters on taxpayers' money are of concern to my Department.</p>

We are already funding a free helpline and an advice line service which is provided by an independent law centre under the auspices of Transparency International Ireland.

          <p eId="para_481">Yes. This is a new allocation. It is a new funding line for 2016. I am satisfied with it and alongside that it is something I have to be ever vigilant on. My experience of these matters is that one cannot always assume the culture is in place. It is something that has to be worked on year after year. The moment one thinks that we have culturally gotten to the right place on these matters and that it requires no further attention, we are slipping backwards.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">There was an unexpected increase in the number of samples submitted to the coroner's office to date, which led to a backlog. There was also a delay in potential prosecution oil samples for the Revenue Commissioners, which were carried into 2016 from last year due to a large increase in sample numbers. As the State Laboratory has been operating with a staff deficit in the laboratory analyst grade since mid 2015, it will not be possible to clear these backlogs until the vacant positions are filled. We have now implemented a recruitment campaign, organised through the Public Appointments Service, and we hope to fill these positions in the next few months to deal with the timeliness of these services.</p>

The number of tests expected to be analysed for this year is 400,000, with 12,400 samples to be analysed. With regard to the analysis of samples, to date there have been 5,326 samples analysed, with 232,519 individual tests having taken place. It is a very high-frequency service.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">Deputy Sherlock referred to services to Members of the Houses. That entire area must be examined in great detail. Information technology was mentioned and we have an excellent service here. Sometimes one is better to stay with it. It is constantly evolving and it needs investment. Members are being asked much more now with regard to their work in the House and it is extremely difficult to meet all the demands for time. Certainly, technology allows us to bridge that gap.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">The Oireachtas has come on in leaps and bounds in helping Members communicate with the public through technology. It is now much easier, for example, to get a 30-second clip of this meeting or a speech in the Dáil and put it on Facebook or Twitter or however somebody wants to use it. As more of our work is going digital, it is creating obstacles in terms of security, data protection and access to data. We have this year appointed a new person as Government Chief Information Officer. The person in question came from Northern Ireland and did great work up there. I was in Belfast recently and heard all about it first hand. We are facing big challenges in the public service and the challenge will come to us as politicians as well. Decisions will have to be made on the way we want to go. The idea of having the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is to tie everything together, with one office or person leading or driving it. Very recently, the Government Chief Information Officer got the chief information officers from each Department together as part of building an action plan from the ICT services strategy deployed last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> We now need an action plan off the back of that for the next three or four years, perhaps up to 2020. It should deal with what we want to do, not just in terms of improving the service here for members as we interact and try to do our jobs but, more importantly, for the public and how they interact with government. We are now seeing a greater possibility and opportunity for the public to engage more not just with politicians but with government and to ensure those engagements are positive. Rather than going to get a driving licence and queuing for three hours, trying to get there on time or having all sorts of difficulties, as we move more government services online, we should make their interactions better and more efficient. We can then get greater buy-in from people because of that, which will help everybody. That is the kind of work they are trying to drive towards.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The chief information officers have had their first session and the follow-up will be in the next couple of weeks. From that, we will build an action plan and I would like to see that started in the autumn. It is very important when it comes to issues like sharing data with the public and making it intelligible for them. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, mentioned all the data and information we have already online as a Government relating to matters like budget, spending and related documentation. I am keen to make that intelligible and accessible for people. We have discussed tax transparency issues before as being suitable for being placed on a website, so people can see exactly and broken down by Department where their money is going in euro and cent. People can then have an informed debate with representatives on the priorities that the Government should focus on with public money.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">Please do not lose sight of the fact that these Houses need funding to put their Members ahead of the game. It is very important that we renew constantly the information and technology for Members. Inevitably, regardless of what is online, the Member would be on the front line. Members engage directly with constituents. It is important to remember in the entire process the Parliament and its Members. I know the Minister of State is not forgetting them but we must ensure they are given priority.</p>
