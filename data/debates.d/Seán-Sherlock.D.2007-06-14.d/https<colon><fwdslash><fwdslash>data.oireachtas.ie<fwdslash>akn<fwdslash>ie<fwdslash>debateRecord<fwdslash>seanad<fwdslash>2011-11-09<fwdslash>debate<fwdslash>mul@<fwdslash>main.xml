          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Social Protection to discuss the way self-employed PRSI contributions can be taken and yet entitle the payer to nothing when injured or ill, through no fault of his or her own.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the progress that has been made in designating Waterford Institute of Technology as a university and the importance of this for the south-east region.</p>

        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_7">While I was trying to be helpful yesterday, I might have been somewhat overzealous in what I said.  I am trying to be constructive regarding passing on the interest rate cut to mortgage holders on variable rates.  All Members of this House are concerned that the two State-funded banks, Bank of Ireland, which includes ICS Mortgages, and AIB, have yet to make any statement on the matter and more importantly have not passed on the 0.25 percentage point rate cut.  We will see a further rate cut perhaps by the end of the year or in January or February of the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">In order to ensure we do not have a Mexican stand-off between Government and banks every time there is an interest rate reduction, yesterday I asked for a special debate here to ascertain what the Government is doing to ensure the two banks that the taxpayer saved from going to the wall will pass on these rate cuts.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance come to the House to explain what the Government is doing to ensure that the banks and the lending institutions that hold banking licences — not just the two that are propped up by taxpayers' funds — pass on the interest rate reduction.  The Minister should outline what will happen in the future when we see further interest rate reductions.  The Taoiseach said last week that should the Financial Regulator not have the powers to insist upon the banks passing on the interest rate cuts, which he does not, he would seriously consider introducing legislation.  I wish to notify the House today that Fianna Fáil is preparing a Bill to provide those powers to the Financial Regulator, which legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas next week.  We are trying to assist the Government on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The amendment to the Order of Business asks that the Minister or Minister of State come into the House to discuss this issue and let us know what legislation the Government proposes to put in place.  I will withdraw that amendment to the Order of Business if the Leader gives a commitment this morning that sufficient time will be set aside next week to allow Members of the Seanad to discuss this serious issue which is affecting hundreds of thousands of people in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">I welcome the response yesterday from the Leader, the Deputy Leader and other Members on the Government side of the House that they would welcome a debate on the appointment to the European Court of Auditors.  Is that offer still on the table?  When will that debate take place?  I heard in the Dáil yesterday and again this morning Ministers of the Government say they stand over the nomination of Mr. Cardiff.  I do not wish to personalise matters but Mr. Cardiff will have to be interviewed by a panel of our European peers and it is, in my view, unlikely he will be sanctioned and given the post at the European Court of Auditors.  The Government has made big play of the fact that it is working hard to improve our reputation in Europe, if that requires to be done.  I accept that.  Let us take it that needed to be done.  What reputational damage will this do?</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The Leader and the Deputy Leader stated yesterday in the House that they would welcome a debate on this issue.  Will such debate take place tomorrow, when there is ample time available for it or will it take place today?  The Government will tomorrow publish the review of the capital programme, which will introduce €750 million worth of cuts.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate on that issue either tomorrow or early next week?</p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik</from>
          <p eId="para_12">Senator O'Brien again expressed, as do we all, condemnation of the failure of some banks to pass on the interest rate cut.  It should be stated — this was not alluded to by the Senator — that since yesterday another bank, the EBS, has announced it will pass on the interest rate cut, which we welcome.  It is hoped there will be further progress in that regard during the next 24 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">It is clear from the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on radio this morning that the Government is moving towards preparing legislation to address this issue if the banks do not fall behind the interest rate cut.  This is what needs to be done, if as the Senator says there is to be a Mexican stand-off every time.</p>

          <from>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_62">With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I would like again to raise with the Leader the Palestinian issue.  I am sure all Members received this morning communications in regard to the current position of the two civilian vessels and the manner in which they have been treated.  The Irish vessel was almost sunk as a result of water being pumped onto it by the Israelis.  I know that the families of the Irish people on board, who are all people of conscience, are particularly concerned about their fate.  They have been threatened with incarceration, ill-treated, roughed up and stripped naked and photographed.  This incident has been off the radar for the past couple of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">It is particularly important, given the position of the Government on a Palestinian state, which is what we favour, that those who wish to support the people of Gaza who are suffering are enabled to do so.  Gaza is one of the most populated places on earth with 1.5 million people on a small piece of territory.  These people are being denied their basic requirements, medical and otherwise.  Children, women and old people are suffering.  Ireland has always been to the forefront in the matter of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">It is no longer sufficient for us to say we favour an independent Palestinian state.  While our diplomats may be in touch with the situation, we must send out loud and clear the message that we do not want our citizens interfered with in this particular manner.  Likewise in respect of the Canadian vessel; one of the people on board that vessel is an American journalist who has been able to give a first-hand account of what occurred even though her equipment was confiscated to ensure she would not get out the real story which would be in conflict with the sanitised story put out by Israel.  I suggest to all who received the document that they read it closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">In spite of the other pressing issues with which we must deal we must look after our people in difficulty and ensure the state or nation responsible answer for their actions.  I suggest that the Seanad draft a resolution which ensures our immediate and urgent support for these people of conscience who are trying to help those whose human rights are not being upheld.  I ask that the Leader consider the framing of a motion to this effect during the next couple of hours.  This would ensure support for the people concerned when they need it most.</p>

          <from>Senator Jimmy Harte</from>
          <p eId="para_73">I refer to a local issue in Letterkenny.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House to discuss the ongoing problem in Donegal and in the Letterkenny area in particular where several developers have left the scene and gone into receivership.  There have been public meetings held regarding the issue of sewage pumps in housing estates.  The ESB has announced it will discontinue the power supply on 20 November because there is no one to pay the ESB bill.  I am informed that some of the developers are from Northern Ireland and one in particular has gone into receivership.  The receiver has been contacted without success.  Ultimately, the responsibility for the bill will fall back on the county council.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">There is much anxiety in the area and the situation is similar in other places in the county.  Letterkenny has three estates which are recently built and if a substantial ESB bill is not paid by 20 November, the power to the sewerage system will be cut off for these estates and it will become a public health issue.  I ask that the Minister come to the House to enlighten us on how this will be resolved.  It is impossible for residents who purchased these properties in good faith to foot this bill.  As Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú said, a nation must look after its people.  This is a local issue——</p>

          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_77">I join Senator Ó Murchú in again raising the issue of the 14 Irish citizens who are being detained in Israel.  I received the e-mail and I have also been in contact with the families of some of those people who are being held by Israel.  Two Sinn Féin councillors, Councillor John Hearne and Councillor Pat Fitzgerald, were on the boat and are now being held captive by Israel.  Others being held include a former Fianna Fáil Deputy, a former rugby international player and a SIPTU official.  These 14 Irish citizens are being treated disgracefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">It is interesting that the American journalist to whom Senator Ó Murchú referred, Jihan Hafez, talked about how the people were treated.  She talked about how they were roughed up, mistreated, stripped searched and filmed naked.  This is how the State of Israel and the Israeli authorities are treating Irish citizens and it is absolutely appalling.  Two water cannons were used to force some of those on board down onto the lower decks.  Four warships, three gunships and two naval ships were employed.  Dozens of commandos stormed the ship and they used force to remove citizens from that boat to bring them to Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">I have a question for the Leader because this is a very serious matter.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has described this venture as a legitimate humanitarian aid mission.  If this is the case, then the Department accepts that Irish citizens are being held against their will and are essentially being held captive.  It is appalling that Irish citizens, who are trying to help and assist the people of Gaza who have been subject to a blockade and are victims of a humanitarian crisis, should be blocked in their efforts by the Israeli State, taken from their ship against their will, treated in this manner and detained.  At a judicial hearing yesterday, the judge said he could hold those Irish citizens for up to two months.  This is outrageous and I ask that the Tánaiste makes every effort to ensure that all of those 14 Irish citizens are returned to Ireland as quickly as possible.  This reinforces the need for us to have a discussion about what is happening in Palestine because it is appalling.  A total of 42 civil society organisations operating in Gaza and Palestine sent out a call to the international community asking for people to do something about what is a humanitarian crisis in that part of the world.  These Irish citizens were responding to that call, trying to bring medicines to women and children and men who are suffering in that part of the world.  That is why it is important that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade comes to the House to have that discussion about the appalling humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Palestine.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">I am assuming that is a yellow card which has been issued to the Chief Whip.  I endorse all that has been said so far regarding the humanitarian crisis unfolding off the coast of Israel, off the coast of the putative state of Palestine.  In that context, it is important that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to the House.  The Leader may correct me but I do not believe he has yet come to the House to debate Ireland's foreign policy in general since he was nominated to that position.  I suggest the Leader might keep this in mind, especially now when, once again, Israel is flying in the face of international sentiment, as has been outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">It is not enough for the Israelis to say that humanitarian products can be transited through Israel. The state of Palestine is on the cusp of nationhood.  In that context, a little-known revelation last week, which was not widely reported, is that UNESCO decided to fund Palestine.  Such was the impact of this decision that the United States has withdrawn significant funding from that body which is the cultural organisation of the United Nations.  Israel has also withdrawn funding from UNESCO and announced in the same breath that it would proceed with further illegal settlements which are in contravention of several UN resolutions going back to 1967.  I question if Israel is really concerned about promoting peace and stability in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Those decisions, coupled with what is going on right now, as has been outlined — the humanitarian crisis and the degrading manner in which Irish citizens are being treated — hardly support the Israeli cause.  Why are the Israelis shooting themselves in the foot once again?  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade the strong sentiment of this House and to emphasise the support we are giving to the Irish citizens in question.  The Minister should call in the Israeli ambassador to the Republic of Ireland today to convey our anger about Israel's unacceptable policy towards Irish citizens.  He should look for an immediate response.</p>

I listened to the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Taoiseach and others saying they will deal with the banks if the interest rate cuts are not passed on.  It is appalling that these banks, of which we are the paymasters, should behave in such a despicable fashion.  We own them.  It is right that this issue has been well vented here.  I look forward to the introduction of legislation in this area.  I think it is inevitable that we will have to introduce legislation, even if the interest rate cuts are passed on.  This situation will repeat itself as interest rates are cut by the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">It is most appropriate to congratulate Ryanair on its spectacular results.  It is likely to make a profit of €440 million during these recessionary times.  Regardless of whether one likes Michael O'Leary, one has to admire him for that.  I admire him for another reason as well, which is that he pays his taxes in this country.  I would like to ask the Leader a question in that context.  I am aware of significantly wealthy individuals who have mansions in this country, but are tax exiles.  This situation needs to be dealt with comprehensively, for once and for all, in the upcoming budget.

Obviously, we cannot do anything retrospectively about payments that have already been made.  There are laws dealing with it.

Those involved know what happened the last time.  They knew what would happen this time.  We are now pleading for them to be released.  They knew this would happen.  What I really took from this mission was the message of the people on the ground in Gaza.  People on the pier had placards telling the EU and the UN they needed protection rather than aid.

          <p eId="para_125">I will come to the second issue about which I would like to ask the Leader.  The "cash for gold" industry has been mentioned in the House previously.  It needs to be the subject of regulation and legislation.  I would like to propose an addendum to that.  The "cash for scrap" industry also needs to be included when regulations are introduced.  A person might bring 20 copper tanks to a scrap merchants today, before arriving with four scrap cars the following week and numerous rolls of fibre optic cable the week after that.  Such a person might not have any identification.  Most of the material in question is stolen.  There should be a process of identifying such people.  This sector should be regulated.  The "cash for scrap" industry is the same as the "cash for gold" industry.  I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister the need for regulation and legislation to be introduced to stop this practice.</p>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, accompanied me on a trip to Palestine.  He knows what the situation is like on the ground.  He is well aware of what is happening on the ground.  He should take firmer action in the current circumstances.  He should call in the Israeli ambassador.  I will go further.  If the Israeli Government is not prepared to safeguard the well-being of Irish people, we should expel the Israeli ambassador.  We are closing our embassy in the Holy See, even though the Holy See never offended us in this way.</p>

It is a crucial issue and perhaps it was not understood yesterday.  I hope the Leader is not suffering from Dublin-centric thinking since becoming Leader.  It is clear to all in the west that the traffic situation in Galway is chaotic.  It is a national issue.  The reason I asked that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport take it on board was that many of the problems stem from agencies under his auspices co-operating with other agencies.  I refer to the National Roads Authority, Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the airports, Iarnród Éireann and the co-ordination of transport services in and out of the city, whether by rail, air, bus, car, or bicycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">This is a very serious issue.  We need to get Galway city moving in order that we can create more employment and allow people to get in and out of the city and not be turned off visiting the city, a matter to which a number of Senators refererred yesterday.  It takes two hours to get to Galway from Dublin on an outstanding new motorway but then one is stuck in traffic for one hour trying to get through the city.  It is a very serious issue and I ask that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport attends the House to debate it.</p>

If the VEC template is used, it will be a disaster.  Many of us became Members of this House through the councils and we are dependent on county councillors to keep us here.  It is a very democratic system.  I want to see the role of the councillor and our county councils protected.  Will the Leader arrange such a debate?</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I wish to join in the debate on the situation in Gaza.  I visited Gaza as a Member of the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee four weeks after Israel used extreme force, cluster munitions and white phosphorus and got away with it.  More than 1,400 people were killed.  I fully support the call for a debate on this matter.  However, it is important we put it into perspective.  Pressure on Israel must come from Europe and the United States because they are the big players.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I am aware of that but I would like to put it into perspective.  Israel is the fourth largest exporter of arms in the world, yet in a four year period, it imported $1.4 billion worth of arms and munitions.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">While the protest helps to highlight the issue, the real pressure should come from Europe and the US because they can force a change in policy.  There is a need for a change in policy in this area.  It is important we debate the matter and that we convey our concerns about the way this issue is being dealt with.  I was in Gaza two years ago but nothing has changed since then or in the past 25 to 30 years.  The question is whether a similar debate will be held again in 30 years time, not necessarily in this House but in Dáil Éireann.  It is time for pressure from Europe and the US.  That is why a debate would be helpful.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">On two consecutive days, there have been extensive calls for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to attend the House.  Yesterday, the main issue in that regard was the closure of the embassy in the Holy See and today, it is the situation in Gaza.  We have there two reasons the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should attend the House today.  It would be helpful if the Leader could express his commitment to asking him to attend the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Yesterday, the Leader expressed the hope that were economic circumstances to permit, the embassy to the Holy See would be reopened.  This is in danger of becoming a running sore among many of good will and some date on the door would be a good idea.  We have targets in overseas development aid which we will hopefully reach at a particular date.  It would be a mature signal from the Government if it indicated when the embassy may reopen.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Senator Noone and others raised the matter of alcohol abuse on yesterday's Order of Business.  Today, reports state cases of treatment for alcohol abuse are up by over 40% since 2005, another running sore.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Shortall, described below-cost selling of alcohol, as well as advertising targeting young people, as irresponsible.  Many of us will have heard the stirring interview by Seán O'Rourke with a man who lost his son as a result, partially, of alcohol abuse.  That man pointed the finger at below-cost selling of alcohol and house parties which allow young people to drink in an unrestricted environment.  This issue needs to be addressed in this House soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">With regard to whether we should be concerned about alcohol advertising targeted at young people, I believe it is past time we got rid of all alcohol advertising.  I have called for the banning of alcohol advertising at sports and cultural events.  We need to face up to this as a major issue in our society which has major consequences for public health now and will have in the future as the rising cost of treating people in later life as a result of alcohol abuse will become clear and stark.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on this matter soon?</p>

Whether we like it on either side of the House, 14 Irish citizens are in Givon prison in Israel, arrested and detained against their wills in an aggressive, determined and disgusting manner.  I also support the calls made regarding the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.  He does have a responsibility in this case.  He is in our jurisdiction and he should answer questions posed in the Dáil and Seanad.  If we cannot fulfil this onus of responsibility and have a debate on this matter, we are doing a disservice to the 14 Irish citizens being held against their will in Givon prison.  I hope the Leader will accede to requests for a debate on this issue either today or tomorrow with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I second Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment to the Order of Business.  While I accept the Leader has explained the Water Services (Amendment) Bill will be before the House next Wednesday, it is important adequate time is given to debate septic tank charges, a serious issue particularly to people in rural areas who, on the face of it will face a €50 registration fee, when in reality they will face bills of up to €12,000 to rectify problems with their septic tanks.  While I have no difficulty with such remedial works being carried out, they should be accompanied with a substantial grant for the works.  That, however, is not part of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I support Senator O'Sullivan's request for a debate on local government reform.  I have raised this too on several occasions in recent months.  It is important the Minister responsible outlines his plans for local government reform with particular emphasis on what he intends to do in reducing the number of county councillors and his plans for town councils.  Rumours are circulating he will abolish the town councils, a proposal I would strongly oppose.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I agree with Senator Mullen on the need to ban alcohol advertising.  Any approach by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, to increase the price of alcohol should be done on an all-Ireland basis.  Coming from a Border county, I am only too aware of droves of people from as far away as Cork and Kerry going to the North to purchase large quantities of alcohol.  Increasing drinks prices will have no effect but to damage the economy if it is not applied on an all-Ireland basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Senators Darragh O'Brien, Coghlan, Conway, Norris and several others raised the issue of interest rate cuts.  The Government agrees with the Financial Regulator who has stated he will not tolerate unfair increases being put on variable rate mortgage holders to make up for the banks' past mistakes.  Apart from the recent European Central Bank interest rate decrease, the Financial Regulator has said he will be assessing the matter carefully.  The Central Bank has also stated it will consider seeking additional legislative powers to force the limit on the interest rates charged by the banks.  The Taoiseach has already given an undertaking that he will consider this request and the Government will take quick action on the matter.  The Government wants all banks, not just the State-supported ones, to treat their customers fairly in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">My office is making inquiries to see if the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, will be available either today or tomorrow for a debate on appointments to the European Court of Auditors and the capital programme.  However, I cannot offer a guarantee in this regard.  Ministers have various commitments and I cannot say whether the Minister of State will be available next week.  Nevertheless, I will endeavour to facilitate a debate on the matter, subject to the availability of Ministers.  Everybody will agree that the Ministers in question have a very busy schedule and have treated this House with the utmost respect in attending debates at every opportunity.  I will ask them to accommodate us next week for a debate on this issue, but I cannot guarantee it will be possible.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
          <p eId="para_400">I thank Seanad Members for giving me the opportunity to address the House today on the issue of community affairs.  Community issues are central and recurring themes for those of us engaged in public life and public service.  We are dedicated to doing what is best for our communities, whether these communities are defined as people bound by geographical areas, by common sectoral interests or by thematic interests.  No matter how we describe it, it all comes down to community.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Senators today on my Department's role in community issues, the programmes and supports we provide and some ideas I am seeking to bring forward in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The deliberate marrying of responsibilities in a single Department — the community and the local government briefs — provides me with an excellent opportunity to deliver more sustainable and practical joined-up services at a local level than otherwise would have been the case.  I believe the role of local government is very important here and I will come back to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">One of my Department's key objectives is to improve the quality of life and welfare of our communities, with a particular focus on those communities that are vulnerable or disadvantaged.  We seek to address this objective through a range of supports that foster vibrant, sustainable and inclusive communities, and which also promote an active, democratic and pluralist society.  My Department will invest some €163 million on community and local development in 2011.  Of course, much of this is provided as matching funding, which means we leverage substantial additional sums for investment in our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The development of sustainable and vibrant communities is not just about providing funding; the funding provided must be invested wisely.  For this reason, we aim to have robust programmes that deliver meaningful outcomes for our communities.  We always seek to ensure that the impact of investment under these programmes can be assessed.  The Senators will understand that with socially focused programmes, this is not always easy to do.  However, if we are to ensure the ongoing sustainability of these programmes and continued investment, it is vital that we are able to demonstrate meaningful impacts for the citizen.  I am confident that we are in a position to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The local and community development programme is a key social inclusion intervention managed by my Department, which aims to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between the Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.  Some €63 million will be invested in our urban and rural communities through the programme this year.  Given the current economic crisis and the level of unemployment, the programme is more relevant than ever.  It works to increase access to formal and informal educational activities, increase people's work readiness and their employment prospects, and provide a solid foundation for employment creation.  The programme as it is now being implemented involves a new and improved approach.  It is underpinned by a more focused delivery with the aim of improving employment prospects, with more robust monitoring and evaluation in assessing the impacts for individuals and communities.  I am proud to say that international evidence suggests we are leading the way with regard to evaluating the impact of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The rural development programme, particularly the aspects that support the rural economy and community-focused actions, is another key intervention underpinning my Department's community development ethos.  This programme seeks to address the unique challenges facing our rural communities by promoting economic activity, stimulating job creation and improving access to basic services for rural dwellers.  Over the full programme period, €425 million will be invested in rural areas through its quality of life measures.  Some €62 million of this is earmarked for 2011.  Given the straitened times we face, the scale of this investment cannot be overestimated.  I believe the support provided through the programme will play a vital role in sustaining and developing dynamic rural communities in the years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Notwithstanding the undoubted impact of these and other programmes over the years, there is room for us to do more and do better.  We are facing increasing demands from our citizens for higher quality, more cost-effective and more efficient services against a backdrop of reducing resources.  We are also facing demands for greater citizen and community participation in the decision-making process.  While resources will continue to be stretched in the coming years, the demand for services is likely to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Accordingly, I have started to examine ways in which we can improve the quality and delivery of services to our communities.  I am seeking to maintain the provision of high quality front line services within available resources.  I want to examine how we can deliver more integrated and joined-up services in a way that responds more effectively to the needs of our communities, and to determine how to develop our communities in a way that involves the communities themselves in the decision-making process, fosters change and provides people with the means to shape their own futures.  The best way to achieve this is through a greater alignment of local and community development functions with local government functions.  To assist me in this, I have recently established a high-level alignment steering group to consider options for streamlining the delivery of services for our communities.  The steering group has a broad remit: it will review the roles of local development and local government, identify the scope for greater synergies between the sectors, and draft a roadmap for delivering simplified, cost-effective and efficient services for the citizen in a way that allows for local oversight and democratic accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I do not intend to pre-empt the deliberations of the steering group, but for us to deliver on the three key aims I mentioned — improved services, greater efficiency and effectiveness,and an appropriate role for local government — a more democratically accountable and responsible system of local governance is required.  It is of key importance that we develop a system that provides an enhanced role for local government in the management and delivery of local and community development functions.  To date, local government has been satisfied with a limited role in the provision of services to our communities, focusing primarily on the delivery of housing, water, planning, fire and environmental services, to mention a few.  As important as these services are, I am convinced the time has come for local government to take a more proactive role with regard to the social inclusion and quality-of-life aspects of its responsibilities.  There is significant scope for local government to broaden its attentions beyond what has been perceived as its traditional sphere of responsibility.  Accordingly, I expect to see local government take a more holistic approach to the provision of services for the citizen, take a greater lead in the administration and delivery of community and local development interventions at a local level, and take greater responsibility for local planning and decisionmaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Let us not be mistaken about this: there is much work to be done if local government is to develop the capacity it will need to deliver on these expectations.  In the past two decades, the gap in service provision at local level has been filled successfully by local development companies, albeit with significant public funding.  These companies have a proven track record when it comes to delivering services for their communities.  They have been the means through which valuable supports have been delivered to the hardest to reach in our communities.  By working closely with the communities they serve, they have developed vital expertise and a unique perspective that local government can learn from.  We cannot afford to lose this.  It is essential, therefore, that we harness the strengths and experiences of both the local government and the local development sectors and ensure that the best elements of both are retained in any revised local governance arrangements.  I am confident that local government can work in partnership with local development structures to deliver efficient, sustainable, joined-up and easy to access services.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Looking forward, our delivery systems need to be efficient and cost-effective and make the best use of available resources.  As I stated earlier, a greater role for local government can be the key to achieving this.  It is inherently inefficient and ineffective to have local governance arrangements that perpetuate the funding of multiple local development agencies from a significant number of Departments and State agencies for similar, complementary or overlapping objectives.  There are questions about the impact on efficiency of these delivery agencies, the ability to effectively measure the impact of resources invested and the administrative cost to the State of sustaining these arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Notwithstanding the achievements of the cohesion process, which has resulted in a significant rationalisation of local development structures, the sheer scale and complexity of the current structures is still daunting.  My aim is to unravel this complexity in order to develop local governance structures that are easy for the citizen to navigate and remove barriers to businesses, allowing economic activity to grow and our communities to prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I am conscious of the importance of the community and voluntary sector to the development of our communities.  The economic difficulties facing the country have undoubtedly had a considerable impact on both public funding and private investment from business and individuals to the not-for-profit sector, at a time when the need for services from the sector has increased.  Parts of the sector are hugely reliant on State funding, with not-for-profit organisations receiving an average of 60% of their funding from the public purse.  Clearly, this is very challenging in the current environment.  We have a shared responsibility to support the non-profit sector.  However, both philanthropy and fund-raising capacity are underdeveloped in this country, and we lag behind other nations such as the US and the UK in terms of a strategic approach to private investment in the non-profit sector.  In particular, there is great scope to increase corporate giving in this country.  This is why I reconvened the forum on philanthropy and fund-raising last June.  I asked the forum to introduce proposals for a strategy to develop philanthropy and fund-raising in support of civil society, and I anticipate that these proposals will be delivered by the end of this month.  There is an urgent need for such a strategy, but also a major opportunity to create new and innovative public-private partnerships to address fundamental social and economic challenges and, in addition, to help support arts and cultural initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">We are fortunate in this country to have a vibrant and diverse community and voluntary sector, with more than 14,000 charities and not-for-profit organisations which contribute to Irish society in myriad ways by providing essential services in areas such as social care, child care, care of the elderly, health services, education, the environment, sport and culture.  While we are all aware of the value that these organisations bring to our quality of life, perhaps we do not fully recognise the value of the not-for-profit sector in the economic well-being of our country.  The wider not-for-profit sector in Ireland employs more than 100,000 people, which is equivalent to the numbers employed in agriculture.  It is estimated that the sector has an annual turnover of €5.7 billion and generates €3.7 billion in wages and salaries per annum.  Moreover, funding channelled into the sector goes straight to work in every city, town and parish across the country, boosting local employment and the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">These figures do not include the tens of thousands of unpaid volunteers who make an enormous difference on a daily basis in every parish in the country, from serving on school boards to coaching football teams.  For example, the Tidy Towns awards ceremony earlier this year paid tribute to what has become one of the most important environmental initiatives in this country, all driven by an army of volunteers working in 821 cities, towns and villages across the country in co-operation with local authorities as well as local business and tourism efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">As many Senators are aware, 2011 has been designated the European year of volunteering, and it is appropriate that we pay tribute in this House to the countless active citizens within our communities.  These volunteers provide care and support services across the community in large and well established organisations and in small, informal groupings.  They measure their success not by making a profit but by making a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I reaffirm my commitment to supporting our rural and urban communities and the people within those communities.  My belief in the resilience of our local communities in the current, difficult economic time has been confirmed and enhanced since I became a Minister.  I am committed to securing the resources to ensure our communities will be in the best position to meet the challenges presented with the ingenuity and resourcefulness within them.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The current economic situation will continue to present challenges to our communities but with these challenges will come opportunities to pursue social and community development in a more co-operative, creative, innovative and co-ordinated way throughout the country.  By giving our communities the opportunity to have a greater say in decision making at a local level, they will emerge stronger and more sustainable as we continue on the road to economic recovery.</p>

          <from>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_426">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister.  I was particularly impressed with the presentation by the Minister today.  He has provided a four page document but I believe he has touched on many of the relevant issues for us to consider today and to be considered in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I acknowledge the work done at community level through the local councils, development bodies and the voluntary sector generally.  It is generally accepted that we are particularly lucky in Ireland that the community sector has remained strong, vibrant and focused throughout the years.  Often the sector is at its best when it is challenged.  We are especially challenged at the moment and we have been challenged in the past.  The challenges are not always about economic issues; other challenges arise for every community.  Everyone in the Chamber and all Members have direct experience of how a community responded urgently when the situation required it, whether it was someone suffering as a result of a local issue, and the manner in which the community came to the aid of that person is something that has inspired all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I am disappointed that Sinn Féin will not have eight minutes.  It is important at such a time as this to get all the contributions we can.</p>

          <from>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_430">This is why we are in the House.  Perhaps this can be examined at a future date because it is difficult to discuss the community and voluntary sector if some grouping in the House does not have the opportunity to put forward its views.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Minister has stated clearly that he is focused on decision making and ensuring that the local community will, hopefully, have an enhanced role when it comes to this issue.  There have been many changes in the past as part of which we have endeavoured to bring the local community into greater cohesion with the statutory bodies.  The experience most of us have had in this regard is that where there is a partnership between the community and the local authority and where money is spent, there is a better return rather than when the local authority alone is charged with spending the money.  This is the case for several reasons.  First, local community organisations have a track record and a focus.  They have particular aims and objects.  They are at the coalface and they are in touch with the community all the time.  Often they are able to bring on board a large degree of voluntarism.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">In no way does it surprises me that 2011 has been designated as the year of volunteering.  I drew up a paper on this issue and presented it to the Department because I believe it is important to examine precisely what we mean by voluntarism.  The experience many of us have had is that people who are given the opportunity and the structures to come forward with their own talents, time, services and so on are perfectly prepared to do so.  Multifaceted organisations and large numbers of other organisations are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Previously, I have remarked that in my home town of Cashel there is a population of 3,000 people but there are 37 community organisations operating.  These organisations cover a wide spectrum of activity, including sports, culture and art.  However, there are also bodies providing meals on wheels and others that provide a particular service for the people.  I have always believed that if one removed these organisations from the town — it holds true for everywhere else — we would have an impoverished town indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I recall years ago when county managers tended to stay somewhat aloof from the local community.  In many ways this strangled the possibility and the potential.  However, in the past quarter of a century or more I have seen cases where county managers have opened their doors and engaged with local organisations.  Often this has taken place in cases not involving monetary issues but they have been able to provide advice or direct an organisation in a certain way.  Therefore, the organisation finds that it has become part of an inclusive operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">There is a debate and discussion on whether town councils should continue.  I have a view on the matter.  I realise there are many arguments for saying it is not necessary.  However, at times we all believe that decentralisation often delivers the best results.  Local councils are in touch with the people.  I recall sitting on Cashel Town Council for many years.  After the annual estimates meeting, one would go outside the door having struck a rate and there were people waiting outside to meet those involved and to discuss issues immediately.  One had to defend what one did or explain something.  If one removed town councils there would be a vacuum.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">We all speak from our own experience but we see the town of Cashel as an ancient city and we refer to it as the city of the kings.  There is a great ceremonial role for councils in this regard.  If one takes away the town council, one takes away the potential for these ceremonial roles whether historical or cultural.  I call on the Minister to consult as widely as possible in his deliberations on the matter because no two councils are the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">In the past in Tipperary there have been two county councils, as my good friend, Senator Denis Landy, is aware, namely, North Tipperary and South Tipperary County Councils.  These are to amalgamate but there is also a suggestion abroad that we might go further and link two or three councils together.  I caution against such a move because we see county loyalty in question in Croke Park and everywhere and it is remarkably strong and an asset in itself.  The Minister touched on this in his presentation.  It would be a great pity if we did not continue to acknowledge loyalty to a particular county because we need it now more than ever.  I believe the Minister will give a good deal of consideration to this when we are discussing any future amalgamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I have left the question of funding late in what I have had to say because I do not believe it is the primary issue.  The more we can hold discussions with all partners at local level when funding is available, the better.  In this context we may be able to ensure that a particular body can do exceptionally good work with the help of a bedrock of volunteerism and great expertise that is not amateurish in any way and much of which is professional.  In the case of a recession such as this one such a body might suffer and people may not be aware of the suffering imposed on such an organisation.  I hope there can be a local focus whereby we could ensure this would not happen and that the organisations that have been delivering something will be a help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Minister made a good point with regard to fund-raising and methodology.  I offer one small suggestion for the Minister to consider.  If one has a few euro to spare and one put it in the bank one would be lucky to get 0.5% for it.  I suggest legislation should be introduced to allow organisations to get loans from outside bodies at a given time, at whatever percentage, such that the person given the loan would not have to pay DIRT.   This would mean that at the whim of banks money in deposits, which is dormant to a large degree, would be delivered up to the investor and released back out to the various organisations, the advantage being that they might get it at the rate of 1% or 1.5%.  We have operated this system in an organisation and I have seen it working.  I am absolutely amazed at the amount of money that is available.  If legislated for, it would give the organisations an opportunity of tapping into that money which is lying in banks.  I do not think any of us is particularly worried if the banks lose that bit of money and it comes back out into the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">There are many foundations not just in Ireland but in America, all of which have their own particular focus.  People have a case for tapping into those foundations but they do not have the expertise to do it.  It would be wonderful if local authorities and the Department would assist people to identify the foundations and the theme of the foundations and provide back-up assistance to enable people tap in.  I saw a case recently with a local organisation but I will not mention the foundation.  One cannot apply to the foundations, they must make the approach.  In this case, a particular organisation was advised to apply on the basis that it would get about €10,000.  A person from the foundation happened to attend a particular event and was pleased with what he or she saw and advised the organisation to make an application for €30,000.  These are only examples but they are much more prolific than one might think.  We need the backup and the professional assistance.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">Some of the officers in local authorities should be updated on issues in the same way as officers in the past did specific work because they could help in identifying bodies that might have a problem throughout the recession.  They might also find where there is a place for interaction and co-operation.  Even if one is an existing officer, one's role should be extended through consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I wish the Minister well.  I am impressed with his presentation because he has done precisely what we need.  If I had got a 20 or 30 page presentation today I would have said it was for the shelf.  He has touched all the right buttons and we should co-operate with him.  Perhaps he will return to the House when we have had an opportunity of testing the waters on some of the issues he has put forward.  He said something that is very important, namely, it is not just the quality of life which organisations of a voluntary nature give to a community, they also generate money.  Perhaps I can beat the drum in my final bid and express an interest.  For example, Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann held in Cavan in August generated €40 million for the region.  One can work out how much VAT was paid on that amount.  Many other organisations do likewise.  All the festivals throughout the country generate money for the Exchequer.</p>

          <from>Senator Cáit Keane</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I welcome the Minister on this important debate on the community and voluntary sector.  As we are aware the community and voluntary sector is the backbone of most of our community, and where would we be without it?  I am sure it was music to the Minister's ears to hear the praise he got from Senator Ó Murchú when he said the Government is pressing all the right buttons.  I could sit down and not say any more and just note it.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">In Ireland we have a long history of voluntarism, much of which has gone unrecorded.  The other phrase of meithil refers to the practice of neighbours coming together to face a common challenge, such as the harvest and, in doing so, achieve a common purpose.  The creation of mutual bonds of kinship binds communities together and this process has carried on throughout generations.  For mental health reasons and so on we save much by the community working together.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Historically volunteering has been an inherent part of the way in which communities in Ireland functioned and sustained themselves and, as such, did not garner much academic or policy attention until recent decades.  While the history of volunteering might be lacking rigorous or in-depth scholarly work, the area was given attention in the national committee on volunteering report in 2002.  Different phases in the development of volunteerism in Ireland were noted in that report as drawing on the Christian concept of caritas in medieval times and the strong tradition of Protestant philanthropy in the 18th century.  I will speak a little more about philanthropy which the Minister mentioned in his statement.  I welcome his proposals on the forum on philanthropy.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The report identifies the Gaelic revival in sport, culture and language as having very strong historical roots in voluntary work.  It also mentions the health benefits that people derive from giving — it is not only in receiving that people benefit but people derive health benefits from giving.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Traditional definitions of voluntarism suggest that volunteering is comprised of activities that are unpaid and entered into without compulsion.  In Ireland, however, volunteering can include a notion of membership, for example, membership of organisations such as the GAA.  The concept of member and volunteer can be one and the same.  The two greatest organisations, one of which was mentioned by Senator Ó Murchú, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the GAA are built on the selfless efforts of volunteers, both of which have economic benefits.  The volunteers travel up and down the country with their clubs.  The benefit to the community is in the doing and in the participation.  It is important not to forget the many people who give of their time to the community through the Tidy Towns competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The nature of volunteering may have changed over the decades but the needs of the individual and community for self-expression will continue and it is one of the significant aspects of volunteering, as is participation in community.  They play a valuable role in society.  The voluntary sector involves an incredible diversity of activity ranging from the informal to the highly structured, from the small <i>ad hoc</i> group to the well established larger organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The Minister has mentioned the changes he will make in the community and voluntary sector.  Those changes are welcome.  While it would be inappropriate for Government to seek full involvement across the voluntary activity or to control it, it is clear that it can continue to provide an enabling framework for this activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The great strength of voluntary activities emerges organically from our local communities.  The Minister mentioned the proposals made in October by the European Commission outlining frameworks for the delivery of EU funds post the 2013 period which places community-led local development at the centre of the future development of the European Union.  This announcement is welcome.  The new EAFRD regulation which forms part of the Common Agricultural Policy announced in Brussels last week also reinforces the centrality of community-led local development.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The commitment of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, to reducing duplication of services providing more efficient and effective local services and ensuring greater democratic accountability in decision making at local level, through the alignment of local government and local development sectors, is commendable.  I note the Minister used the word "alignment" and not "amalgamation".  There is much alignment and some amalgamation has to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The reconstitution of the Department was a deliberate strategic decision to bring together the three key actors working in all our communities under one Department.  Every year two thirds of Irish adults, more than 2 million people, engage in social, cultural and humanitarian exercises through a voluntary organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The community sector is estimated to be worth €5.7 billion to the economy and provides more than 63,000 full-time and part-time jobs, and pays €3.7 billion in wages.  That is not to be sniffed at.  Where would we be without the community and voluntary sector and its tireless work throughout the State?</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Minister indicated that he is aiming for a closer alignment of local government and local development, with the objective of reducing duplication of services, ensuring greater democratic accountability and decision making at local level and delivering more efficient and effective services for citizens.  He mentioned his commitment to the rural social scheme, with €425 million being allocated for quality of life services, of which €62 million is earmarked for this year.  I understand this is an increase of some millions of euro.  I welcome this announcement and the streamlining of the different organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">On public expenditure, the cutbacks in various areas are regrettable.  However, many of these cutbacks have been for the purpose of eliminating duplication.  The previous Government introduced a reduction of 8% in the community infrastructure programme in 2009.  In 2010 the Department's budget was reduced by a further 10%, leading to an overall cut of 18% and 20% in funding for community organisations.  This Government, unfortunately, has also had to make reductions, although, as I said, this was in many cases for the purposes of streamlining.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Will the Minister indicate how plans for the setting up of an all-Ireland consultative civic forum, in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, are progressing?  On a previous occasion in this House I asked the Minister to consider establishing a forum at local authority level.  We have the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member, and we are hopeful that the all-Ireland consultative civic forum will soon be established, but the <i>ad hoc</i> group that was in place at local level is no more.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Have the provisions of the Charities Act 2009 been enacted regarding regulation of charities and the establishment of a charities regulation authority?  We are all in favour of good governance and effective regulation not only in business, but also in respect of the community and voluntary sector.  The Minister alluded to that in his statement.  Although many board members of voluntary organisations are to be commended on their talents, the 2006 Dóchas report into governance in the community and voluntary sector found that many individuals were unsure of their roles and responsibilities and there was a prevalence of individuals sitting on boards who were not perhaps suited to their particular role.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">On the connection between politics and volunteering, many of us are here in this House because of our involvement in volunteer work.  I was so concerned about the divide between politics and volunteering that I took off myself off to Maynooth to study community development and volunteering.  There are many people on town councils who are volunteers and are not there for the money.  They devote great time to these matters and we should not forget them in today's debate.  Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú referred to that.  In seeking to avoid duplication in the provision of water, roads and planning, we should also recognise the input of town councillors and local volunteers.  There are ways to accommodate their input; it is not a question of having to have a water authority in every town.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the measures referred to by the Minister in regard to philanthropy.  There is great scope for development in that area.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">Before I begin, I take this opportunity to express my disappointment that the rules currently limit Sinn Féin's contribution to one minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am impressed with and appreciate his comments.  He is a man of action and implementation, and I look forward to what comes from his leadership in this arena.  I also welcome the debate as an integral part of the ongoing work of his and other Departments in developing strategies for and with the community and voluntary sector.  It is a time of exceptional challenge and opportunity for the work of Ireland's charitable and voluntary groups.  The Minister indicated that there are 14,000 such organisations in the country.  The figure I had was 7,900, but I will go with the Minister's figure; it all depends on how one cuts it.  Suffice to say we are talking about a huge number of organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">It is also a time of challenge for the sector's representative groupings such as the Irish National Community and Voluntary Forum and the Wheel, and for the Government's agenda of local government reform.  I thank the Minister for his leadership in this regard.  He referred in his speech to bringing together community and local government; that was a creative stroke.  I say this in light of my own lengthy experience of working in the community and voluntary sector in south Dublin county, particularly with the communities of west Tallaght, as well as in colleagueship with other community actors and counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">From the community and local development side, I have experienced the extraordinary resilience, innovation, flexibility and effectiveness of ordinary citizens gathering together to respond to local needs and ambitions.  These citizens, working together, have met the needs which State agencies were unable to meet, especially in communities experiencing severe disadvantage and intergenerational poverty.  From the local government side, I have witnessed the progressive efforts of elected representatives and executive administrations in developing programmes to provide more effective public services for citizens and residents which go beyond the traditional services delivered by local authorities.  I have experience of working in partnership with community agencies, local development agencies, local authorities and philanthropic organisations in developing innovative services and programmes.  I am sure the Minister will take such innovations into account as he develops the plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The challenge is to devise a new framework that will enable community and local government actors to develop and implement a common agenda as one community, pushing through the territorialities and drawing on the assets and strengths of each.  It is vital at this juncture that there is a mutual meeting of minds between participative democracy — which is where I would locate the community and voluntary sector — and representative democracy, where local government is located, in order to design, decide on, resource and implement the delivery of high-quality, effective and efficient public services.  This new framework should contain vibrant public spaces for advocacy and influence on laws and national policies.  Surely this is part of the contribution that local democracy in both its forms has to offer national sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I have several questions which I hope will assist the Minister in meeting this challenge.  First, how is his Department engaging with the community and voluntary sector in order to engage its learnings in the design, delivery and evaluation of high-quality services which meet the needs of citizens and residents?  Does he plan to engage directly with the sector, perhaps through a national dialogue, on how to structure and govern effective programmes and services, build programme design and service content on robust theories of change, and ensure collaboration between local government and community agents in determining how these programmes should operate and how outcomes should be achieved by means of a negotiated process?</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Second, the Minister has spoken of the need for greater alignment between local government and local development sectors in the context of the Government's reform agenda.  Does he view the community and voluntary sector as part of the local development sector or situated alongside it?  The latter is my view.  It is critical to retain the independence of the community and voluntary sector as well as its interdependence with local development and local government.  I ask the Department to consider a recent publication from the Wheel on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Third, what is the scope of the Minister's vision for partnership — I prefer the word"partnership" to "alignment" — between local government and local and community development?  Given that, as the Minister is aware, local government is extremely complicated territory, does it encompass the Government's genuine desire to devolve resources as well as responsibility from central to local democratic structures?  Does the Minister's vision incorporate a key role for community development approaches to reducing poverty, social exclusion and inequality?  I use the term "community development approaches" in a technical sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">As the Minister has indicated, his Department is responsible for the forum on philanthropy and fund raising, and he will be receiving an interim report shortly.  Will he be in a position then to recommend to the Government practical ways to increase charitable, philanthropic and planned giving to support the diversification of the funding base of the not-for-profit sector?  Does the Government have any plans regarding the Irish Nonprofits Knowledge Exchange, an online register of all Irish charities and a critical building block for effective regulation of the sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Organisations within the community and voluntary sector receive supports and funding from a range of Departments.  Do the Minister's plans incorporate an ambition to drive a joined-up and cross-departmental strategy and implementation plan to foster vibrant, sustainable and inclusive communities?</p>

          <p eId="para_479">I wholeheartedly agree with what Senator Zappone said and will not duplicate it.  I cite the exemplar, which I believe goes across the board, of the scheme to support national organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  We all appreciate that we are in a time of cuts.  However, to try to meet the shortfall created by those cuts, organisations are approaching many Departments or statutory agencies such as the HSE.  This year far more organisations received grants from this scheme, which disproportionately affected those national organisations for which this is the sole or core funding they receive from the State.  That needs to be reviewed within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and also in the wider scheme of funding community and voluntary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">In the Dáil on 16 June the Minister highlighted the need to eliminate duplication, with which I agree.  However, we also need to be careful about the gaping holes being created by the funding crisis as we force organisations to move from place to place looking to fill that vacuum of a non-consistent funding policy.  We have an opportunity to put in the building blocks consistent with the vision we want for the country in the years ahead.  A few years ago the previous Government in a very courageous move dropped the €1,000 early child-care supplement and introduced the free pre-school year.  It considered impact and outcomes for children.  It was universal with no top-up facility and has a 98% uptake rate.  It saves money for the State and has improved outcomes for children.  Those are the types of initiatives we should consider for this sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisLandy" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Senator Denis Landy</from>
          <p eId="para_481">I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the debate which represents the start to a wider debate.  I agree with much of what Senator Zappone said.  I approach these matters from the point of view of the citizen and not from the point of view of a sector or group.  Having been involved in local government for 25 years and having also worked in the voluntary sector in a family resource centre for a number of years, I can see things from both sides of the fence.  It should not be about them versus us but about both groups working in partnership.  At the end of this, democratic accountability should be the most important issue.  We need to realign and change the present system while maintaining democratic accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The community and voluntary sector covers a wide range.  Others have already mentioned that this is the year of volunteering.  Local development includes development companies, partnerships and enterprise boards.  Community development includes RAPID programmes, community development projects and family resource centres.  All these groups work together but sometimes there is a misconception that these are all voluntary organisations.  However, as the Minister correctly said, they represent an economic driver and provide almost €6 billion into the economy on an annual basis with wages of almost €4 billion.  While this may sometimes be lost it was illuminated during the general election campaign when the figures came out.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The work of local and community development groups in tackling poverty and making people more ready to take up employment and to provide foundations for employment opportunities is extremely important.  The realignment of local government and local development companies is the core.  The Minister used the word "realignment" and others used the word "partnership" — one can use any word one likes.  In recent years local development companies in whatever guise have overtaken local government.  The role of local government has been greatly reduced.  The Minister spoke about broadening the remit of local government into the areas of social inclusion and quality of life issues.  I have consistently said that local government should be involved in education, not just in VECs but across the entire sphere of education.  It should be involved to a greater extent in policing and not just sitting on joint policing committees but also having a real involvement in policing as well as in health and economic activity in the local area.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I seek information on the terms of reference of the steering group the Minister established.  It is essential that the players in community and local government be represented in that group.  If the people who are at the coalface are not participating, the outcome will be very poor.  There has been mention of the local authority system being involved in the realignment.  I hope the Minister is referring to town councils and county councils.  The town council is the core of any small town and is the centre of all activity within that town from a democratic perspective.  A number of years ago when I was mayor of my local town two development groups from the area attended a meeting on a local issue.  Both groups were in a position to offer up to €100,000 to help with the problem the community had, but I, as mayor of the town, did not have the facility to offer €1.  We have been overtaken in terms of the money being disbursed in our community, which needs to be brought back into the centre.  I want democratic accountability and I want the voluntary, community and the local democratic system to work together.  Ultimately, the democratic process and democratic accountability must be at the start and finish.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Minister spoke about expanding the remit of local government.  Would he consider establishing a scheme similar to the CE scheme within the local authority system to provide services for elderly people who live in local authority houses for the general maintenance and upkeep of their houses?  Owing to the recruitment embargo local authorities do not have the staff to do this.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue of the struggling last shop, pub and filling station in small villages.  If they close, the village as an entity and as a community will die.  The Minister can have a role in that matter if he makes an intervention.  I look forward to his responses to the questions posed and I look forward to the debate continuing.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I appreciate all he has said and is doing, in particular in regard to the forum on philanthropy and fund-raising referred to by Senator Zappone.  In regard to the philanthropy problem, it appears to me that the reason we do not have a high target is the use by wealthy people of tax breaks to avoid paying tax.  The introduction of tax breaks has affected philanthropy, which I am sure was not the intention.  This means a person wishing to give away money rather than pay tax on it cannot do so.  It is hoped that issue will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">There are many great things happening in this country in respect of which the State could act as a catalyst.  I wish to bring to the attention of the House the first of a six part programme, in which I am involved, about Drogheda commencing tonight on television entitled, "Local Heroes — A Town Fights Back".  It will be fascinating to watch.  The programme is produced by RTE, which believes that as a public service broadcaster it should be encouraging community and voluntary effort.  One such effort is the investment by the people of Drogheda in a time bank.  A time bank is the giving freely by a local solicitor, plumber, electrician and so on of one, two or three hours of his or her time to help the community.  It is a great example of what could happen with the assistance of various services throughout the country.  This is the type of activity in which the State can act as a catalyst.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The issue of whether people should have to work following a particular length of time on social welfare has been raised.  Many people say they would prefer to be doing something to help their community rather than at home doing nothing.  In Holland, following receipt of social welfare for 12 months, a person is required by Government to take up a job, say, painting a local school or cleaning the floors of a local hospital in exchange for social welfare payments.  As I said earlier, many people would prefer to do this rather than be at home doing nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">During a discussion I had with an RTE journalist in regard to an article on community employment schemes in Ireland, he told me how well they are working and that they could, if they had more managers to supervise them, employ hundreds of people.  Surely, there are out of work many highly qualified people who could be encouraged by way of extra funding to manage community employment schemes.  The journalist told me he saw firsthand the lift given to people working in their communities cleaning graffiti off walls, repairing homes and so on.  These are people who would otherwise have been unemployed.  In this regard, the journalist spoke to half a dozen from Darndale and Coolock.  It is pity there are not more similar projects operating in the country.  The manager of the Coolock centre said they need funding for more managers of work teams and that they could take hundreds of people off the dole with a little more funding.  I am not seeking funding in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The international baccalaureate requires students to set themselves eight targets of community work, in respect of which they are awarded extra points in their examination.  Perhaps a similar incentive could be included in our education system.  As I understand it, sixth year students in Britain who undertake such work are given marks towards their final examinations.  I believe we could do likewise.  There is much willingness in Ireland to do voluntary work but a little spark is needed.  I do not believe that spark is a money spark, rather it is the type of spark being undertaken by RTE in this area.  Other State bodies could encourage people to do likewise.  All people need is encouragement.  The Minister referred earlier to the amount of good work being done and the level of enthusiasm and energy in community and voluntary work.  The Minister's heart, in terms of the words he used today, is in the right place.  Let us ensure it happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">The Minister should encourage the culture and philosophy of the charitable sector within his Department, which would have the same aims of most charities.  Before making some general points, I would like to make one specific point.  It is probably not widely known that virtually all the clinical medical research which takes place in this country is undertaken voluntarily.  Almost no doctors are paid as part of their contract to do medical research.  Most of those who do research, do so on an entirely voluntary basis and during family rather than practise time.  This can have huge benefits, namely, medical research makes treatment better, patients on medical research programmes tend to get better treatment than do patients getting equivalent treatments off-programme because of the added discipline and rigour of taking part in a research study.  Also, it has the potential to bring in huge amounts of investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I have run several medical research focused charities over the years.  Without going into all the details, I believe, on the back of an envelope calculation, that they have generated approximately 200 jobs and have brought millions of euro into the country.  More important, they have resulted in the availability for our people of millions of euro worth of drugs that would otherwise not have been available.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">While the Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for ensuring everything is done by the book, it is important the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government attempts to grease the wheels to ensure there is a facilitation of the research process.  There are many people who will donate money to charities, charities which have many beneficial social aims.  These people may be happier to donate to a charity than to the Government which may use it to pay off bondholders, public relations contracts or other functions which they would believe to be less socially rewarding.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The issue of charities being forced to pay VAT on their purchases needs to be addressed.  It is wholly illogical that companies can in respect of commercial purposes write off expenses while charities cannot.  I strongly encourage the notion of work fare, as outlined by Senator Quinn to whom I am grateful for sharing his time with me.  People are, through no fault of their own for the most part, unemployed.  There are many unemployed people in receipt of a degree of benefit who would like to contribute to society.  The charities with which I am involved have calculated that with ten, 20 or 30 hours of voluntary work their costs could be overcome.  I ask that the Minister keep an eye on the charities ball.</p>

          <from>Senator Colm Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_503">My involvement in the voluntary sector is based on my legal background and my chairmanship of a community association which employed more than 30 people under a community employment scheme, which worked effectively.  Many of the people involved in that scheme had gotten into the rut of being unemployed and found participation in it extremely helpful in terms of assisting them to get back into the labour force.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I have two questions for the Minister.   I am concerned, from a legal point of view, about the structure of voluntary organisations.  There are no checks and balances in place in regard to the structure of many organisations, in particular organisations in which there is no change of personnel over a long period.  There is a need for some accountability in this area.  We need to put in place a template for organisations involved at community level.  I do not believe this is currently being done.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government needs to address this issue.  It is important people do not feel excluded in their communities.  One group should not be allowed remain in charge for a long period to the exclusion of others.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">My second question relates to community employment schemes and whether it is proposed to grow them given the significant number of people looking for something to do.  I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn in this matter.  People want to get involved but there are not sufficient opportunities available to them.  The community sector is one such opportunity.  Is the Department considering an expansion and encouragement of that area in the next year?</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Tá an-diomá orm nach bhfuaireamar deis ráiteas a dhéanamh mar tá go leor ceisteanna gur cheart a árdú le linn na díospoireachta seo.  I am quite disappointed because I do not think this is a real debate but rather more of a back slapping exercise.  The community and voluntary sector which I am in contact with is a sector in crisis.  It is in crisis because of the cutbacks in funding that have happened under the previous Administration and which are being followed through by this Administration. Structures have been dismantled.  A group of people working on a project in Dublin have told me that children are going hungry because of the cut in funding to community and voluntary organisations.  It is a scandal that the House is not delving into the much more substantial issues in the community and voluntary sector.  Many fundamental questions need to be asked about the fundamental philosophy behind the possible centralisation or alignment of the services. Where is the evidence that the services provided under the community and voluntary sector will be served better by alignment with local authorities?</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The Minister stated that the cohesion process resulted in a significant rationalisation of local development structures.  I agree that it did this by reducing the number of structures but I question whether it delivered a better service.  I contend that it did not because in many cases the rationalisation of those local development structures meant that those services were taken away from the communities.  It meant that the people involved in the local development and in different local projects lost the power when the funding was taken away and put into a much more political arena of the local authority which is not necessarily a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I will give a practical example.  I was involved in a local development company in 2008.  I did an analysis of the cost of employing an employee in the local development organisation as opposed to the local authority and the relevant Department.  The figures showed it cost on average €43,000 a year to employ a person in the Department, €73,000 a year in the local authority and only €34,000 in the local development company.  It was much cheaper to employ people locally in those community development projects than to employ them in the more central organisations.  I do not believe there is any evidence to show that the realignment suggested by the Minister is in any way more efficient and will deliver a better service and will serve the people in the communities who are marginalised, who are suffering and who need help.  These people have had their funding cut.  I do not think there is any evidence——</p>

          <p eId="para_511">In reply to Senator Burke's question about a community structures model, I will certainly take on board his suggestion to see if best practice can be streamlined on how structures are established.  It is a matter for the community at local level to decide the length of service of a person.  The situation can arise in both voluntary organisations and those set up through local development companies where rules of engagement have not been devised as to the length of service allowed for a position.  This means that a person may stay in perpetuity.  This is not an easy matter to resolve and it is a matter for the local people.  I will take on board his suggestions on streamlining and consolidation needed in identifying best practice and a model for community structures.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">This is why structures which may be close to the Senator's heart found themselves in difficulties.  They might not be democratic or accountable to anybody except maybe to a Department whereas the democratic accountability should be at local level.  The expansion of community employment schemes is very closely involved with ensuring the people in a community who want to do what Senator Quinn is advocating will be able to work in a structured and supervised way and also with the help of a structure called local government to deliver for the local people.  We are in discussions with the trade union movement and with local government and the Department of Social Protection to roll out in 2012 an expansion of that programme through local government.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">He too has commissioned a separate report under the chairmanship of John McGrane to examine the philanthropic context of not-for-profit arts and culture sectors.  There could be a possibility of duplication and also a bit of enhancement.  I ask the Minister to speak to the officials from that Department to achieve some kind of cohesion.  I am not sure if the report has been published yet but the charity sector, the voluntary sector, the arts sector, are all within the same area and it would be helpful if the Government could launch one report and perhaps synergise both outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I note the Minister's observations with regard to requiring a democratic, accountable and responsible system of local government involving the citizen.  This may not be the opportunity but we would welcome the Minister back on another occasion to discuss how the citizen can become involved in local democratic accountability.  For instance, in the United States taxes are raised and spent locally.  School boards are locally elected and the US citizen can participate in local financial decision-making and the reform of local government.</p>

          <from>Senator Aideen Hayden</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I will make three brief points on contributions from other Senators.  I wish to inform Senator Quinn that Dublin City University has a very active programme of student involvement as part of final qualification for activity in the community.  I refer to what Senator Crown said about philanthropy in the medical sector.  When I was having my second child, I noticed a heart monitor which had been provided by a very famous singer.  I would have preferred if he had been paying more tax and I could have had that heart monitor as part of my basic human and health rights rather than it being a matter of philanthropy.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">While philanthropy is all very good, I have noticed in third level institutions that the State is providing 85% to 90% of the funding for particular buildings, a particularly well-known person, an entrepreneur, gives 10% of the funding and yet the building is not named after the Minister or the State but rather after the person who gave the 10%.  I am exercising a note of caution to the Minister that the State should be receiving congratulations for its contribution rather than the person who gave the 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">As for the issue at hand, the point has been made by other speakers that there are wide divergences.  It is between the community and the voluntary sector and it is in that regard I have a question for the Minister.  Historically, much of the growth of the voluntary sector has arisen by way of gaps identified in the failure of State provision.  Part of the reason certain voluntary organisations have become as large as they are is the failure of statutory bodies to mainstream much of that provision.  Most voluntary organisations have no assurance from year to year in regard to their funding, yet they employ significant numbers of people, have pension and insurance contributions, must pay for buildings and insurance and so forth.  Has the Minister's Department considered promoting biannual funding, at the very least, for these organisations?  I know from experience that some voluntary organisations receive acknowledgment of their annual funding 11 months into the year.  That means the voluntary sector is supporting State activities out of its own resources for 11 of 12 months in the year.  This is untenable.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It is important to bear in mind, too, that the previous Government, in particular, placed much focus on voluntary provision in a number of areas because it deemed this to be more efficient, but mainly because it was cheaper.  A great amount of pressure has been put on the voluntary sector to deliver where certain programmes are being put in place, particularly at local authority level.  Has the Minister any plans to evaluate some of the decisions of the previous Government concerning the placing of this level of emphasis on the voluntary sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I agree completely with the Minister there needs to be cost efficiency, and so forth but it is important to remember this is a two-way street.  Although the voluntary sector has obligations to be efficient and cost effective, the State also has an obligation to the voluntary sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">I acknowledge Senator Hayden's words of caution about philanthropy.  I hope it did not take up too much of my speech.  I certainly do not wish to convey that it is the only issue but I was asked questions about it and responded in that context.  The forum on philanthropy was dormant for a number of years but we have revitalised it in recent months to see what is the best and most structured way for people who are interested in giving and becoming involved in a giving campaign and also to help the very worthy causes that need some assistance.  The State will never be able to cover everything.  However, I sincerely take on board the Senator's observation.  This will be a very small part of the effort we will make towards the community and voluntary sector, in support of the policies we will pursue and the core funding, the other issue she mentioned.  I agree there is a degree of uncertainty.  I inherited a very difficult situation with regard to the community and voluntary sector.  There were many headings that had applied for money but there was no money.  I am streamlining that situation at present to see what we can do to give more certainty to the various organisations in the future.</p>

          <from>Senator Terry Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_544">As a volunteer for more than 40 years, since I was a toddler, I acknowledge the part played by volunteers throughout this country for many years.  As we all know, this is the European Year of Volunteering.  I wish to pay tribute to those from all walks of life, young and old, who, as the Minister remarked, work in their various communities not for profit but to make a difference.  We must acknowledge the difference they make.  The Minister mentioned, for example, 820 tidy towns committees throughout the country who work from January to January to improve their own towns and villages and make them better places to live in and to visit.  They make a significant contribution to tourism.  I often wonder what it would be like if we did not have the GAA, the credit union, tidy towns committees or meals on wheels.  What sort of an Ireland would we have in the 21st century?  It is remiss of us not to recognise the contribution of all these people.  As somebody observed, not all of them get medals or prizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">My question concerns the Leader programme.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  For projects in that programme which are in excess of €200,000, I understand final approval is made by Brussels.  As a public representative, when I hear Brussels, I think of delay, bureaucracy, i's not dotted, whatever.  For communities throughout the country which may have succeeded in raising half their costs and are anxious to get their projects completed, does the Minister envisage any major delays in approval of these various projects?</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I was late so I ask to be forgiven if my questions were already put.  I heard the Minister mention the Leader company in Senator Ó Clochartaigh's neck of the woods.  When will that company be replaced?  Is there any inter-measure in place for community groups that may have received approval under the old Leader company and are now not in a position to access funding, in particular those groups which are ready to act?  I would appreciate any such information from the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_276" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_547">As did Senator Brennan, I acknowledge the contribution of the volunteer sector.  The OECD did a study some time ago on citizen participation and volunteering.  Ireland is the second highest placed in the OECD for citizens volunteering, giving time or money or helping a stranger, with, on average, 60% having done so in the month previous to the carrying out of the survey.  The European average is 39%.  We have a higher recognition on the part of the general public of the need to volunteer and the generous way in which people do so is reflected in that survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">In 2007 there was a task force on active citizenship arising from which 22 volunteer centres were established around the country.  These are funded by my Department.  Core funding is given to Volunteer Ireland, which used to be two organisations, Volunteer Centres of Ireland and Volunteering Ireland, but they merged into one in 2010 and are now focused on the work.  Volunteer Ireland is involved in advocacy, facilitating volunteering for groups that seek community volunteers and supporting the volunteer strategy, and is part of the national co-ordinating body for the European Year of Volunteering in 2011.  It is the host for the 2012 international association of voluntary effort world conference.  Apart from the work it does on the ground, Volunteer Ireland does a great deal of co-ordination work.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Some 55% of Leader funding comes from the European Union which also has a say in how the money is spent.  One would expect any body that puts forward 55% would have some input.  Every Member present knows the European Commission is currently reviewing the rules and regulations concerning Leader funding; I am involved in that.  We will have more certainty in regard to the level of refund and also, one hopes, more flexibility regarding the various programmes Leader delivers.  At the moment, when one gets tied into a certain axis it is very hard for one to come out of it.  I am sure every Member of this House can give examples of this problem, particularly in the food sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Senator Kelly asked about Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG.  Senator Ó Clochartaigh will be interested in this.  I was anticipating that I would be asked about it.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta is an independent company with its own board of management and memorandum and articles of association.  Under company law, the board has responsibility for the proper stewardship of the company.  It has been confirmed that the board of MFG, on examination of the company's financial situation, took a decision to cease trading as of 4 p.m. on 7 September 2011 on the basis of insolvency.  The company is now in liquidation.  MFG was contracted by my Department to deliver two main programmes — axes 3 and 4 of the rural development programme and the local and community development programme.  It also implemented other programmes on behalf of other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The recent dissolution of the company is causing difficulties for project promoters in Gaeltacht areas.  I am trying to resolve those difficulties by considering the structures that can be put in place instead of MFG.  I will examine whether existing structures are able to deal with some of the projects that require payment.  Complex legal issues and contractual obligations have to be resolved by the Department.  I am conscious of the need to speed up the process and provide for early delivery on behalf of the people who have made applications for projects.  I am also conscious of the rights of the staff of MFG under company law.  Although my Department does not have a direct role in or responsibility for this matter, we are monitoring it closely.  A new structure will have to be established to ensure programmes that are vital to communities are delivered as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
          <p eId="para_552">I welcome the Minister to the House for the discussion on this important issue.  I recently met representatives of the Waterford City Community Forum, which advocates on behalf of many community and voluntary organisations in Waterford.  They have been seeking to meet Members of the Oireachtas to discuss the cuts in the funding of the forum itself and the funding of community and voluntary projects across Waterford.  The same thing has been happening across the State.  I am a former voluntary member at management level of the Larchville-Lisduggan community project in Waterford.  I worked as the financial director of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I support a previous Senator who called for the introduction of multi-annual budgets, as that would give certainty to many projects.  I regret the fact that the democratic and voluntary elements of community development projects were undermined when they were brought into the partnership process.  We are discussing the voluntary sector here today.  Many people give up their time voluntarily to do huge amounts of work.  If the services they provide were not provided, it would cost the State more money.  An economic argument could be made to the effect that if we reduce the funding given to the community and voluntary sector and make it more difficult for people to help and assist those organisations in a voluntary capacity, somebody will have to take up the flak.  Some other State agency will have to do what many of these volunteers are currently doing.  I do not think it makes economic sense for us to be cutting funding from many community and voluntary projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">As I wish to be helpful to the Minister, I will make a number of proposals that he might like to take on board.  My first suggestion relates to the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2011, which was discussed in the House recently.  I suggest that we could ring-fence €50 million in funding from dormant accounts for community and voluntary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Second, I suggest we could use the proceeds of crime.  As we are aware, the Criminal Assets Bureau confiscates money and assets from members of criminal gangs and drug dealers who are devastating communities.  I strongly believe that when assets, including money, are seized, their value should be ring-fenced and reinvested back into communities that are being devastated by the activities of criminal gangs and drug dealers.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The third thing that could be considered by the Minister is a VAT refund scheme for charities.  Everybody understands that we are in tightened economic circumstances.  We all understand that the Government is looking to make savings.  The Government has to be clever in what it does.  If it takes funding from community and voluntary projects, especially projects that depend on volunteers, it will make it more difficult for them to provide the much-needed services that many people have spoken about during this debate.  Senators have commended volunteers for their efforts.  If the Government makes it more difficult for them to operate, other State agencies will have to come in and provide those services.  That will cost us more in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I hope the Minister will respond to the specific points I have made about the multi-annual budgeting of State-funded community and voluntary projects and the ways in which money can be ring-fenced.  If the Minister does not support what I have said, perhaps he can tell us where these projects can get the money they require.  Funds need to be ring-fenced to support the community and voluntary projects that do such tremendous work across the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I assure Senator Cullinane that I agree with the biannual funding mechanism for voluntary and community groups.  I am prepared to look at that issue.  However, I am not in a position to ring-fence any money.  That is a matter for the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">That is good.  The issue of the dormant accounts legislation was discussed during the debate.  Disbursements of €267 million were made from dormant accounts to projects of community benefit between the establishment of the fund in April 2003 and the end of August 2011.  Money does not have to be ring-fenced in order for something to happen.  It has happened in this case.  The net value of uncommitted moneys in the fund is €82 million.  Those moneys will be transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which will be responsible for disbursing them at the end of the day.  I expect that unclaimed funds will continue to be used to help disadvantaged communities and increase educational opportunity.  It will be done along the lines of how these programmes were assisted in the past.  The Senator made an interesting point about criminal assets that are ultimately procured by the State.  I will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We are examining the VAT refund scheme in the context of our forum on philanthropy.  The charities legislation that is vested in the Department of Justice and Equality used to be vested in the former Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  We will make some recommendations on VAT to the Minister for Finance in the next couple of weeks.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael Mullins</from>
          <p eId="para_565">I would like to ask two brief questions.  The Minister referred in his speech to the ongoing discussions he is having with trade unions, etc., with a view to possibly being able to extend the range of activity and type of work that can be done under community employment schemes and what used to be known as FÁS schemes.  Local authorities used to look after many activities but, as a result of reductions in resources and manpower, they are no longer in a position to do so.  Many of the schemes to which I refer could be used in a cost-effective and imaginative way to improve the quality of life in communities.  I hope the issues the trade unions have in that regard can be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The Minister has spoken about the realignment of local government and local development.  The local development companies employ significant numbers of people.  Does the Minister envisage that the people employed in those companies will become employees of the local authority when such a realignment takes place?</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" as="#Acting_Chairman" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Acting Chairman (Senator Paschal Mooney)</from>
          <p eId="para_567">As no further Members are offering to ask questions, perhaps the Minister might wish to use the remaining time to address the wider debate as well as responding to Senator Mullins.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_287" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_568">Members were generally interested in how we can align the community with local government.  We have a group that is looking at that issue.  No vested interests are involved in the group.  I want to see how we can achieve that in an independent way, based on people's personal experiences in local government and in the community sector.  We are in an era in which duplication and triplication cannot be afforded.  We want to find the best way of delivering services to citizens, which is the ultimate objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I am a strong proponent of local government, for which I make no apologies.  Local government is democratic.  Its money is audited.  It is accountable and transparent.  Although it delivers local services, it does not deliver enough of them.  I want the system of local government that is in place to deliver local services to citizens in line with the community development sector and with the assistance of the voluntary and community sector.  The debate is about the best structure and mechanism to achieve that in an accountable and an open way.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Senator Keane mentioned local Leader groups and local development.  We are in discussions with the European Commission to see if we can achieve a little bit more flexibility in transferring money from one programme to another.  If we do not achieve that, there will be a surplus of money in Brussels at the end of 2013, which we will not be able to spend.  In the current climate, we will do everything we can to avoid that.  However, we are working with our partners in the European Union to see what we can do to resolve the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Senator Ó Murchú and others mentioned the scheme to support national community and voluntary organisations.  That small scheme has a budget of €4 million and it provides core costs to 64 national community and voluntary organisations, including many organisations involved in advocacy.  In this year's round of funding under the scheme, there were 149 applications and 64 were successful.  One cannot expect it to do everything one wants it to do with €4 million but I am trying to maintain that level of expenditure in next year's budget.  Perhaps that funding can leverage other synergies with local government, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">An independent mechanism was set up in order to deal with these applications.  All successful applicants knew exactly what the criteria were before they applied.  Senator van Turnhout will be disappointed that funding for some of the national organisations had to be cut in order to facilitate others.  One cannot win when one has a small budget but I understand from where she is coming.  I will review the scheme at the end of the year to see what criteria will apply for 2012 and to be able to give more certainty early on in the year for people who are successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Some €63 million is available under the local and community development programme.  That is a lot of money which can leverage a lot of activity.  I hope we will be able to maintain that next year.  That is tied into our European Union contribution which I suppose is helpful from my perspective because one must have 45% in one's budget in order to draw down the remaining 55% from the European Commission.  It does not make sense not to take advantage of the money that is available in the European Union programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The role of local authorities in regard to community issues is a central point which Senator Landy made.  I have a lot of experience of local government, as has Senator Landy.  I see the valuable work which goes on but I also see that local government neglected the community sector.  A distance was created between the community and voluntary sector and local government because local authorities did not set up the appropriate structures or conversations, especially in the light of programmes coming on stream through the European Union.  That was a mistake by local government and I am seeking to ensure it rectifies that.  It must also show a better culture towards the community development work going on in every community with the help of an enormous number of people who do not get paid for anything but who are doing good work on behalf of the community they represent.  I want to ensure we are in a position to draw together all the structures, funds and programmes available in every community and to have a dialogue about the best structures to deliver those services to the people which, ultimately, is what it is all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The local development social inclusion programme and community development programme were redesigned with a view to drawing on best international practice.  We drew on evidence of what works in this field in order to establish arrangements for the ongoing re-evaluation of the programme.  The LCDP encapsulates the best elements of the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme.  At one time, there were 163 structures and there are now 52, which is enough.  They are more efficient and we were able to make a lot of savings.  There has been a 6% reduction in funding for the entire programme and only a 3% reduction in the money going to the citizen and the groups.  That answers that question.  I thank Senators for their time.</p>

          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill</from>
          <p eId="para_580">We must recognise the importance of the Bill.  Much work was done on this Bill, both by the Minister of State, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his ministerial predecessor.  It is an indication of that work and co-operation between politicians and the industry that the House has unanimously passed the Bill without any division.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The protection and welfare of animals, whether they be greyhounds or any other animal, is vitally important not only to agriculture and the good name of farming but to society in general.  It is important that this Bill is stand-alone legislation removed from the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and that it gives very clear and definitive recognition to the greyhound industry, which is an industry known at home and abroad for its sporting excellence.  Representatives of the industry would certainly welcome this Bill, which provides a clear, legal definition for where the industry stands in respect of the protection of animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I commend the Minister of State for following through with this Bill.  I am glad that it has passed here and I know that the industry will welcome it.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael Comiskey</from>
          <p eId="para_584">We are delighted to have the Minister of State back again and I am delighted to speak on the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011, which is before us for discussion.  We discussed the Bill at length on Second Stage on 25 October.  The Bill arose from the debate last year on the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  It must be highlighted that one of the major strengths of the greyhound industry in Ireland is that all greyhounds are identified and registered individually in the stud book of the Irish Coursing Club to ensure the integrity of the racing system.  The industry already has provisions in place with regard to welfare.  I will not repeat to the information in great detail as it was adequately debated and discussed at length the last day.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">According to Bord na gCon, the greyhound industry is responsible for 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs, directly and indirectly, many of which are in rural communities.  The industry provides an estimated €500 million for the local economy.  The greyhound breeding sector is also very successful, and approximately 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK are Irish.  The industry also attracts many tourists to Ireland and it is therefore of paramount importance that we protect and enhance it through the most stringent regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I would like to recap briefly the main points of the Bill.  The Bill grants a wide range of powers to welfare officers to allow them to specify various items of welfare notices.  However, these provisions will not present any difficulty to individuals who take due recognition of the welfare requirements, have proper premises and operate their businesses in co-operation with local veterinary practices, as appropriate.  The Bill provides for a period of up to three months from the commencement of the Act for greyhound breeding establishments to be registered.  It will be lawful for dog breeding establishments to continue to operate for this period and will enable a smooth transition to full registration of greyhound breeding establishments.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Bord na gCon will be responsible for the establishment of a code of practice under section 6 of the Bill.  Under section 11, it will be an offence to allow a female greyhound to give birth more than six times during her lifetime.  Section 12 provides for the establishment of a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  Finally, section 18 of the Bill outlines that a welfare officer or member of the Garda Síochána may inspect premises and may require books, records or any other documents to be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The social aspect is very important.  It must be remembered that this industry provides great entertainment for all people and greatly enhances Ireland's tourism industry.  It has been brought to my attention that greyhounds are sometimes abandoned at greyhound tracks if they do not win their races.  I would like to affirm that the introduction of this new Act will protect greyhounds from mistreatment as, under the new law, each greyhound will be fully traceable back to its original owner.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">It is important that the greyhound industry is regulated in the same way as any other industry in Ireland.  The enactment of this Bill into law at a future date will ensure that greyhounds are protected from any undesirable treatment and will establish tight regulations for the future.  I thank the Minister of State for addressing the House on this Bill and for his work in overseeing the passage of the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorOClochartaigh" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_590">Thar ceann Shinn Féin, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an reachtaíocht seo.  Táimid ag tacú leis an mBille.  Tá áthas orainn go bhfuil sé ag dul tríd.  Creidimid go léiríonn an díospóireacht seo go raibh an ceart ag Sinn Féin nuair a dúirt muid gur chóir go ndéanfaí scarúint idir an reachtaíocht seo agus an reachtaíocht a bhaineann le madraí i gcoitinne.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Sinn Féin welcomes this Bill and we are happy to support it.  The discussion today shows that Sinn Féin was correct when it called for the separation of a Bill dealing with the welfare of greyhounds from the general Dog Breeding Establishments Act and other animal welfare legislation.  This course of action has proven to be wise.  Although we all agree that the industry is extremely important and we all support it, as has been outlined by previous Senators, there are certain questions that are raised.  At the peak of the industry, approximately 25,000 greyhounds were born in Ireland every year, which is a huge number compared with other countries.  Typically, only 80 greyhounds were adopted into Irish homes per year, while between 430 and 450 were adopted into European homes at the end of their racing lives.  Some 40,000 greyhounds are unaccounted for annually, which is still a serious cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">We acknowledge, however, the contribution made by the vast majority of those involved in greyhound racing and coursing to the sporting and cultural landscape of Ireland, particularly rural Ireland, and to the welfare of dogs.  This industry is also important in providing employment, sport and recreation for thousands of people, who have shown great dedication to the sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The vast majority of greyhound people show a fantastic commitment to the welfare of their animals.  The familiar scene of local greyhound trainers out with their dogs in the early hours of the morning is one repeated in villages, towns and cities throughout the island.  The greyhound industry itself is significant.  It is a good industry and I have no doubt that 90% of the people involved treat their animals well and have animal welfare high on their list of priorities.  However, a percentage of those involved are treating their animals in a manner that could be improved.  The greyhound racing industry is often regarded as difficult to regulate and that is one of the questions that will arise.  It is important to enact a Bill such as this, but it is also important to put the resources in place to make sure it can be enforced.  There is no point in giving people monitoring powers and so on if the resources are not available to ensure it is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">We must not forget that the greyhound industry is just that — an industry.  Its aim is to produce pedigree dogs in a competitive environment where the working life of a top-class greyhound is very short.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to protect the welfare of these animals, and the Bill provides for this, but only if it is implemented and enforced.  We welcome the expansion of powers for welfare officers from Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and local authorities, which will enable them to issue welfare notices and, where necessary, to seize greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">In general, we support the Bill and are glad it has been passed.  We would like to see similar Bills applying to the horse and showjumping industries as that area is in need of similar attention.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Aire agus buíochas a ghabháil leis as ucht an reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt os gcomhair an Tí.  Tá áthas orainn go bhfuil tacaíocht á thabhairt dúinn don mBille seo.  Mhol muid go gcuirfí ar aghaidh é.  Tacaíonn Sinn Féin leis an mBille seo.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisLandy" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Senator Denis Landy</from>
          <p eId="para_596">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him for the work he has done.  We fully support this Bill.  On Second Stage I raised a number of issues with the Minister of State.  One of these was to do with the carrying out of inspections and whether the required manpower would be available, as mentioned by the previous speaker, Senator Ó Clochartaigh.  I also raised the issue of how to deal with people who are in breach of the legislation in terms of regulating their future activity within the industry.  I am extremely pleased with the interaction I have had with the Minister of State and his Department since then.  Confirmation has been given that there are adequate facilities within the Irish Coursing Club to deal with this issue should the matter arise, and that there are already provisions within the ICC to deal with people who are in breach of the legislation in terms of their future activity within the industry.  I am pleased that both of those issues, which I feel are extremely important, were dealt with by the Minister of State and his staff.  I have received communications clarifying these points.  At the time, I know the Minister of State was concerned about these issues himself, however, my contact with the ICC has confirmed that they have been dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">This is good legislation.  The Minister of State mentioned the last day that if a similar approach had been taken by the last Government, namely, taking a mature approach to this issue instead of dealing with it as part of an overall plan to improve the welfare of animals, including the banning of hunting and so on, that Government might still be in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">One sign that this is good legislation is that it has been accepted by all sides of the House.  Another is the availability of clarification and the willingness of those concerned to engage with us on issues of importance such that there were no amendments to the Bill, an excellent sign with any legislation.  It will be good and I have no concerns about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">A compliance figure of 90% within the industry was mentioned.  I have been involved in the industry as a punter, an owner and otherwise throughout the years.  It is safe to say that 99% of people involved in the greyhound industry are compliant.  There may be 1% in any walk of life who are not compliant and for whom all this legislation is required.  However, people from all walks of life are involved, in the main, for the love of the animal and the sport.  Some people participate on a professional basis and make a living out of it but these people are more in love with the animals than anyone else and I have seen at first hand the care and attention given to greyhounds by professional dog trainers throughout the country.  This is a good day for the greyhound industry in Ireland, it is a good day for the welfare of the greyhound and it is good legislation.  I commend the Minister of State for today's work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
          <p eId="para_602">The message is clear: when one gets involved in something, if one brings everyone along and allows everyone to have their say, it is better.  I know from my responsibility, as does the senior Minister from his responsibility, that people in the greyhound industry welcome this legislation.  Like those in every other industry they are going through a hard patch.  Any legislation that strengthens their position and which is related to the welfare of their dogs is helpful.  The people themselves have no wish to be taught in any other way.  This is why we have the retirement home for greyhounds.  While I have never had a greyhound as a pet, any dog can mean so much to a family and can be great company, especially for someone who is on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The Bill is going through and other Bills will follow.  If one were to pick out one element of the legislation that is memorable, it is that the person to whom the dog is registered is responsible at the end of the day.  It is like the case of the car.  Great legislation was introduced relating to cars so that whoever was the last owner was responsible.  If anything goes wrong with a dog that person is responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The legislation is in place to punish.  Senators are aware of how much people love their greyhounds and I hope this will help the business.  As Senators said, rightly, there may be questions on certain aspects and the horse industry must be examined as well.  If anyone has any queries on anything related to agriculture, they should lift the telephone to contact me.  It need not take three or four weeks to get an answer.  It is a great way of working.  I thank everyone responsible for getting this legislation through.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to bring the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 before Seanad Éireann.  I thank the various Senators who took the time to examine the relevant issues and for their support in progressing this legislation.  The contributions have been very useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The greyhound industry makes a significant contribution to the economy and it should be recognised that it is an export-orientated industry, as evidenced by the fact that approximately 75% of the greyhounds that currently race in the United Kingdom were bred in Ireland.  Legislation to enhance greyhound welfare is crucial for the further development of the industry.  The provisions in the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 take account of the well-established controls that the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon have in place already.  This legislation provides a sound legal basis for welfare inspections to be carried out at all premises where greyhounds are kept.  The Bill grants a wide range of powers to welfare officers and empowers them to issue welfare notices outlining improvements where they are required.  The Bill allows for local authorities to appoint welfare officers in addition to those appointed by the Irish Coursing Club and Bord na gCon.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">In drawing up the welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011, my Department engaged with several organisations concerned with the welfare of dogs.  In this regard I thank the various bodies such as Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and various NGOs, such as the Dogs Trust, all of which engaged with the drafting in a helpful manner.  It was agreed in the discussions with these bodies that the restriction this Bill places on the number of times a greyhound bitch can be bred as well as the prohibition on breeding a bitch under 15 months are significant factors in greyhound welfare.  I thank the secretariat of the House who facilitated the Bill.  I am satisfied this legislation, which is comprehensive and appropriately pitched, will ensure a good standard of welfare for greyhounds.  Again, I thank all Members of the House.</p>

            <from>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</from>
            <p eId="para_610">I welcome the Minister of State again.  He has been here two weeks in a row.  I call on the Minister for Social Protection to justify how self-employed PRSI contributions can be taken from an individual while that individual, a self-employed person, is entitled to nothing and to no financial contribution when injured or ill through no fault of his or her own.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">Self-employed people in Ireland pay an S class social insurance payment as mandatory.  The payment stands at 4% of earnings of all reckonable income above €5,000 or €253, whichever is greater.  This contribution entitles the payee to class S benefits, including widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension contributions; guardian payments contributory; State pension contributory; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit; and bereavement grant.  Unlike most other classes of social insurance payments, class S PRSI does not provide cover for any other schemes or benefits such as jobseeker's, occupational injuries or illness benefits.  The Minister of State knows that in the current downturn self-employed people, not just their employees, have suffered high levels of unemployment.  They have paid not just their own but PRSI but employers' too.  The situation seems to be totally unjust.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Many people have raised this issue with me and have asked why they are the fall guys.  The rules governing PRSI contributions by the self-employed, which prevent access to State support, are causing unnecessary financial hardship for some families and need to be urgently reviewed.  In addition, if we wish to foster and encourage enterprise and self-employment in Ireland we must seriously address this issue, something all members of the Government are trying to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">It is absolute madness to expect self-employed people to pay a compulsory social insurance payment which provides no cover whatsoever if they are injured or become ill through no fault of their own.  Many self-employed people now find themselves without work through illness and injury and are not covered by PRSI as a result of the rules governing contributions made by the self-employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">I have met at least three people in my office about this issue.  The livelihood of one man is at risk and he brought the detail of his situation to me.  We need to explore the UK model which allows self-employed people to become employees in certain situations and pay PRSI contributions which offer protection when individuals become sick or injured and cannot work.  It is a reasonable proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">One such example where this situation is causing serious hardship for people and their families is the case of a self-employed man who has paid taxes and PRSI since 2000.  When he was injured in a road traffic accident, having been rear-ended by a drunk driver, he was shocked to discover he was not entitled to any injury or sickness payment while incapacitated and unable to work in July and August 2010 or following corrective surgery during July, August and September 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">In order to meet his financial obligations and living expenses on a daily basis he has had to arrange an overdraft with his bank, something which should have been paid for by sickness benefit.  He has told me that while he could take out private insurance in the future at a cost of €300 for an annual premium providing benefits of €500 per week in the case of not being able to work due to injury, he cannot afford to pay for State and private insurance and illness is still not covered by either.  If he had invested a small sum of money in private insurance rather than in the State he would have benefited from injury cover.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">Self-employed people cannot continue to bear the burden whereby they are entitled to less from their social insurance contributions than their employees.  It is strange that an employer, who is the multiplier and has the responsibility to pay employer and personal contributions, is entitled to nothing if he or she falls ill or becomes injured, especially when a self-employed person pays more in contributions than employees.  The situation is grossly unfair and cannot be allowed to continue in a State which is crying out for people to become self-employed to help drive recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">I ask the Minister, through the Minister of State, to justify how the PRSI contributions of the self-employed can be paid, yet those who pay it are entitled to nothing when they become ill or are injured through no fault of their own.  I look forward to the response.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanSherlock" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_302">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_619">Access to certain social insurance payments, which are based on PRSI contributions, differ between employees and the self-employed.  While employees and the self-employed are liable to PRSI at the rate of 4%, employers also make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of employees, bringing the PRSI payment in respect of employees to a combined 14.75% rate per employee under the full class A rate.  As a result, ordinary employees can build entitlement towards the full range of social welfare benefits based on the higher level of contribution.  Class S self-employed contributions provide cover for long-term benefits, such as the State contributory pension, widow's or widower's pension or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">I am keenly aware of the very difficult financial position self-employed people are now in.  We have all heard cases in our clinics and advice centres, in particular small business owners who find themselves in a very precarious financial position.  However, we have to strike a balance between contributions made and benefits received.  PRSI coverage is related to the risks associated with employment or self-employment, the annualised system of contributions for self-employed people and the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payment for self-employed people.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within the social insurance context, such as this, is common in other European social protection systems.  In this context, it should be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared with employees.  The 2005 actuarial review of the social insurance fund found it favours the self-employed over the employed when employer and employee contributions are included in respect of the employed person.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">For example, a male married self-employed contributor earning gross average industrial wages had a value for money index of 10.3 compared with an index of 3.1 for an equivalent employee.  In basic terms this means that, with regard to benefits, the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over ten times what he or she contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who, even with access to a broader range of benefits, only gets three times what he or she and his or her employer contributes.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">The analysis demonstrates that, despite the fact that they are eligible for a narrower range of benefits, self-employed persons can gain substantially more from the fund than employees.  It should be noted that the State contributory pension increased in excess of inflation and earnings growth in the period up to 2010 while annuities offer CPI linked increases at best.  The market cost of an inflation linked annuity with €12,000 a year in initial benefits is in excess of €300,000, without any associated survivor's benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Any changes to the PRSI system in order to provide access to short-term benefits such as social insurance illness-related benefits would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, established the advisory group on tax and social welfare earlier this year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.  It will examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether it is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">I referred to illness and injury.  Why is coverage not available for such cases, even at a greater cost?  Can the Minister of State give me a commitment that the question I put to him will be submitted to the advisory group on tax and social welfare in order that it is considered, with a view to ensuring that anybody who finds himself or herself in such a situation has the right to buy benefits for illness and injury, albeit at a higher cost?</p>

            <p eId="para_630">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  In a previous Adjournment matter I tabled on foot of the job losses in TalkTalk, I raised the issue of the need for a university for the south east and for Waterford Institute of Technology to be designated as a university.  At the time the Minister gave a commitment that he would visit WIT and he has done so.  He will have seen the outstanding facilities there, including the ICT building, which was completed in October 2004; the nurse education building, which commenced in September 2004; the enterprise research centre; the tourism building; and the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG.  All of the building blocks have been put in place by Waterford Institute of Technology.  The Port report, which first looked at the application by WIT for a university, stated that Waterford had the academic maturity and an activity profile that was similar to universities in Ireland and other western countries.  It also mentioned the governance, management and strategic planning capabilities required of a university and stated that Waterford had all of those, along with an attractive and suitable campus environment and a secure asset base to permit future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">In the wake of what has happened in Waterford city and the recent Government decisions, one  being to locate the headquarters of the VEC in Wexford rather than Waterford city which has caused dismay, there is a need for the Government to accelerate this issue.  It has talked about a multi-campus technological university and the Minister for Education and Skills has spoken about this recently.  The question is what would that mean?  The Minister spoke about the creation of a new technological university status which would complement our existing universities in meeting the full range of needs of students and the wider society.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">The reason we are seeking a university is that the south east has been operating with one hand tied behind its back for far too long.  Waterford city is the only gateway city without a university while the south east region has the critical mass of a population of almost 500,000.  While I accept the Minister is looking at a multi-campus technological university the question the people in Waterford will ask is whether that will put Waterford into the top tier of university provision?  The Minister ruled out the application made by Waterford Institute of Technology for simple designation and referred to comparisons with polytechnics in the UK.  The major fear is that while some move might be made for Waterford, other ITs across the State might get a similar lift and then it will not be what the people of Waterford are seeking.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">The issues around the application centre on funding.  A university brings in more funding especially in the areas of research and development.  Branding is important but not just in terms of a name change.  There is no point in simply calling Waterford Institute of Technology a technological university if it is simply a beefed up institute of technology.  It must be a fully fledged university that has the capabilities to meet the needs of the people of the south east.  It is important in any future decisions that are made that Waterford Institute of Technology — I hope it will be a university — will have the same autonomy as the nine other universities in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">Not all of the opposition from outside Waterford to Waterford Institute of Technology being made a university is political.  Opposition is also coming from the other nine universities.  University politics has been at the heart of much of what has happened in regard to this issue for far too long.  That is why I welcome the Minister's commitment to at least look at this issue and examine the possibility of a technological university.  I see that as a step forward.  However, the critical issue is one of equality in that Waterford and the south east should be on a par with every other region in the country.  We cannot continue to limp along, playing second fiddle to all the other regions, trying to compete with regions which have universities, including the educational hub and opportunities for research and development which Waterford city does not have.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">I mentioned the decision in regard to the VEC amalgamation.  Many would have seen the decision to place the headquarters in Wexford rather than Waterford as political.  In addition, IDA Ireland regional offices were moved out of Waterford city to Cork and elsewhere.  To many in Waterford it appears that the State agencies and Departments have consistently let Waterford down.  One thing that could be done quickly is to approve the application by Waterford Institute of Technology for a university to meet the needs of the people of Waterford, the business community, and the students who want to avail of university qualifications in their own city without the necessity to travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">I spoke recently with Dr. Mark Rowe, chair of the Friends of the University of the South East.  He is quite supportive of the idea of a technological university but will await the detail and see what emerges from the Government.  He mentioned the brain drain from Waterford and the south east.  That is, perhaps, one of the reasons we cannot compete for the jobs to enable Waterford city to function as the key economic driver of the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">The national spatial strategy designated Waterford as the gateway city because Waterford should be the capital of the region.  A strong economic performance from Waterford will result in a stronger region and Waterford city has to be the economic engine of the south east.  Unfortunately, it is not being given the capacity by State agencies or by the previous Government and others to enable it reach its potential.  There is huge potential in Waterford and it can be unlocked if the right decisions are made by the Government.  I hope this will be the right decision.  What action has been taken since the Minister for Education and Skills announced he would accelerate this issue and what are his future plans?  When will Waterford hear a positive announcement from the Government that will lift the mood of the people in Waterford and the south east?</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_638">I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  The national strategy for higher education to 2030, otherwise known as the Hunt report, lays out a clear possible development pathway for amalgamated institutes of technology, which meet specified performance criteria, to seek redesignation as technological universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Following publication of the higher education strategy, the Department commissioned input from an international expert, familiar with the Irish higher education sector, on the detailed performance criteria against which any future applications for redesignation as a technological university would be assessed.  In its statutory advisory capacity, the Minister then asked the Higher Education Authority for its formal advice on final appropriate performance criteria.  A consultation process on draft criteria has been undertaken by the HEA and it is understood that the HEA hopes to sign off its formal advice to the Minister at a meeting of the authority later this month.  Following consideration of this, the Minister aims to be in a position to publish the designation criteria and the process arrangements before the end of December.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">The establishment of a technological university will also require legislation and this will be advanced as part of the overall work programme for implementation of the higher education strategy.  However, the first step is to provide clarity on the performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  It is important to repeat that it has to be done in an informed and balanced way.  It would not be right to designate a particular structure as a technological university at this stage, it must go through a proper academic and formal consultation process while retaining the need to ensure the commitment is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Any decision must be made on the basis of sound academic and performance-related criteria.  The first step is to provide clarity on those performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way.  Once a process is in place, it will be open to institutes of technology to come together to make applications for consideration for redesignation.  That is an eminently sensible approach.  All applications, including any involving Waterford Institute of Technology, will be considered under an independent assessment process.  This is a necessary prerequisite of upholding the quality and international reputation of the higher education system.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">There is a clear understanding, on a cross-party political basis, of the need to ensure there is balanced regional development, as referred to by Senator Cullinane.  I acknowledged during a recent visit to Waterford Institute of Technology, including the TSSG centre, that world-class research is being carried out there.  It is an exceptional entity of which people in the Waterford region can be very proud.  The capability and capacity are there, but we must go through a process.  Moreover, it must be a logical and informed process rather than a knee-jerk reaction which could create an entity that is not self-sustaining.  We must ensure that whatever is created can sustain itself and compete with other institutions.  We should also take into account that there are as many students on the campus of Stanford University in California as there are in third level institutions throughout the Twenty-six Counties.  We must think relatively and be careful of how we proceed.</p>

            <from>Senator David Cullinane</from>
            <p eId="para_644">I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has done more on this issue in the months he has been in office than his various predecessors did over many years.  That is most welcome.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, stated in his reply: "The first step is to provide clarity on those performance criteria, which will enable institutes of technology to consider their future options in an informed way."  The concern in Waterford is that any change might amount to no more than a name change, with institutes of technology designated as first tier or second tier and the latter perhaps redefined as technological universities but without being on a par with the other nine universities.  While I accept there may be logic in having technological universities, there is legitimate concern in Waterford Institute of Technology in this regard.  Going back to the point I made about the nurse education building and the humanities courses provided by Waterford IT, how will they fit into a technological university?  That is another legitimate concern.  Nevertheless, I welcome the positive moves made by the Government thus far.  It has done more in recent months than previous Administrations have done for many years.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">I acknowledge the legitimate concerns expressed by the Senator.  The institute of technology sector of itself is very much engaged on those points, particularly in regard to the humanities and the social sciences side as they pertain to the sector.  I am also confident those questions have arisen in the context of deliberations on the Hunt report.  Nevertheless, I will convey the concerns outlined by the Senator directly to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.</p>
